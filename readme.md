### Environment
Anaconda is required for this project to function. Theoretically, you could install these packages with pip only,
but it probably won't work right.

#### Anaconda
Included in the root of the project is an anaconda environment .yml file.
This was exported using the command `conda env export > environment.yml`.


You can *import* this environment by creating a new conda environment while specifying it
as the source `conda env -f encironment.yml` and then activating it.

#### Pip
For requirements that aren't included in the anaconda environment, you can install the rest of the
necessary packages by using pip's `requirement.txt` file - also located in the root of this project.
**Always install through anaconda first and THEN pip.**
