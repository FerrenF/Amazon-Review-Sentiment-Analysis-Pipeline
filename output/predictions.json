Happiness for Beginners has a good plot line and it 's well - developed but the unnecessary foul language which is so much a part of young society today is still a showstopper for some . For those who do not object to vulgarity , this is an enjoyable light read that can be enjoyed part - time for about a week .

Unfortunately , the plot was undeveloped , and the food descriptions were so distracting that it was hard to read however , I kept going . I even began to cheer for the female protagonist as she struggled to find herself . Once I was finally compelled enough to finish the book , the ending slapped me in the face . SPOILERS The female protagonist , a career woman with a love for food , finds true love for her coworker , an arrogant misogynist . And on top of that - he validates her existence so much that she magically becomes happy content in herself and her life and she loses weight ? Perhaps this is a \" happy ending \" that was lost in translation , but to me , this was highly offensive , and had the opposite effect , at least on me . The book could have finished without this very outdated conclusion , which seemed tacked on to the end .",

A pregnant teen , lost and confused by her situation , a young widow and her six year old daughter who have not gotten over the death of a spouse and a dad , and a divorced contractor who comes to town to visit his aunt along with his six year old daughter can you tell where this might be going ?

The characters and humor popped off the page , and the setting was a vivid recollection of the city which I especially appreciated because I grew up in New York . But the book is not just a portrait of Manhattan , it 's Rosenthal 's portrait of Manhattan . It 's about her relationship with the city and with being young and insecure and inspired and in search of one 's identity IN the city . I think this is one reason why the title spells the city 's name incorrectly - because this Manhattan is a private Manhatten , a skewed Manhatten . I loved this aspect of it , this searching for your footing in the big city that is only just a symbol or microcosm of the big world . I certainly had my own private relationship with Manhattan as a young adult , and this brought me back to that time of uncertainty , excitement , and the sense that everything simultaneously hangs in the balance and lies up ahead .",

It did not convey as much wretchedness about the Congo as I had anticipated from reviews , but rather just showed the cultural difference between a European sailor and the natives of the Congo .

One fish , two fish . rEd fIsH , bLUe fiSh . It belongs on the book shelf next to the watchman , the dark knight returns , mass and bone . buy this .

The book shares the story of a COVID - era girl dealing with returning to school , her own prejudice , being biracial , racism , and pollution . It does a good job of showing how young people face very serious issues every day , and how they can deal with them and learn together . I really disliked the illustrations because all of the characters looked exactly the same . They were all stick thin with identically shaped faces - girls , boys , old , and young were all depicted with the same bodies . The only differences were hair and skin tone which is pretty disappointing in a book that deals with racism . The extreme thinness of all the characters does n't set a very good example for kids reading the book either . It 's sad to see a good book brought down by poor illustration choices .",
