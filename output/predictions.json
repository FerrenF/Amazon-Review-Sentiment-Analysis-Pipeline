I really do enjoy chrysler szarlans 34the haley book of the dead34 that I feel like I have to explain the star because in spite of that seemingly middling rank I still very much want another book because this book hint at the potential of a much well book to come.yet for this book the plot be a mix of paranormal and murder mystery and from the very first page the reader know that there be tension with daughter miss then it flow into what may seem the starting spot wherein the lead protagonist eve short for revelation which be a family name maskalyne , kill her magician husband jeremy when the gun she normally use for a magic trick be switch with a real load gun.there be a bit plasticity to these opening scene and frankly I be glad to be out of vegas and in five corner and haley so the real story begin the man who kill her husband be still stalk they so eve return to her hometown at the urging of her grandmother she also take back her maiden name of dyer it be not just to camouflage herself and her daughter but also a return to a tradition of the dyer woman use their maiden names.i like how szarlan also bring in the viewpoint of the daughter 15 year old grace and faith along with ten year old rayleigh even though most of the book be tell from first person narration of reve.once eve and family be back in five corner eve begin to piece together her family legacy and how it may affect she it also lead she back to her childhood friend and first love who be now the chief of police in hawley . not that eve be fully ready for a romance so soon after lose her husband but the connection be there nonetheless.intereste part of the book be when szarlan tantalize with the use of magic but she also up the tension with the addition of another murder of revs college friend many year prior at first this addition seem tack on but it actually do work later in the story.my issue with the story be that there just seem a little too much go on that there be time when I d get mix up with the different revelation we never really get more of the be vegas situation the main villain never really feel like much of a threat we know he s a problem early on but once we get to the revelation it be thin and underexplained so I feel a let down at the end that I can not quite shake off.but again the potential be there for a solid series more use of american history and folklore and how the dyer line figure into it more development for the daughter who also have magic in they just more development for all the character as eve dig more into her legacy and the town as well",
