This is a morose, but seemingly true tale of life in the 1960's. I don't imagine things are much different now. Our protagonist, although he has a degree from Harvard, has fallen on hard times. Maybe through his own error. Does it matter? There is a random element to life. His family does not even own a car. There is nothing romantic about poverty. Our protagonist begins to contemplate what he is willing to do to improve his circumstances. The early 60's were a time of relative prosperity, and he has somehow fallen behind. He sees others engaging in bad behaviors with relative impunity. At some point the book becomes meandering and quite difficult to follow. I would not describe it as a pleasant read. Everybody in town has some kind of sordid secret which comes to light. I imagine that is the point. I read it twice, maybe 10 years apart, and both times felt like I had missed something.

This series of shorts follows a universe set in motion by a character named John Wayfinder who puts the reader in the near and far futures of humanity following an alien event. Nearly all of the stories overlap in some branched way and somehow are all connected into exploring a unique idea of becoming\"unstuck\"in the universe a premise that a single person can move forward and backward through time along a created universe, to recruit an unlikely team to rid the timeline of his own mistake. A genuinely fun and lighthearted sci-fi read, there are moments where action takes over logic and launches us readers into a void where we question motive over moral. A solid read throughout.

I even began to cheer for the female protagonist as she struggled to find herself. Once I was finally compelled enough to finish the book, the ending slapped me in the face. SPOILERS The female protagonist, a career woman with a love for food, finds true love for her coworker, an arrogant misogynist. And on top of that-he validates her existence so much that she magically becomes happy content in herself and her life and she loses weight? Perhaps this is a\"happy ending\"that was lost in translation, but to me, this was highly offensive, and had the opposite effect, at least on me. The book could have finished without this very outdated conclusion, which seemed tacked on to the end.","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Perfect!","text":"Perfect!.

The characters and humor popped off the page, and the setting was a vivid recollection of the city which I especially appreciated because I grew up in New York. But the book is not just a portrait of Manhattan, it's Rosenthal's portrait of Manhattan. It's about her relationship with the city and with being young and insecure and inspired and in search of one's identity IN the city. I think this is one reason why the title spells the city's name incorrectly-because this Manhattan is a private Manhatten, a skewed Manhatten. I loved this aspect of it, this searching for your footing in the big city that is only just a symbol or microcosm of the big world. I certainly had my own private relationship with Manhattan as a young adult, and this brought me back to that time of uncertainty, excitement, and the sense that everything simultaneously hangs in the balance and lies up ahead.","symbols":""},{"label":0,"rating":5.0,"title":"Perfect condition.

One. the views are overwhelmingly pro-guerrilla and secondly her prose is too melodramatic. Nevertheless, this is an important book that documents the suffering of the rural and urban poor war inside Colombia. Two quotes stuck in my mind when I finished this book. The first was by Laura who said,\"the hatred against those who persecute and murder us kept me in the struggle.\"And Angela who said,\"I continue to be convinced we must keep dying, giving birth and bringing up soldiers for the revolution.\"On a positive note, all the voices in this book conclude that a nonviolent and just solutions must be sought in Colombia.

Though their target was another age group, I noticed that, if you looked close enough, the situations, comments, et. , portrayed in the books hinted at a world of values that had permeated the fantasy story without burdening it without need. Afterwards, I read The Casual Vacancy and was confirmed in my theory. Now, with the first Cormoran Strike book, I was once again confirmed that, quite apart from the HP books, JKR is a writer on her own right. Come to think of it, the HP books are also a kind of whodunnit.

His writing is meticulously clear, the examples work or at least get you nine-tenths of the way there, and the chapters on actual APIs PayPal, eBay, FedEx, Google, et. are useful. Of course, I'd have loved even more chapters on still other APIs there are so many, but you'll probably learn enough about Web APIs from these examples to tackle any not covered. Easy download access to the source code is also appreciated. I was personally less interested in the section on Web Feeds, but this is also well presented-interestingly in context as a counterpart of Web APIs. One final word To get the most out of this book, you need to be an intermediate level PHP programmer. If you're not, I recommend\"PHP and MySQL Web Development\"by Welling and Thomson as a good way to get there-particularly if you're interested in tapping the power of MySQL along with PHP.

Unbelievably the South came close to winning this unequal contest. To contend that the South failed because of lack of will is historic and a contemptible insult to the brave rebels who fell under the stars and bars. A better judge of Southern will during that war was General Grant who, while attacking the Southern cause, admitted that never had men fought harder for a cause than the Southerners.","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Five Stars","text":"Five Stars.

I found this book to be particularly effective at explaining what happened in the lead-up to the fall of the Soviet Union, much better than some of my high school and college textbooks did. This book reads like a collection of well stitched together short stories. I was quite depressed to finish it, as it was one of the best books I've ever read.","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Lots of keeper recipes","text":"Lots of keeper recipes.

Trying to avoid the stove and oven as much as possible, we went back to this book and tried some more of the recipes. Note that many of the recipes call for meat or fish so you can't avoid heating altogether. What we've found is many great and diverse recipes.

There were no real surprises since it's clear fairly early on what's happening and generally why, although the particulars and the how it plays out remains to be discovered. The biggest problem was I did not care about any of the characters. There was nothing that made them individual or alive to me and nothing that kept me interested in what happened to them.

The author then walks us through the lineage and the evolution of the game consoles both by Nintendo, as well as its competitors Sega, Sony, and Microsoft Xbox. Not surprisingly, the Mario theme is threaded throughout the history of Nintendo-it is, after all, arguably the most successful game franchise ever. The book is a mix of business history and reporting, mixed with some humor and author's own commentary, which makes for a light and fun read.

There are stories which have been translated into Interlingua therefore there should be enough material to keep a beginner busy, and there really should be no need to buy separate books online for reading practice for quite a while. There is an Appendix titled\"Standardization of Grammatical Participles\"which is particularly helpful. And following that is an Interlingua-English Glossary with the 3248 most frequently used words. And after that is it's counterpart\"English to Interlingua\"Glossary. The book is thick and there is a lot of information crammed into every page. It is a serious read, and somewhat academic.

This novel has so much to offer. It tells the story of the relatively unknown Winthrop family-specifically Elizabeth Winthrop. The novel is long but you'll find yourself wanting even more at the end. Seton takes her time, describing the girl's life growing up in England, her voyage across seas to a new land, and her adult life in Massachusetts and Connecticut. It is a fascinating story and once again, Seton does an immense amount of research that makes the novel even more enjoyable to read. I certainly recommend it for anyone from the New England area, as the Winthrops were quite a prominent family in the 17th century.

Imagine healing from the atrocities of war without punishment, prisons, or revenge. Imagine demonstrating a new way of being, based on the strength and wholeness of individuals and communities. Imagine working with impoverished villages devastated by war and Ebola, where those remaining are not seen as victims, but are seen as creative leaders with the power to rebuild their devastated communities. This book describes a journey of healing for the author and the leaders of the Fambol Tok movement, and how together they rebuilt Sierra Leone, village by village. As the story progresses, the villages heal and transform, and the author and her partners also transform in some beautiful ways. The book gets a bit ramble in places, but delivers a powerful message. It shows us what humans are capable of, when given the opportunity to organize themselves for the common good. It shows that traditional humanitarian aid, no matter how well intentioned, often prevents communities from organizing and getting what they truly need. Readers will find new ways of looking at the world, and great hope for humanity in this unique and highly engaging book.","symbols":""},{"label":-1,"rating":2.0,"title":"disappointing let down","text":"disappointing let down.

Anyone who knows history knows that the North Vietnamese attacked American where it would hurt most, that is, the court of public opinion back home.

But Elsa remains a mystery-a wispy shadow whose character isn't as well developed. Frank and Elsa's romance blossoms, but then it's cut short when the young couple gets a little too close. They both kicked out of the hospital. That's when things go sideways in the story. It's not that the ending was disappointing-that's life-I just wasn't sure if things made much sense.

It was a real struggle for me to finish the last 40 pages or so, because I just didn't care anymore. Overall, it reads like a lukewarm rehash of Ludlum's earlier and much better book AQUITAINE PROGRESSION. The problem as I see it, is that the Ludlum of today no longer connects the twists and turns to the story.

Well, typically most geometry self-teachning books focus on the topics typically covered in a high school geometry class, which I might add are quite simplistic in nature. I skimmed through this book at my local bookstore out of curious it I've had good luck with the demystified series, especially physics, by the same author, and what really caught my attention was the coverage of the elementary high school topics in a lean, mean six chapters with the rest covering hyperspace, warped space, polar coordinates, and basic vector mathematics. The quizzes are pretty good for reinforcing the concepts. they actually make you think gee, what a concept! It'd be nice if there were more of the problems, however but not as many as Glencoe's books do. The tests really give one a sense of being in a classroom, especially since there's a final exam as well. This book is a gem, and for 13, you can't really go wrong.","symbols":"$"},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"Good window on qualities in giant schnauzers","text":"Good window on qualities in giant schnauzers.

But, once she got to Morocco, the story really turned around for me. The author did a great job of depicting the country, and I felt that I was there with Sidonie. The characters were interesting and well developed. From a travel standpoint, it was great the very atmospheric back alleys of Marrakesh in 1930 and the landscape beyond the cities, with the nomadic Tuaregs. But it was also fascinating to watch Sidonie's development from a sheltered, repressed individual to one with growing confidence and a real sense of being where she was meant to be.

In truth, this is an excellent book that is weighted down with its quasi-academic style. On the whole, the ideas presented are not new in terms of the real world, but may be new to the reader. The book is a slow slog because of the language, but worthwhile overall for someone seeking insight into using diagrams to resolve systemic issues.

If your own real parents were terrible, the place to work that out is in the therapist's office or in long boozy conversations with friends, that sort of thing, but there's no good reason to import your childhood miseries into your imaginary omnipotent protector's character.

They went from escaping HON to going back the very next day? And to make matters worse. Erik turns into a complete jerk, and Heath comes back and is imprinted with Z again? ! The only good part of the whole novel was the last few chapters. Although I found the ending to be quite upsetting since they didn't tell you anymore about Z and the gang. I really hope Tempted gets back on track with the other four, and that Hunted was just an in between book to make readers happy that they didn't have to wait so long.

The author presents very well the readings and writings about the war in the 50 years that followed it, and about the underlying social factors and desires that made reconciliation along with true racial equality either impossible or simply unattained.

But this book takes 275 pages before it gets to editing a single frame and I found that for most answers I needed to turn to the manual anyway. Also the book doesn't address any of the other programs that come with Final Cut Studio and almost treats them like they don't exist for instance for DVD authoring it tells you to use iDVD when the much more powerful DVD Studio Pro is included with your Final Cut software.

You have to draw family charts way into the past, with as much info as you can find out about your direct descendants.

I have nothing against the author, I just think there should have been more information given.","symbols":""},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Just ok, could have been a lot better. 2. 5-3 stars","text":"Just ok, could have been a lot better. 2. 5-3 stars. Actress extraordinaire Gabrielle Union wrote a story about her life, her loves, her struggles and her triumphs. She tackled every issue from teenage sex, rape, drugs, racism, the music industry to her struggle with infertility. The format is appealing, as a conversational prose, like she was having a conversation with a friend. While I thought her thoughts on race were interesting, some of the things that I thought she really could have talked more about were glossed over. Granted, I know that her rape at a Payless Shoe store when she was a teen was difficult, I expected her to mention more than she did. She briefly mentioning the settlement i. e. , money, and towards the end mentioned meeting with women who were also victims. I think I would have liked it more had she really discussed that versus some of the other stuff she rambled about. So if you are asking yourself, why only 2. 5 to 3 stars, it was because I did like\"some\"parts of her discussion regarding being a step parent and her attempts at balancing a family and work.","symbols":""},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Not it!","text":"Not it!. I was looking for more of an in-depth look at how to set up a trucking company. This book only gives a very generalized look at things. It also switches back and forth between starting a trucking company and picking a trucking company.

I've never had a seller tell me that CD's like this were GOOD condition so I'm really bummed that I can't give the reseller a bad review. Kyle Mills is a great writer and that is the ONLY reason i gave the review 3 stars.","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"Refreshing, light read.","text":"Refreshing, light read.. Mr Lynch's Holiday is the story of widower Dermot, a retired Irish bus driver who hails Birmingham who makes an unexpected visit to his son Eamonn who now lives in Spain. Dermot is unaware that Eamonn is severely depressed following the departure of his girlfriend who has returned to the UK. Eamonn is living in Lomaverde, a remote, half-finished ghost estate, where a handful of other expats are struggling to put a brave face on a financial disaster. Many of the unoccupied houses are unfinished, electric cables are exposed on unfinished roads and squatters have moved in. While Dermot expects a relaxing two week holiday, he finds himself dealing with his son's depression and self destructive actions. The strongest parts of the novel are Dermot's memories and the interactions between the expats who try to organize the estate and some social interactions. Unfortunately the character of Eamonn is over-the-top. He's a walking disaster who careens from one faux pas to another, but in spite of its flaws I enjoyed the book for its refreshing, optimistic tone. I'd say that this is basically a light read, but very well done in spite of its weaknesses and slightly annoying, too-pat ending.","symbols":""},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Josefina's Cook Book","text":"Josefina's Cook Book.

I was fairly impressed by many of the subtle messages in volume one of the series, but this installment albeit containing a few scattered gems has degenerated into the angst-, cloche-, and puppy love-filled perspective of a less-enlightened character who, over the course of 300-odd pages, becomes extremely irksome. The constant repetition of his waking-state go-to's completely overwhelms and obscures any metaphysical truths that crop up much more sparsely than in the previous. To be honest, I bought the whole series on the recommendation of a friend, and now I have definite reservations about continuing. At the least I've had to shift to some different books to create a bit of a breather. After an entire volume of constant clinches plus the author's tendency to use the word'I'in place of the grammatically correct'me, I was not exactly smiling like a filo ste r ops.","symbols":"~~"},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"An ugly portrayal of Scotland","text":"An ugly portrayal of Scotland.

Aside from that I guess the other things might be okay, but I didn't feel like reading anymore to find out. The print was smaller than I would have liked.

There are tons of tutorial books on travel photography out there. You're probably asking should you buy this one instead of one of the others? Based on my experience, I would say no. The biggest problem is that the example photos are not very inspirational. Few of the photos are of recognizable landmarks, so you cannot easily compare his ideas with photos you have taken in the past. Most of the photos could be taken anywhere, which is not my idea of\"travel\"photography. I prefer travel photos that highlight unique locations. Further, the printing quality is kind of dull compared to real printed photos, which is not very encouraging. The text of the book does have some useful information on travel photography, but without inspirational photos to back up his ideas, I lost interest quickly.","symbols":""},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"How many lies does the Government keep","text":"How many lies does the Government keep.

The main character Ivy is a very loveable young girl and you want her to survive and prosper. As bad as the program was I am sure there were good social workers out there who really thought they were helping these impoverish communities. While I think it is barbaric that this sterilization went on and the rest of the country had no idea, it does make me wonder\"What other secrets are out there that our Government is keeping from us\".
