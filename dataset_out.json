After their first manager, Brian Epstein, died, they needed a new manager and how. Their finances were in a mess and none of them had any idea how to deal with money. At least the Rolling Stones had grown up in middle class families and Mick Jagger had even attended the London School of Economics for a year, so they were a tiny bit less unprepared for sudden wealth. Allen Klein, a New York accountant who had made a career representing American singers such as Sam Cooke and Bobby Vinton, was extremely ambitious and convinced the Stones that he'd get them more money, lots of it. He followed through, so the Beatles were interested. Paul McCartney was wary though, and with good reason. Klein was an operator and while he did get more money for his clients, he made sure he did all right too. Somehow he had ended up with the rights to all of Sam Cooke's songs and made questionable tax shelters for his clients.<br \/><br \/>Author Fred Goodman goes into great detail about the angles Klein was playing and sometimes it gets a bit convoluted, but that's the way Klein liked it. Lots of celebrities and gossip here, but mostly business ins and outs and to be honest, I had to skim it in places just to get through. Nice look at a different take on The Beatles though, and no one comes out of it looking good."},{"label":1,"rating":4.0,"title":"Great","text":"It would be helpful if anything happens to my car."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Could not put it down!","text":"This was a great read -- strong, real characters moving through the intrigue of our recent history.

I don't imagine things are much different now. Our protagonist, although he has a degree from Harvard, has fallen on hard times. Maybe through his own error. Does it matter? There is a random element to life. His family does not even own a car. There is nothing romantic about poverty.<br \/>Our protagonist begins to contemplate what he is willing to do to improve his circumstances. The early 60's were a time of relative prosperity, and he has somehow fallen behind. He sees others engaging in bad behaviors with relative impunity.<br \/>At some point the book becomes meandering and quite difficult to follow. I would not describe it as a pleasant read. Everybody in town has some kind of sordid secret which comes to light. I imagine that is the point.<br \/>I read it twice, maybe 10 years apart, and both times felt like I had missed something.<br \/>Life is full of dark things.

Make way and make time for these stories.  While I have read his two previous novels of Hollywood Cowboys and Kiss of the Traitor, his writing style demanded my attention to explore this short story compilation.  This series of shorts follows a universe set in motion by a character named John Wayfinder who puts the reader in the near and far futures of humanity following an alien event.  Nearly all of the stories overlap in some branched way and somehow are all connected into exploring a unique idea of becoming \"unstuck\" in the universe; a premise that a single person can move forward and backward through time along a created universe, to recruit an unlikely team to rid the timeline of his own mistake.  A genuinely fun and light-hearted sci-fi read, there are moments where action takes over logic and launches us readers into a void where we question motive over moral.  A solid read throughout.

Angeline Boulley's Firekeeper's Daughter is a fantastic debut.<br \/><br \/>But if you only talk about it as a YA thriller, you\u2019re missing half the book. That\u2019s just the plot. Yes,  Daunis is an 18-year old biracial Anishinaabe woman gets who pulled into an FBI investigation into the drug trade in her community and falls for the new guy on her brother\u2019s hockey team. She\u2019s a solid hockey player in her own right and a science nerd.<br \/><br \/>But within that story, Angeline Boulley's debut paints a vivid picture of what it is to be a biracial Native American woman. With Daunis, we get a clear sense of how her Anishinaabe culture, traditions, and community ground her daily life; how she balances and code switches between her white and Nish families; and how she's torn between heading to college, but knowing she has a responsibility to her family and community. As a biracial person, it\u2019s incredibly relatable.<br \/><br \/>A fast-paced thriller and a thoughtful coming of age story, Firekeeper's Daughter is a love letter to Anishinaabe traditions and the power of community. But in it, Boulley also lays bare the long-term impacts of colonization; racism and bigotry; politics within indigenous communities; the way the federal government\u2019s actions have contributed to corruption and the meth epidemic, and relegated indigenous communities, especially their women, to second, even third-class citizen status.<br \/><br \/>FIrekeeper's Daughter is powerful and candid with rich characters and a compelling case to unravel. I can't wait to see Daunis brought to life on Netflix.<br \/><br \/>It\u2019s YA, but it\u2019s definitely for older teens.<br \/><br \/>CW: Sexual assault, gun violence, murder, grief, drug trafficking<br \/><br \/>I received an advance reader copy from the publisher and purchased my own from an indie bookstore."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"It\u2019s amazing","text":"I love this book it every different from the little mermaid we know but still I love it"},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Five Stars","text":"Perfect."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Fun to build models in the book","text":"This book was fun.

They occasionally cross paths, but she always avoids him. Determined, Scott sets out to make Alexis his, once and for all.<br \/><br \/>I really wanted to like this book. I enjoyed the first book in the Megalodon Team series and hoped this one would be as good if not better. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. I found Alexis to be frustrating, childish and annoying. The one bright spot in the book was Scott. He was so loving, passionate, protective and all around great. With all of those wonderful attributes, Alexis just refused to believe that Scott loved her, wanted to be with her AND was only interested in her. It was okay for her to hear bits and pieces of conversations and jump to conclusions, but the one moment he did, it was a catastrophic event with her storming away and leaving him to berate himself.<br \/><br \/>So often throughout this book, I hoped Scott would just stop pursuing Alexis and find a woman who wasn't so fickle and flighty; one who could actually return his feelings without a bunch of games and back and forth struggle. I understood that their jobs within the Navy and their rankings were an issue, but Alexis took it to the extreme. I wanted to scream when she would continue to address Scott as 'Commander' even though he practically begged her to call him by his first name. I took that as a way for her to not only put up a wall, but also as an unnecessary show of power over him to let him know that she wasn't going to succumb to his affections.<br \/><br \/>I will try to read the next book in the series. Hopefully it will be better, but I already sense a pattern with these books - SEAL falls madly in love with woman, woman rebuffs his advances, man refuses to stop, woman gives in and develops feelings, woman hears tail end of a conversation and thinks man is in love with another woman, and man has to regain her trust and love.

Some of the actors and places she referred to were familiar to me. I thought her writing style was excellent and she showed how she loved passionately her fellow actors and friends.

I find it useful not only in helping me with the teens that I teach, but also at work in understanding the various mindsets that I encounter - especially in this day of near constant change in the workplace. In the classroom, it helped me to think of types of experiential learning exercises for the teens to help them learn how to deal with their emotions, drives, and impulses. A mix of competative \"Red\" and \"Orange\" activities to get the idea that competition has a destructive side, followed by more \"Green\" cooperative activities to show how it solves so many problems. With so many of the teens now concerned about the environment and war, activities that highlight the Orange\/GREEN transition has been key to their classroom experience. It has also helped at work in understanding why certain types of project management schemes (such as the popular SCRUM method) failed to work in our Blue\/ORANGE company environment."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"All 60 Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle in just 2 volumes? Can it be true?","text":"Let me guess, you want to get into Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes works - but you do not know where to start?<br \/><br \/>You recognize \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" the most but realize it was written after a number of Holmes stories.... You do not want to start at the beginning because there are other more well-known Holmes stories you would like to get acquainted with first.... You have heard about the large number of Sherlock Holmes short stories and do not know which one to start with....<br \/><br \/>Elementary, my dear reader - there is a simple solution to your dilemma: The Complete Sherlock Holmes: All 4 Novels and 56 Short Stories.<br \/><br \/>You honestly cannot find a better deal than this: all 4 novels and 56 short stories featuring Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in 2 chronological volumes for around $10.00. It is unbelievable - astounding, even!<br \/><br \/>Arthur Conan Doyle is one of my favorite authors - and his Sherlock Holmes character (although Doyle himself would bore of the character and long for an end to writing about him) is one of my personal favorite characters of literature. Doyle's stories are suspenseful, funny, all-out entertaining and, of course, phenomenally written - the character of Sherlock Holmes is one of the most complex and fun to follow protagonists in the history of known literature.<br \/><br \/>Unless you are a collector, there is no reason to try to assemble the works of Arthur Conan Doyle individually, piece by piece, when The Complete Sherlock Holmes offers you every story in two volumes for such a low price."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Great Book! 6th Sense+The Skulls+The Tale of the Body Thief!","text":"Will Clarke is such a great author, he reminds me of Anne Rice because you are sucked in and have no idea what is going on around you while you read. This book is so interesting because it is told from the viewpoint of a ghost, but instead of the typical nice naive person who is randomly murdered ghost (Lovely Bones, Dead like me) this is your stereotypical fraternity boy. The frat boy perspective gives it a fresh viewpoint and makes it really relatable because this guy is so normal and not perfect and not all harmonious & pious after death. Like Lord Vishnu, you have no idea where this book is going to go and you can't put the book down. I also liked learning about the inner workings of fraternity rituals which I've always wondered about, hence The Skulls reference above.  You can't go wrong with a Will Clarke book and here you have ghost stories, plus the college experience, plus great flushed out characters.

The first section tells you about the poses themselves with pictures to go along. It also gives you the options for the modified positions, which is helpful.  After that, you will find images of those same positions, however these images show the musculoskeletal system. It shows you exactly which muscles you are supposed to be working while completing these poses. That part was awesome, there are poses that I can do very well, but that's sometimes because I don't know what I'm actually supposed to focus on, for example, I may be using back strength instead of core strength.

It isn\u2019t that I disagree at all, but I come here to escape and immerse myself in a story, I do not need to be nagged to be a decent person.

This book started with Elizabeth Lyons finding her boyfriend cheating on her with her roommate at the time.

Fast forward eight years and Elizabeth is still a hardworking female, and she has made a name for herself in the production business which for females is hard including a young one like herself. She is awarded the honor of being one of the Thirty under thirty to look out for and heads to a party where she meets Daniel Alexander.

I felt truly sorry for her father (diminished more by her portrayal than by the shooter's action), and for her new husband, who kept a record indicating one out of four days in their new marriage was 'insufferable and intolerable.' (Her actions even made me feel sorry for Netanyahu!)<br \/><br \/>Yet Laura plowed on -- oblivious to anyone else's needs or discomfort, deceiving and constantly manipulating people, cooly describing and then rationalizing her behavior, and scrutinizing her own tiresome emotional navel. Self-display is not the same thing as honesty or insight.<br \/><br \/>Many reviewers are entranced by her writing -- and she has a really fine eye for telling detail, and at times turns a remarkable, poetic phrase -- but too often I found her writing felt forced, overwrought, or repetitive.<br \/><br \/>Not really a book I can recommend."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"A solid review of Hill's \"Tender\" from the Bay Area ...","text":"A solid review of Hill's \"Tender\" from the Bay Area Reporter's Jim Piechota...<br \/><br \/>\"Hill's experiences are leavened by the bracing, slam-poetry delivery of his writing style\u2026.<br \/>With unfettered honesty and graphic delivery, Hill's memoir commands attention.\"<br \/><br \/>[...]"},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Five Stars","text":"grand son loves it"},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Good book, but","text":"What a fantastic book !!!

Although I love reading them, a cookbook has to be not only beautiful, interesting and unique, it has to be useful for real people, real home cooks (like me) in real kitchens, feeding real families and friends. On all accounts, this beautiful book from accomplished chef and food writer Rozanne Gold is a winner.<br \/><br \/>First things first, the book itself--and this is so important for a cookbook--is easy to read and use. The binding is high quality and the typeface and layout are easy and comfortable to read, and there are beautiful photos for almost every recipe. The book will lie open flat so you can cook from it without fumbling.<br \/><br \/>The recipes are wonderful--innovative without that tedious \"I'm trying too hard here to come up with something new and different!\" feeling in so many newer cookbooks. The recipes are geared toward quick preparation (15 minutes, 30 minutes) using fresh and simple whole foods, and even a few simple convenience foods, like canned beans and chickpeas, frozen peas and Dijon mustard. Fabulous.<br \/><br \/>I cannot wait to try: \"Almost Confit\" Chicken with Melted Garlic, Pork Chops and Apples with Madeira-Bay Butter Sauce, A New Way to Cook Broccoli: Charred & Tossed With Chilies and Garlic, Spiced Salmon on a Moroccan Salad...oh, heck, I think I may just start at \"Bloody\" Shrimp Cocktail and work my through to Double Raspberry Sorbet.<br \/><br \/>Recommendation: Excellent addition to a home cook's bookshelf."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Great visit back to 90's culture.","text":"I enjoy this book more every day.

It's definitely not a feel good novel, though it does have its heartwarming moments. Most of it is bleak and raw. I'm happy to discover what I think is a very talented author and look forward to reading more of her work.<br \/>Many years ago, Susan's little brother died while in her care. The guilt from his death continues to rule her life even when she has her own little boy to mother. Shockingly, the tragedy happened when she was only seven and her little brother almost five. A seven year old shouldn't even be left alone to care for themselves, let alone for another. Who is to blame, the child who took mothers pills? The slightly older sister watching him? Or the parents, the father who was working and left them in the care of the unstable mother who left her children alone to go out with another man? Little Mark was the clear favorite child of them both and with him gone, Susan suffers even more than she had before.  When she's grown and has a child of her own, she fears she'll hurt him and is too anxious to mother him in most any way. If she can't face her demons, she'll lose everything.<br \/>I love books that just seem to flow. You don't want to put them down even if you're uncomfortable, you don't get confused by the characters or distracted from the story. This book flows and I read it all at once.

Insane? Maybe. Really, the only way to describe Remic's Kell's Legend is with a phrase: a bloody, violent, fantastic journey through carnage, terror, and a downright epic tale that makes Underworld and every zombie movie look bad. That sounds about right.<br \/><br \/>Kell's Legend is the first is Remic's Clockwork Vampire Chronicles. It follows Kell, a legendary warrior who has grown old, and a number of other characters, from his granddaughter Nienna to Anukis, a clockwork vampire-turned-exile in her own homeland. When strange, twisted albino soldiers descend upon the city of Jalder, Kell must take up his axe once again to defend his family. But with that action comes a flood of memories hinting at his dark past, at the Kell nobody remembers or everyone chooses to forget...<br \/><br \/>Remic certainly managed a tour de force with Kell's Legend. I've never read anything quite so unapologetic about its violence, but also brilliant in its brute force. Kell's Legend is rough, for sure; at the same time, however, it's entertaining and powerful, taking all that is wonderful about truly epic, adventurous fantasy and twisting it like Quentin Tarantino twists the movies. Remic is the Tarantino of fantasy (and science fiction, I presume), and if that isn't a compliment, then I don't know what is.<br \/><br \/>Kell's Legend isn't just about action and brilliantly detailed fights. It's packed full of amazing dialogue (and some clever witty banter to boot), and the characters are three-dimensional, something I think many fantasy writers of the more action-packed vein (including myself) have issue with. Remic has managed to put together a tale that pushes the boundaries while maintaining the necessary elements of a good fantasy novel (interesting characters, gripping conflicts, etc.).<br \/><br \/>There were only two problems I had with Kell's Legend:<br \/>1) Sometimes the action can be a bit much. For the most part it's entertaining and propels the plot, but sometimes it feels overbearing; there aren't a lot of breaks.<br \/>2) The language is outside of my comfort zone in one scene (and only one, as far as I can recall). If his language had kept in that vein for more than one chapter, then I would have tossed the book at the wall, but, thankfully, that is not what happened. However, if you cannot stand foul language in any form, this is not the book for you.<br \/><br \/>Both of these problems are personal preferences and not indicative of any significant fault of the novel or Remic. If you aren't bothered by these things, then this is definitely a book for you. If you're already a Remic fan, then you'll love Kell's Legend.<br \/><br \/>I look forward to the second book in the series. I'd love to know what happens with the Clockwork Vampires, Kell, his granddaughter, and some of the other characters."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Awesome book to start my journey","text":"Great book!"},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Great review book","text":"Extremely good - using for usmle step 1 review.<br \/>Great tables and easy to read."},{"label":1,"rating":4.0,"title":"Four Stars","text":"Enjoyed reading."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Review of Songwriter Deluxe by Fan & Friend","text":"In the mid 90s Ricky Roberts tried to make a revival of his R&R career with his &#34;An Evening with the Composer &#34; tour.

Using real events as a basis for part of the story, Iles demonstrates sheer genius in his ability to capture the reader's attention and hold it throughout the book as though he is reporting on non-fictional occurrences, complete with real people (many of whom are known to the reader).  My one frustration was related to the introduction of so many names that I sometimes got lost as to who they were and had to flip backwards in the book to remind myself.

Civilians, under the rules of war, are forbidden to attack military personnel, doing so subjects you to legal reprisals. The civil population was aroused by priests and politicians to attack German soldiers by sniping.

In a clever and original premise, the narrator, a psyciatric resident at UCLA Medical Center, inadvertently inspires a patient to invent a web application that turns out to be a popular, wiki-like source of religious wisdom, called TOAD.<br \/><br \/>The book is populated with a dozen or so interesting characters, and kept my interest all the way through. The main thrust of the story, however, is not TOAD. The first half of the book reads like an autobiography, focusing mainly on the narrator's ambivalence about his own career. Only in the second half of the book does an actual plot develop, involving chicanery within the political and professional world of psychiatry. Structured more like a mystery yarn, the intrigue of the second half succeeded at drawing me in to the conclusion.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately the book missed some interesting possibilities in exploring the \"wisdom\" of TOAD and the narrator's relation to it. Despite being seen as the project's inspiration, the narrator remains aloof from it, surprised that anyone is taking it seriously. We're told that TOAD enjoys legions of users who genuinely benefit from the program. It might have been fun if the narrator learned something from it, or an equally interesting possibility, learned to disagree with its teachings and became a heretic to his own following.<br \/><br \/>Still in all, a good read told with inventiveness and humor, and lots to chew on."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Superb!

Did you also know that I live about an hour away from there? Crazy! I could just relate to this book so much. What Alecia Whitaker wrote was so relatable and so true for this area of the country.<br \/><br \/>The story is about an all country farm girl Ricki Jo, but please call her Ericka if she is at school. She is fourteen years old, lives on her father's farm, and her best friend Luke Foster lives just right down the street. This coming of age novel talks about all the things a girl wants to happen once she enters High School. Ricki Jo wants to be popular and fit in with the cool crowd, but can she still be herself and not change to fit in with the popular crowd?<br \/><br \/>I just loved this book so much! I could relate so much to Ricki Jo at parts in the book. My dad was also a Tabaco farmer, but quite once there was a big buy out which is just what Ricki Jo's dad did also. I live on a farm with cattle, crops, and barns. So I just got really into the story. Ricki Jo lived in a town that isn't too different from mine. The author uses a lot of references that I could understand.<br \/><br \/>I also really enjoyed the characters. Ricki Jo is friends with a bunch of mean girls, but at the end you really see redeeming qualities in them all. My favorite character was Luke and he really held the book together at times. While there relationship was perdictable, I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen with them in the end. I am glad that Ricki Jo's friend Mackenzie turned out to be a true friend. I really liked her at the beginning and thought that she was nice to Ricki Jo when the other girls weren't.<br \/><br \/>Ricki Jo is relatable to me because there have been a lot of times that I have been in the same position as her. I never really fit in at my high school and I remember putting up with mean comments, just to say that I have friends. But I never had as good as friend as Luke. Ricki Jo is lucky! I also loved all her funny commentary; there were parts when I was laughing out loud.<br \/><br \/>I also just got to say I love Kentucky! It is so beautiful and I love how the author you a lot of descriptive language to describe their farm and how farm life was.<br \/><br \/>Overall, The Queen of Kentucky has a very good message that I think everybody should take the time to read. I would recommend this to any girl that is in middle school. I really enjoyed it and glad that I had it down in my 2012 Debut Author Challenge. I really wish that the author would write another one.

For me, the best scene in the story took place on the evening when Buddy and Gracie joined Beatrice and the judge for dinner. I would have loved to have heard Gracie as she prayed before their dinner. Some books have a faint spiritual undercurrent with an over-abundance of romance, action, and suspense. I appreciated the manner in which Gracie was able to just be herself and let her inner beauty shine out to light up the world around her. Unlike many who try to force their beliefs on others, she had a way of living her beliefs in such a way that people gravitated to her and trusted her with their deepest concerns.

Also the pages are so thin you can see through them, and I don't mean barely see through them, you can read the words on the next page. The paper quality is literally comparable to some bibles and if you take any notes with pens\/highlighters they will bleed through.<br \/><br \/>Content wise I like the pictures more in this book than in my copy of Robbins, but the way it is organized and with how thin the pages are it is hard to justify using it instead."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"How can you go wrong with Dr. Seuss?","text":"We have bought about ~20 Dr. Seuss books thus far.

The characters and humor popped off the page, and the setting was a vivid recollection of the city (which I especially appreciated because I grew up in New York). But the book is not just a portrait of Manhattan, it's Rosenthal's portrait of Manhattan. It's about her relationship with the city (and with being young and insecure and inspired and in search of one's identity IN the city). I think this is one reason why the title spells the city's name incorrectly - because this Manhattan is a private Manhatten, a skewed Manhatten. I loved this aspect of it, this searching for your footing in the big city that is only just a symbol or microcosm of the big world. I certainly had my own private relationship with Manhattan as a young adult, and this brought me back to that time of uncertainty, excitement, and the sense that everything simultaneously hangs in the balance and lies up ahead."},{"label":0,"rating":5.0,"title":"Perfect condition.

The accounts come from the very poor in Colombia.  To that end, most of the voices are female.  Journalist Constanza Ardila Galvis does an outstanding job of capturing the views of the poor in the Colombian countryside.  However, she is guilty on two counts.  One...the views are overwhelmingly pro-guerrilla and secondly her prose is too melodramatic.  Nevertheless, this is an important book that documents the suffering of the rural and urban poor war inside Colombia.  Two quotes stuck in my mind when I finished this book.  The first was by Laura who said,\"the hatred against those who persecute and murder us kept me in the struggle.\"  And Angela who said, \"I continue to be convinced we must keep dying, giving birth and bringing up soldiers for the revolution.\"  On a positive note, all the voices in this book conclude that a non-violent and just solutions must be sought in Colombia.

I just recently had the pleasure of meeting Virginia McKevitt at a book signing function in New Orleans.  I hadn\u2019t heard of her as an Author and was not familiar with her work.  I read all types but heavy into the paranormal, erotic, sci fi and contemporary romance.  None of which really are YA or NA.  I picked up both the books at the signing and promised Virginia I would read them.  Well since I hadn\u2019t brought my kindle with me I decided to start the first book.  I was a little tired and didn\u2019t get far along.  I didn\u2019t have the chance to pick it back up until I got back from New Orleans.<br \/><br \/>When I started reading I\u2019ll be honest I wasn\u2019t sure if this was something for me, I realize the first few chapters most authors set up the characters so it might be a tad slow, once we got past the formalities of the characters (BTW the set up was actually very interesting.  Good back ground info for later in the read), the read took off.  OMG I so wasn\u2019t expecting that.<br \/><br \/>Kristina based on all accounts is one feisty, strong willed, strong headed no nonsense young lady.  When her parents were murdered she didn\u2019t crumble and fall apart, now don\u2019t get me wrong, yes she was devastated, but she was out to seek revenge.  She wanted to see whoever did this dead. Kristina was what we might call a half breed. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying on this subject. In comes Tegrin Guardian\/Assassin and the King\u2019s right hand man. Tegrin was sent on a mission by his King to dispose of the Couton (A clan of Women who feed off others emotions) who had found the opening between the two worlds.  They wanted out from under the King to do as they pleased.  On top of the pleasure they experienced from feeding on the memories of the humans they were experiencing other emotions and it became an addiction.  In the small town of Blessings the bodies were piling up and Tegrin was sent to stop them. It\u2019s in Kristina\u2019s home Tegrin meets his destiny \u201cKristina\u201d (grant it he doesn\u2019t know that yet).  Tegrin was to get in and out and not let any humans see him.  That didn\u2019t work out so well. He ends up allying with Kristina\u2019s two friends Sissy and Jimmy and of course Sissy\u2019s dog Bo a retired CIA operative in order to stop the Couton.  So much for humans not finding out.<br \/><br \/>There was a lot unknown about Kristina and we do find out what she is.  The story played out perfectly.  From the tattoo appearing after her first kill, to her warrior like instincts. What happens when she finds her real Dad\u2019s military foot locker left to her when he died, to her going to Potwain with Tegrin to meet her Grandfather and be trained as a guardian and taught how to use her powers.  She\u2019s the best of both worlds.<br \/><br \/>There is a little touch of humor, for example when Tegrin brings Ahmor (a Guardian) to train and fight with Kristina (because he can\u2019t be around her) and she breaks his nose. My favorite was when Kristina smacked Maketi\u2019s nose (Tegrins Stallion).  Now you have to understand everyone feared Tegrin but they feared his horse also.  She had those two spinning.  She showed absolutely no fear.  As in all good reads there is a sad part but you\u2019ll need to read for yourself I don\u2019t want to give too many spoilers.  Hmmmm but I\u2019m going to give one now Tegrin and Kristina do the deed. YES.  The stone cold hearted Assassin who has no emotions fell for our girl.  Everyone saw it.  The King, her grandfather everyone.  I loved it.  Now I can\u2019t wait to jump into \u201cThe Hunted\u201d Kudos Virginia I really did love it."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Beautiful and very flattering","text":"Beautiful and very flattering!

And hour later, I was so caught up in the story that I read the whole thing. Dinner was late. It was worth it.<br \/><br \/>Girl at the End of the World is a memoir by Elizabeth Esther,  a woman who grew up in a fundamentalist branch of Christianity founded by her grandfather.  It\u2019s essentially the story of what happens when enthusiastic followers of Jesus (her grandparents were influenced by the Jesus Movement) slowly shift from the faith that drew them in and get wrapped up in rules and behavioral codes and the strict dictates of one charismatic, unaccountable leader.<br \/><br \/>The storytelling here is so good. The author masterfully shares the scenes of her childhood without bitterness \u2013 towards God, faith, or her family. It\u2019s impressive, and the book is one of the best I\u2019ve read in this genre.  I was surprised by how relatable this story is. I grew up as far away from a faith based cult as one can imagine, and yet I feel like I want to sit down with the author, pour a glass of wine, and talk about the amazing ways God works in our lives. She really succeeds in making readers feel like friends.<br \/><br \/>The story is divided into three sections: her childhood, her experience breaking out and trying to navigate mainstream culture, and then her process of figuring out a new way to engage with God outside of her strict, abusive upbringing. I loved it all. Her descriptions of her childhood are so vivid, I felt like I was right there (which was difficult at times \u2013 there are some tough moments).  Her take on first encountering Oprah Winfrey\u2019s show and how quickly television commercials stirred up a dissatisfaction with her life she\u2019d never felt before is a great reminder of how much we\u2019re being manipulated by what we watch.

Though their target was another age group, I noticed that, if you looked close enough, the situations, comments, etc., portrayed in the books hinted at a world of values that had permeated the fantasy story without burdening it without need. Afterwards, I read The Casual Vacancy and was confirmed in my theory. Now, with the first Cormoran Strike book, I was once again confirmed that, quite apart from the HP books, JKR is a writer on her own right. Come to think of it, the HP books are also a kind of whodunnit ....

This funny, strange, and haunting graphic novel explores our relationship with art (as both creators and consumers) through deceptively simple pen and ink drawings. In fact, I think that simplicity is important to its charm-- the cartoonish portrayal of the characters makes them feel vulnerable and innocent, which lends a sense of humanity to the abstract narrative.

I guess I've been let down so many times by poorly conceived, blandly written and inadequately edited books that I assumed 'She Does Not Fear The Snow' would be more of the same. Not so.<br \/><br \/>Bobbie Ann Cole is an intelligent writer who has produced a perceptive and well written account of a significant life event. The heart of the book rests on three catalytic events: Cole's cancer diagnosis, her failed marriage and her examination of Hebrew and Christian faith.<br \/><br \/>In a form of pilgrimage Cole travels from England to Israel, Switzerland and Canada, along the way encountering remarkable people and events. Her guide and confidant is often Terry, an impish, intuitive, serendipitous lover of life who emerges from her log cabin in Canada to join Cole in mystical discovery. The  friendship leads to another person - a quiet, humorous man who engages Cole in ways that surprise her.<br \/><br \/>The romantic interludes may be of more interest to female readers but it is the stunning mysticism that intrigues me. Throughout Cole bravely approaches events that appear to supersede logic. Some are natural: an eagle flying beside her for miles on a frozen river, whitetail deer approaching fearlessly, the menacing, powerful appearance of a moose. And there are unexpected human events including the offering of a rug and its emergence as a map defining Cole's and Terry's natures and perhaps their futures.<br \/><br \/>'She Does Not Fear The Snow' examines suffering, searching, finding and the place of mystery in transforming lives.

I recently rewatched a couple of documentaries then the movie and I wanted to compare. There were a lot of inconsistencies across everything.  This book was clearly written for Azie for absolution and I hope he felt that he achieved that.<br \/><br \/>I will give credit where credit is due and I believe others should do the same.  I don't think Azie did that. It seemed to me the he was taking more credit than I felt was due to him with the influence him, Rich, and Alpo had on EVERYTHING,  but then, that's just me.  There was an excessive amount of name-dropping in the book as well, from DJs, rappers, and singers to actors and music producers. Was that really necessary? Azie<br \/>boasted about the flashy, customized cars with the sound systems and wearing customized jewelry to match the cars, the money, and the flashy clothes,  then turned right around and said something about keeping a low profile... yeah, no...<br \/><br \/>After watching the documentaries and the movie and reading the book, I have my thoughts and opinions about dude's role in the game and what would've happened hadn't certain other people not have gone to jail. It's his story though and he told it well enough.<br \/><br \/>I had higher hopes but the book just fell short. Maybe my expectations shouldn't have been so high?

Wish I could give it a five.","text":"Great story that really captured my attention. Two different plots that tangled together nicely with some unexpected twists. However, when reading the author's view on the have's and have not's in the world and how every one \"deserves\" things just because they exist, I immediately became turned off and will not read or recommend this author. Entitlement is a HUGE problem in our society. No one deserves anything. If a person wants to go to college, that's great. Take out student loans like I did. And pay them back, like I did and shut up about it. I didn't expect someone to give me a free education just because I exist. I worked damn hard for it. Then I got a job that offered excellent benefits so I had great health care. Before then, my parents covered my through their great jobs that they worked hard to earn benefits through. No one DESERVES anything just because they exist. There is no such thing as \"free.\"  If you, Daniel, want people educated and insured, who do think is going to pay for that? The rich, you say? Because they \"deserve\" it?  Unfortunately it will be me, the middle class paying, not the rich. I already pay for other people's health care, while I have my own, so I guess I should now pay for their education, too. If someone wants to go to college, pay for it -- student loans are available -- or don't go. It's that easy. Unfortunately, our esteemed President has made it impossible to go without insurance, even if you're a man and don't need prenatal care -- according to law, you still must carry it. But get a job and EARN the benefit instead of being a leach on society and thinking it's DESERVED. I really enjoyed the book, but you ruined it with your \"debt free, free health\" nonsense.

This is an enormously useful book that opens the expansive (and still rapidly expanding) world of APIs to PHP programmers like myself. His writing is meticulously clear, the examples work (or at least get you nine-tenths of the way there), and the chapters on actual APIs (PayPal, eBay, FedEx, Google, etc.) are useful. Of course, I'd have loved even more chapters on still other APIs (there are so many), but you'll probably learn enough about Web APIs from these examples to tackle any not covered. Easy download access to the source code is also appreciated.<br \/><br \/>I was personally less interested in the section on Web Feeds, but this is also well presented -- interestingly in context as a counterpart of Web APIs.<br \/><br \/>One final word: To get the most out of this book, you need to be an intermediate level PHP programmer.

JAMES BENDER PUBLISHING, 2011<br \/>HARDCOVER, $66.95, 320 PAGES, PHOTOGRAPHS, BIBLIOGRAPHY, ACRONYMS, TERMS<br \/><br \/>The 1930's proved to be a fertile time for demagogues and radical movements to appear in the United States, whether on the left or the right of the political spectrum. Huey Long combined populism with quasi-dictatorial rule in Louisiana while Father Charles R. Coughlin broadcast a popular national radio program blending religion, economics, and politics, lacing it with ever-increasing amounts of anti-Semitism. With mainstream strands of anti-Semitism, popularity of the KKK and worsening economic conditions in the Great Depression, German-American ultra-nationalism provided a voice for thousands in America. This was another side to the \"melting pot\" theory by demonstrating how two different traditions converged in the United States with immigrant families offering new ideas to their local communities. These ideas also united other groups, such as German fascists in Long Island holding rallies with Italian fascists under the American flag. Indeed, the United States didn't escape public displays supporting fascism and the terrain served as grounds for different groups to \"melt\" their ideology together.<br \/><br \/>The German-American Bund boasted in the late 1930s, that it had 250,000 members in 42 states-patriotic Americans all, dedicated to the democratic principles of the United States. Many of its leaders and members were sincere not only in their personal convictions but also in the best interests of their country-the United States. Yes, there were some who had negative attitudes towards Jews and other minorities but then so did the majority of Americans at that time. The author has unearthed that some Bund chapters had working relationships with Hispanic and other minority groups and even had some Jews as members. Yes, they flew the swastika because it was central to their racial identity.<br \/><br \/>Discovering how the local Bund blended fascism and democracy has been made difficult by local hesitations to revisit a negative chapter of the past. This is further compounded when people seek to hide history. One notable example was in 1995 when Suffolk County, New York legislators passed a resolution, sponsored by Herb David (R-Yaphank), \"for the removal of pro-Nazi references on the subdivision records\" from original documents. This proposed re-writing of history on the original records failed since it wasn't approved by the state government. Despite these obstacles, this new book, THEY TOO WERE AMERICANS: THE GERMAN-AMERICAN BUND IN WORDS, PHOTOS, AND ARTIFACTS sheds a whole new light on an often neglected part of local and national history in order to paint a more accurate view of history prior to the U.S. entry into World War II.<br \/><br \/>Author Scott Freeland skillfully uses primary documents to sketch a history of the Bundists as they might have viewed themselves as well as to be more understanding of the German-American Bund members place and time in the history of this country. His book (published by the well-known and respected R. James Bender) is a very detailed and well-written account with excellant photographs accompanying the text. As one reads this book, you are impressed with both the dedication and knowledge the author has managed to put together on a subject that has been not only overlooked but much misunderstood in our nation's history.<br \/><br \/>Lt.

His best hope of salvation is to trust Thuza, a ruby smuggler who offers to help him escape.<br \/><br \/>Beautiful and deeply scarred, Thuza has spent her entire life in a frontier town between rebel and government forces, never choosing a side but trying to make a living from both. For Thuza, the ambassador\u2019s son is her ticket out of poverty. For Than, an ambitious military officer, exploiting those caught in the war offers an opportunity for promotion and distinction.<br \/><br \/>But as all three learn to their cost, in this enigmatic and savage country, everyone has a price.<br \/><br \/>From the heart of Burma\u2019s exotic Rubyland comes an emotional thriller, as three lives are thrown together by the desperate choices they make to survive in a country gripped by civil war: a tale of ambition, salvation and hope that confirms Lucy Cruickshanks as a master storyteller.<br \/><br \/>Michael Atwood, the son of a British Ambassador in Burma goes missing and soon he realizes that he is caught in the war from both the sides and the power they holds on his capture is invaluable, that is when he needs to trust the only person who can help him to rescue from the grips of the rebels.<br \/><br \/>Thuza, the local Burmese girl, is a ruby smuggler, who knows her job well like the back of her hand, on how to differentiate ruby from the rocks, as it is the only salvation to buy her parents' freedom from the right officials.<br \/><br \/>Than, works and abides by the strict rules of the Tatmadaw army, is soon tested on his loyalty towards the Army, and he is forever desperate to climb the ladders of success by pleasing the General. Things change when he forces his son, Min, to join the forces and to take strict measures against those who wrong by the Armed Forces.<br \/><br \/>These three lives in Burma, now known as Myanmar, will break the hearts of the readers as their lives unfold and when their fate plays a major role to bring them together under dire circumstances.<br \/><br \/>The author has once again delivered a spectacular tale of love, freedom and loyalty towards one own government set against the back of another country from the far east- Burma, which harbors a difficult era in Burmese history, which not only torn apart the lives of the common man, but which made it impossible to survive under the dominance of the Tatmadaw army.<br \/><br \/>The author has evocatively captured the time frame as well as the location with her eloquent words. The background of Burma is dominated by lush and dense green forests and the tombs of the many Buddhist temples and that the author has vividly captured in her story line. The land where beauty of mother nature and repressive army plays a major role, is well painted into the canvas of the story as the author strikingly captures the culture, the local dialect and the grief of the citizens through her story. The author has done her research quite well with the ways how to find a ruby among the rocks, where to find it, and also the governance of the army and their torture among common people.<br \/><br \/>The author's writing style is spell-binding that I lost track of time as I devoured the novel in just one sitting. The book is highly addictive as articulate narrative shifts from one character to another. The pacing is really fast, despite the fact that the author has written the scenes descriptively, that made it easier for me to picture the events right in front of my eyes. The story is engrossing and kept me glued till the very end. The author has penned with so much deep, moving emotions and it definitely felt like she has poured all her best emotions into it.<br \/><br \/>The characters are drawn with realism and simplicity. The challenges thrown on their track made me rooting for them. All the three characters are inspiring and sad laced with grief and their demeanor is something to watch out for when they are caught in the politics and the war with the government and they are bound to leave an impression long after the end of this powerful historical fiction. The story has a complex and nostalgic ending that definitely moved me. The supporting characters are highly well-developed.<br \/><br \/>Overall the story is enthralling, thought-provoking and thoroughly gripping till the end set against the back drop of Burma in the late 20th century."},{"label":0,"rating":4.0,"title":"Great calendar, just small errors with names","text":"Fantastic calendar!!

The novel also presents a somewhat optimistic view of white  Southerners that was somewhat unusual at the time the novel appeared. The  story indicates there are good human beings like Atticus Finch everywhere,  even in the midst of a corrupt society. Even those who do wrong, the novel  goes on to suggest, often act out of ignorance and weakness rather than a  deliberate impulse to hurt others.<br \/>Another theme of the novel is the  transition from innocence to experience. At the beginning of the story  Scout's world is limited to the boundaries of her immediate neighborhood.  She feels safe and secure, and totally confident that the way things are  done in her home is not just the right way, but the only way. The arrival  of Dill, who comes from a broken home and has lived in another state, gives  Scout her first hint of a variety of experiences beyond her narrow  horizons. Then, on her first day of school, she begins to discover that not  everyone agrees that the way things are done in Maycomb, Alabama, is  necessarily correct. She also learns that sometimes it is necessary to  compromise in order to get along. Even though Scout's teacher's ideas about  how to teach reading may be wrong, Scout must respect the teacher's  authority. Her own father advises her to ignore the teacher's ban on  reading at home, but to pretend to go along with the teacher's methods  while in the classroom. This kind of social hypocrisy is new to Scout, and  she is surprised to hear her very moral father advocating it.<br \/>Related to  the theme of innocence and experience is the novel's suggestion that  innocent children can often see large moral issues more clearly than  adults. Scout, Jem, and Dill never waver in their horror at the injustice  done to Tom Robinson. The adults in the story, however, see all the  complexities of the situation to the point of being blinded to the central  issue of right and wrong. However much Scout may grow through her exposure  to new experiences, one hopes that she will never lose her childlike  undertaking of justice. In the view of this novel's author, justice is a  simple concept. To recognize the difference between justice and injustice  does not take any special degree of wisdom or sophistication. In fact, the  learned members of the community--such as the judge and prosecutor--and the  proudly religious Baptists who are spectators at the trial are, willingly  or not, allied with the machinery of injustice."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Even Better Than The First","text":"Enthralling mystery that keeps you in suspense right up until the end, and even more suspenseful than the first in the series."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Reading, thinking, & reflecting all in one!!","text":"Love the think\/relate aspect.

The South kept fighting until every Southern city was controlled by the Union.  A small agrarian nation, the South fought a large, industrialized nascent world power.  Unbelievably the South came close to winning this unequal contest.  To contend that the South failed because of lack of will is ahistoric and a contemptible insult to the brave rebels who fell under the stars and bars.

The lovely Gabriella D'Angelis wants to escape the dreary life of a bookstore owner.  Will Jack complete his task or will he learn to love Gabriella instead?<br \/><br \/>  Kathleen O'Reilly's ability to show any redeemable value in cold-hearted bad boy Jack Vassonovich is incredible.  Jack is more used to the boardroom than the bookstore whereas Gabriella knows that the heart is more important than any dollar amount.  The resulting clash is both sizzling and heart-warming.<br \/><br \/>  \"Nick\" by Julie Kenner is the story of Lucifer's second son, Nicholas Velnias.  Nick is a famous painter but each of his paintings captures a piece of the soul of the model.  His task: to capture the entire soul of Delilah Burnett.  Will Delilah's innate goodness overcome Nick's desire to please his father?<br \/><br \/>  Julie Kenner is an extremely talented author with a gift at creating poignant moments out of some very unusual circumstances.  Her characterizations of Delilah and Nick are captivating and very vivid as one can easily apply their circumstances to other real-life situations.  Julie Kenner maintains the heat level as \"Nick\" is a very sensual story.<br \/><br \/>  Dee Davis concludes this collection with \"Marcus\", the story of Lucifer's youngest son, Marcus Diablo.  Marcus is assigned the task of obtaining an infamous ruby called the Devil's Delight.  He'll have to work with old flame, Celeste Abbot, to locate the ruby.  But what choice will he make if the Devil's Delight is located?<br \/><br \/>  \"Marcus\" is an Indiana Jones style escapade that will delight those who enjoy the combination of steamy romance and high octane action.  Dee Davis produces an excellent modern day historical mystery.  The twists and turns will definitely keep readers on their toes!<br \/><br \/>  HELL WITH THE LADIES is an unusual anthology in that all three stories are intertwined nicely into a much larger story.  Each author contributes a piece of the story and the overall themes are well-managed.  Lucifer, while more of a sympathetic figure than one might expect, still maintains his evil status by assigning each son a task to obtain an object that can be used for great evil.  Kathleen O'Reilly, Julie Kenner, and Dee Davis are to be commended for the superb collaborative effort it took to have such a consistent and smoothly flowing anthology.  HELL WITH THE LADIES is definitely worth reading as it provides a unique twist on the ultimate bad boy theme- the sons of Lucifer!<br \/><br \/>COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Lisa does it again!","text":"You should buy this book and anything else Lisa publishes.

In describing the book to my brother, I was compelled to point out how the real subtext of this novel is that humanity is doomed.  The book was written in 1996, published in 1997 and describes the adventures of the final crew of the shuttle Discovery during the first fifteen years of the twenty-first century, set against a backdrop of a rapidly declining Earth.<br \/><br \/>The author, Englishman Steven Baxter, gets the development of American society flat wrong.  Disney merges with Coke and forms a monopoly over the web when every other internet provider is shut down.  There is never any doubt that a radically anti-science fundamentalist will be elected President of the United States in 2008.  The U.S. Air Force tries to shoot down America's last manned space mission.  After that, croplands dry up all over the world, segments of the United States secede (but strangely copy the right-wing agenda of the country they're seceding from), and the only really sympathetic character, Apollo veteran Marcus White, is euthanized in his nursing home.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, the heroes of the story, Paula Benacerraf and Benjamin Rosenberg, are flying to Titan with three other astronauts who are killed or crippled in nasty ways during or before the landing.  The new President abandons any effort to bring them home so they know they will die on Titan, but they are determined to get some useful science done and broadcast their findings back to Earth.  The focus of the mission changes after a giant bolide propelled by a Chinese nuclear explosion crashes into the Atlantic Ocean: Rosenberg believes their real mission is to store bacterial spores on Titan in a miraculous lake of liquid water, so they will be warmed in billions of years by the expanding sun and evolve into some form of life.  Earth is no longer there to return to even if anyone were interested in bringing them back.<br \/><br \/>This is one novel which I'm glad to say is unfilmable without a complete revision of the plot.  If I were filming this novel I would cast an ex-girlfriend as Paula and her real-life daughter as Paula's daughter Jackie, who is lucky enough to live in Seattle (the Pacific Northwest secedes from the US and becomes New Columbia).  The movie would be about how Marcus White started a space program in New Columbia to build spacecraft capable of retrieving the heroes from Titan and would end with them being rescued at the last second.  The actual ending of the novel beggars belief and is difficult to even describe.  There are lots of better books about the exploration of Titan out there.

I can see on the surface where the Jester might turn some people (even Patterson diehards) off.  A love story, adventure, mystery all wrapped in the setting of the Crusades?  This is definitely a departure for Patterson and if you go into this expecting Alex Cross I can see where you'd be disappointed.<br \/>That being said, the Jester has slowly become one of my favorite Patterson novels to date.  I say slowly because I have found that this story has stayed with me much longer than a Cross novel.  This is the type of story that is allowed to stew in your mind and grow with time.  I highly recommend the Jester.<br \/>Hugh De Luc plays the key role in this novel.  An innkeeper with adventurous ambition, Hugh leaves his family and home to pursue riches in the Crusades.  The Crusade story line does not dominate and should not scare away the casual reader.  The setting merely sets the stage for Hugh's acquisition of a relic that's value is unknown to even him.  Upon Hugh's return home he finds his village in shambles and his family presumably dead.<br \/>This sets in motion the key storyline of the Jester as Hugh goes in search of those responsible for ruining his life.  A David vs. Goliath revenge story unfolds with Hugh resorting to any means necessary to get close to those responsible for his pain, even resorting to taking up the role of a jester.  Here is able to gain the trust of those responsible and devise a plot worthy of the pain he has endured.  Along the way Hugh gains allies and uncovers truths beyond his imagination.  Patterson's imagery and detail pull you into the story as you root for Hugh in his own personal crusade.<br \/>Patterson and co-collaberator Andrew Gross tie everything together in a climatic final battle, discovery, and of course a Patterson plot twist.  The plot twist can be seen coming and came as little surprise to me.  While fault could be found in this fact, I still found The Jester well worth the time.  Patterson's trademark rapid pace keeps the pages turning and suspense mounting."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Fun and entertaining","text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered the Callahan Garrity series.

It came out in 1991 and contained 26 works by as many Latin American authors, from seven nations and Puerto Rico. Brazil, with 10 selections, and Argentina, with 5, were by far the most frequently represented countries; the emphasis on Brazil perhaps reflecting one of the compiler's specializations, Portuguese literature. With the exceptions of pieces by the writers Machado de Assis and Quiroga, who were described as the pair marking the start of modern Latin American literature, the book's selections covered the period from the 1940s to 1990, with special focus on the 1970s and 80s.<br \/><br \/>The collection featured old and new voices, the celebrated and the lesser known, and highlighted writers who created unexpected, dreamlike worlds. Some of the works could be regarded as classics: Machado de Assis's \"The Psychiatrist,\" Quiroga's \"The Dead Man,\" Borges' \"The Circular Ruins,\" Cort\u00e0zar's \"Axolotl,\" Carpentier's \"Journey Back to the Source,\" Guimar\u00e3es Rosa's \"The Third Bank of the River\" and Fuentes' \"The Doll Queen.\"<br \/><br \/>Other writers were well known - Onetti, Rulfo, Garc\u00eda M\u00e0rquez -- but their selections differed from the usual ones in other anthologies. There were other celebrated writers - Amado, Bioy Casares, Lispector, Scliar, Allende, Puig, Arenas, Cabrera Infante, Ferr\u00e9. And then writers who were comparatively lesser known and from Brazil (Armon\u00eda Somers, Murilo Rubi\u00e3o, Joao Ubaldo Ribeiro, Lygia Fagundes Telles, Rubem Fonseca, Paulo Em\u00edlio Salles Gomes) or Puerto Rico (Ana Lydia Vega). Writers who might be considered comparable in their creation of dreamlike worlds but who didn't make it into this anthology: Asturias, Levinson, Pinera, Arreola, Monterroso, Donoso and Peri Rossi.<br \/><br \/>Some of the stories were written in a minutely described, hallucinatory style and\/or seemed merely to pile incident upon incident (Borges, Carpentier, Bioy Cesares, Somers, Puig, Arenas, Garc\u00eda Marquez, Rulfo, Cabrera Infante). The one by Cabrera Infante differed from the rest in that it was a humorous parody filled with light-hearted wordplay by the narrator. But many of these stories were nearly unreadable and couldn't be penetrated in any depth. Exceptions for me were works that described the killing of a pig and a participant's revulsion in grotesque and memorable detail (Ribeiro), the shift in consciousness of a narrator who entered a museum (Cort\u00e0zar), and a narrator who sought a character from his childhood (Fuentes). These succeeded in drawing me in to their bizarre worlds.<br \/><br \/>Others were told clearly but in a style similar to folk tales or fables and involved extraordinary, larger than life events and\/or fantastic characters, such as a psychiatrist who decided to help humanity by building a madhouse in town (Machado de Assis), a father who went to live in a boat on the river and never returned (Guimar\u00e3es Rosa), a lover who escaped from an angry husband (Amado), a man who found and \"tamed\" a woman (Allende), a magician who could pull tigers out of his sleeves but was worn down by reality (Rubi\u00e3o), and the plagues of Egypt as described by the Egyptians (Scliar).<br \/><br \/>Others were also told in a more or less straightforward and realistic way but created a strong atmosphere of unreality or tension, as in the description of the death of a man (Quiroga), the events surrounding a murder (Onetti), the description of a plot by two characters against a third (Salles Gomes), a female narrator's budding independence from her controlling grandmother (Fagundes Telles), a narrator's description of the menace involved in several relationships, including her own (Vega), and the friendship of two girls at school that crossed racial and class boundaries (Ferr\u00e9). Fagundes Telles' writing was described by the writer as closer to the psychological precision of French writers from the 1940s and 50s than to the naturalism and regionalism (or magic realism) of her contemporaries, which won her comparisons with Colette.<br \/><br \/>Aside from the classic stories, I appreciated this collection most for the many examples of writing from Brazil, for a number of the more straightforward, well-constructed stories, and one or two of the folk tale-like stories."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"A must-have on your trip to the Big Island","text":"After reviewing most of the popular guidebooks to the big island, I can say that this one is clearly the best.

All in all, the book is an excellent guide for all parts of the island we visited.  The sections on volcano national park and Captain Cook monument give you the locals' scoop.

I very rarely give novels \"Five Stars', but Michael Connelly's, The Narrows is IT! Special agent, Rachel Walling, and retired Los Angeles Police Homicide Detective, Harry Bosch, begin working together to solve a murder of a retired fellow police detective. The deceased detective is found on his fishing boat dead, and his wife suspects murder. She calls on Bosch to investigate his death. Bosch is retired and working as a private detective. His investigation takes him to Las Vegas, Nevada, with a short stop in route. This is where he and Walling begin their search. Is it a murder? Perhaps not. Is it a self? Maybe yes. Bosch and Walling begin their search for the truth in Las Vegas. There they learn a few facts. Walling's FBI supervisor, does not want her getting involved \"personally\". He wants her just to follow him around. However, Walling does go with Bosch. In fact, they go to a small town north of Las Vegas, the only means of income is one bar and several little \"homes\" for prostitutes. Then back to Vegas and L.A. They do find the answer. If you want to learn how Bosch, and Walling find the answers, then buy and read this excellent novel. I honestly believe you'll thank yourself for buying.

Kimekomi - Japanese for \"tuck in\" - is very cool and fast fun if you're into instant gratification! :) Also called quilt balls, these make fun tree ornaments or bowl\/table accents.<br \/><br \/>The short version? Take a smooth foam ball, use a hot knife to cut your crevices\/tuck lines, cut little fabric shapes slightly larger than the lined areas, and you guessed it, tuck it in the slit! My first attempts using an exacto knife and a butter knife for tucking came out OK but had the down comforter puffy look.  Do it the \"right\" way with a hot knife and tucking tool and it comes out a thousand times better, neater, and  smooth like the photos.<br \/><br \/>Tool & Supply tips:<br \/><br \/>A \"hot knife\" is basically a not-so-sharp exacto knife tip on either a woodburning tool or the mini craft iron II, you might even have it already if you own either of those tools. Makes a nice, straight and smooth cut in the styrofoam ball. That was a new tool term for me so I went running around looking for something by that name before having a Duh! moment.<br \/><br \/>plasteelcorp sells smooth foam balls, any size will do, just remember bigger=heavier if you're doing Christmas ornaments! Up to 6\" should be fine unless your tree is really wimpy or you go nuts with the glue and ribbons on top! Majority of book patterns call for 3\" balls if you want to be ready when your book arrives.<br \/><br \/>Web search for Kimekomi \"tucking tool\", or \"tucking spatula\" and they are common enough.

They are a bit harder than the easy puzzles but not so difficult that you can't figure them out.<br \/><br \/>Keep in mind that these puzzles only range from easy to medium, so if you are looking for more of a challenge, check out the seller's other Sudoku books!

Ms. Carez did present a tale suited to just this after I gave up worrying on whether I had the right pronunciation of the language used. I felt my frustration with Ellseyan as her story unfolded and her path crossed with Marsem in an unexpected way, and the family bond and loyalty she shares with her brother. She can be related to by many as she is considered an `outcast' in her family. Despite the small frustrations that I encountered, this story was fast-paced, full of action during fighting scenarios, offers a love story and if one notices, a bit of spiritual enlightenment. I did find myself unable to put the book down as I was anxious to see what would happen next. This tale sets up perfectly for the next book to come in a way as I for one was left in suspense in my desire to know more of the main characters trials to encounter.<br \/><br \/>The down-side of `P&ugrave;qest Book 1: The Hunter\" for me was not that the author created a new world of un-ending possibilities, it was the `created' words (or language) was used often, and a small few were left undefined. A pronunciation key to know how to interpret the words would have helped me, personally to understand how to interpret the words. A handful of sentences had me wondering what was occurring or being expressed. I feel that Ms. Carez may risk others whom could also become confused, or put the tale down and move on. Until I decided just to `flow' with it and read the language without special attention, other than looking in the glossary when necessary, then I was able to get an understanding of what was being told and enjoyed it. As this story is taking place in another world or planet, I personally would have liked a `foreword' or similar to perhaps give us, the readers, a clear understanding (Think of Tolkien and preface for the Lord of the Rings.) of the place, history and time era."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"The preschool read this book in their class to my ...","text":"The preschool read this book in their class to my 3 year old...and now he is afraid of monsters which he wasn't before!

This is quite different from the cases of military or art history, for example.<br \/>Which is why this book is helpful. No one can seriously consider the history of the twentieth century without looking at the vast transformation of businesses and the marketplace which have taken place in this period.<br \/>The 300-odd pages contain photographs and articles from the New York Times which sweep through major epsiodes of twentieth century business including trust busting, the Great Depression, the electronics revolution, and mega-mergers at the close of the century. The articles are accompanied by commentary from the married couple who are the authors, both of whom have been business writers for the New York Times.<br \/>Whether you are a student doing research for a high school paper, or a policy maker who wants a quick reminder of the events and forces which have shaped business in this century, you will find this book highly readable and informative. In the introductory words of former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, &quot;Rereading history may never subtitute fully for personal experience in shaping our behavior. But there is something to the admonition of one of the 20th century's leading philosphers, George Santayana, about the importance of understanding the past.

It is kind of neat to get a glimpse of things through his unique perspective. But, that's where the positives end. I don't feel that Marcelo is the best character for this story's plot. It seems as though Stork already had a legal drama story ready to go and tried to push Marcelo in, even though he doesn't fit. I just don't see how Marcelo being autistic adds anything to the story, except validating confusing dialog where I have to step back and map out who is saying what, because the total absence of pronouns, while perhaps characteristic of autism, works against the reader in a literary form. If the story was just about Marcelo living his everyday life, it would be a refreshing change of pace, but putting him into this story creates a convoluted mash-up of under developed plot lines. The story leads you in one direction, only to completely abandon that path and pick up another in the opposite direction. Not like plot twists, but more like following a fly across the room, watching it randomly buzz about without any real direction. Stork sets the story up in one direction and then switches it to irrelevant, tangential plot lines. It is clear from the beginning what the \"result\" of his experience will be.

I have purchased virtually every 3-string guitar songbook on the market. Some are very good, some are overly complicated, others are poorly printed.

A Thousand Suns makes plain certain subjects (like house rulership) which were confusing and poorly explained in other books.<br \/>This book won't serve as a stand-alone if you want the actual mechanics of chart interpretation (Bloomfield wins on that score) but I highly recommend it for the mythological and historic background material which is essential to a deeper understanding for Westerners.

From the title(based on Emerson's reference to the creative mind as a fire) to the epilogue, the book is filled with essays about topics of interest to any and all readers who are willing to truly \"think\" about where their ideas came from and perhaps even be willing to challenge them. For starters, there's the essay entitled \"How to Be a Free Thinker,\" a personal favorite.<br \/><br \/>The writing is clear, crisp, and easy to understand. As a psychology instructor at a community college, I'm accustomed to reading texts and other types of psychological literature that is often pedantic and ponderous. Berkun's writing is so refreshing juxtaposed to my usual fare! Simple and deep at the same time, the essays provoked my thinking without using a lot of obscure jargon.<br \/><br \/>As a teacher, I'm always on the prowl for ideas to use in my classes, and I found several in Mindfire. For starters, I used this quote as a discussion prompt when covering factors affecting longevity: \"A funny thing about the human mind is that it tends to believe what it wants to believe....We worry about snakes, or getting on airplanes, when the real threats to longevity are cheeseburgers, chocolate shakes and long hours lounging on the couch.\" While the text said basically the same way, it didn't carry quite the same punch.<br \/><br \/>All of the essays are fantastic, and I hope to incorporate ideas from them into my courses next semester...and into my thinking for the rest of my life."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Great Series & I'm Already Reading the Next","text":"The third installment of this series gives a deeper look at the web of interstellar politics and connectedness going on in the universe and it's all taking place in Armstrong City Dome on the Moon. This one took me a little longer to get into because at the beginning there are points of view from characters unknown & unnamed on planets never heard of and in the past. I felt a bit disconnected and took in the information like one does all info dumps thinking that this is probably important to what's coming but this isn't making it a riveting read by any means. Things improved greatly when Noelle & Miles are back on the scene and it's clear that the story is firmly planted on the Moon. That's kind of what I'm here for. I liked meeting the mayor Arek Soseki and hope he's around for future books (perhaps as the governor-general because he had better foresight than the current one).<br \/><br \/>There was a detailed conspiracy going on concerning Etae and their bid to become part of Earth Alliance that was so multilayered I'm not exactly sure I've got all the details worked out. Suffice it to say, many threads were related and culminated in multiple murders, rioting and some serious terrorist activity that damaged the Dome and killed a bunch of people. The descriptions of that were unsettling. Also in the unsettling category was the way the media & corporate influence played a pivotal role in social sway and political shifts. It was an all too timely reminder of our modern age.<br \/><br \/>As always, Miles & Noelle get the job done in the end but this time they ended a lot farther from one another as the line that is the solitary life of a Retrieval Artist, has been underscored.

Higdon chronicles the story of a \u201cstreet boy\u201d coming of age in and around a vast Nairobi shantytown. We meet his family, friends, and many of those who either pulled him up or dragged him down. Yet it\u2019s more than a biography. It\u2019s a well-researched introduction to the social conditions that govern the day-to-day survival of immensely resourceful children in urban Africa. It\u2019s a graphic depiction of dangers and tragedies that relentlessly stalk street children, but it\u2019s also a story of resilience, loyalty and imagination. And if that weren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s a genuine morality tale, a hero\u2019s journey, a depiction of true community in dire circumstances. \"Hope and a Future\" simultaneously entertains, engages, informs and inspires. It also is being used to jump-start an imaginative initiative, Little Boost Press, to help children in situations like the one described in the book.

The author is frustrated and spends too much time berating other people's work, and his attempt to explain SQL is poorly illustrated.  This book is mistakenly referred to as the bible of relational databases and the only explanation I can think for this is that it has been around for so long and read by so many people that are endeared by the unreachable tone of his writing, that they assume this is how it should be written.

The guy just writes so wonderfully - like Wodehouse - and the dialogue is full of good (frightfully British) humour and character. Moreover the comic observations on the everyday are clever and flawlessly executed. The setting is surprisingly coherent when you get down to it (I *love* the way he casually resolves the sofa paradox that's been running through the whole book) - there's really nothing I can think of to complain about with it. I'm used to books lifting me up and then disappointing, but this manages to ebulliently float you along from start to finish.<br \/>I'm so glad I decided to start rereading books. It must be over a decade since I'd read this and I only had the vaguest recollection of some of the key images. But the chief pleasure of Adams can't be reduced to, say, the plot line, which, while fine, is in one way incidental (i.e. the characters and dialogue are good enough to stand alone). I get the impression he was in a fairly positive state of mind when he wrote this (as opposed to Mostly Harmless), and in excellent form, so these character's are simply pleasant to be with - as well as being hilarious and - as with those of Pratchett on a good day - charming."},{"label":-1,"rating":3.0,"title":"Stickers not precisely cut and\/or printed","text":"[[VIDEOID:e7fc1caa14437d5d2e1760e886e134b6]] Perfectionists beware.

Act 3 is as good as anything I've read.  All three story lines were epic.  The Great Ordeal-epic battles, struggles (internal and external), death, dust, despair.  Kellhus was far more interesting, though not in much of the story.  Esmenet - far far far more interesting story line with her, her insane children, Maithanet and the capital.

Wander across the Ozarks from Springfield through the Irish Wilderness to the Bootheel.  You can see how easy it would be 150 years ago to hide out in Lynn Creek or Pilot Knob.

Since then I've made 35 recipes out of \"Indian Home Cooking\" - which may not seem like a lot, but when you consider that I eat out more than 50% of the time and I don't think I've made more than 10 recipes from any other cook book I have ever owned - not to mention that there are a few of the recipes that I like so much that I tend to make them repeatedly (grape raita, stir fried green beans with coconut, stir-fried carrots with cumin and lime, coconut chicken with cashews, ground turkey with spinach and whole spices, and mangalore fried shrimp), 35 recipes actually is pretty good!  Tonight I made three that I hadn't tried before:  the red kidney beans with ginger, tomato and curry leaves; green chutney; and onion pachadi.  As usual they were all wonderful - although I probably didn't pick the best complements since all three have lots of onions in them.  I'm hoping to try another 30 recipes in this book by the end of the year.  Making things from this cookbook is one of my favorite simple pleasures in life, particularly when we have friends over to share the deliciousness.<br \/><br \/>Before Suvir Saran introduced me to Indian cooking, I was intimidated by it.  While I loved going out for Indian food, there were such varied and unrecognizable flavors to me that I couldn't even imagine how the dishes were made.  Yet, once I started making Saran's easy-to-follow recipes I found that it really isn't difficult at all.  In fact, I now understand the basic cooking techniques and spices well enough that I can look in my refrigerator to see what ingredients I have and then improv something using Indian spices and cooking techniques and end up with something that tastes great.<br \/><br \/>I'm not a vegetarian and have always felt sorry for my vegetarian friends because of how much they were missing out on the flavors and variety of an omnivore diet.  In fact, often when I ate vegetarian meals in the past I felt unsatisfied.  Yet, if I were to cook out of \"Indian Home Cooking\" every day, I could easily be a vegetarian and not feel like I was missing out on anything.  The flavors are varied and interesting enough that I don't feel the need to necessarily include meat dishes in meals.  When I do cook an Indian meal, frequently the meat dishes are a small part of the meal, rather than the focal point.  I guess what I'm saying is that when I cook out of \"Indian Home Cooking\" I tend to eat more vegetables and less meat - which is a far healthier diet.  If I could only keep one cook book of any type of cuisine, \"Indian Home Cooking\" would be it."},{"label":-1,"rating":2.0,"title":"Poorly structured story.

Instead, the book felt like a rant about politics; a rant which just happens to be written by a cognitive scientist. Many studies are mentioned, but little detail is provided (though, the author does include references), and the discussion feels very much like hand-waving. I don't doubt the author's own credentials, but he leaves little opportunity for the reader to reach their own conclusions.<br \/><br \/>I therefore found the political discussion unconvincing and cheesy (this may have also have been in part because I am not an American and the book is very US-centric).<br \/><br \/>However, the book was not a complete waste of my time -- I did enjoy reading it as it offered a way of thinking about discourse in terms of framing and metaphors."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"One of my all time favorites","text":"I kept hearing about this book, and finally read it at the beginning of this year. I ended up staying up all night reading it! It's true what some detractors say about them acting like children in a professional work environment. It gets pretty established though that the work environment is hostile in a lot of ways, since it was a merger of two very different companies with opposing views on the world of publishing. The co-CEO is a blatant sexist. The main character Lucy acknowledges that she's not proud of her behavior, and you get the sense her nemesis Josh never has been proud of it either. He says as much actually. People aren't perfect. We find out that Lucy's childishness is due to just being plain lonely and homesick and wanting attention from the only person she interacts with day in and day out. She's smart and quirky and witty, with lots of attitude. I loved seeing the layers of Josh peeling away as well throughout the book, and learning why he acts the way he does. The way they banter and flirt is amazing, and seeing their relationship develop was so rewarding, paying off with one of the sweetest and hottest love scenes I've read since Chapter 55 of ACOMAF. These are two complex, imperfect people that are perfect for each other, challenge each other, and come to understand each other on a soul deep level. I loved it so much."},{"label":1,"rating":4.0,"title":"CHILLING SUSPENSE, FINE AS A STAND ALONE TOO","text":"VANISH is part 5 in the Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles series. However I read it as a stand alone and did just fine, so I can recommend it that way too. I'd also never heard of author Tess Gerritsen before this but will definitely be searching out more from her and this series. I loved her style of writing, the realistic characters, the suspenseful medical based plot and the fast moving thrill of this story as a whole. There were elements that you could tell if you were invested in the series (and reading it in order) would have been even better or funnier or sadder however I never felt lost or left out of some big plot due to the excellent story telling. This is crime writing suspense at its very best.<br \/><br \/>Vanish pulls you in from the very first page starting with Mila's heartbreaking story of human trafficking. She and a group of Russian girls are crossing into America from Mexico having been lured there by the promise of a better life however by the end of the chapter one of the girls is dead and Mila has been sold into a prostitution ring. Mila's story (which we keep flashing back to) is gritty and often hard to read probably because it is very real.<br \/><br \/>We then switch to coroner Maura Isles who is going about her daily routine (in vivid medical detail) when she discovers that one of the bodies in the morgue is still alive. \"Jane Doe\" is rushed to the emergency room where we meet up with our other protagonist Detective Jane Rizzoli who has just gone into labour following a take down at the courthouse (she rocks)<br \/><br \/>Through a fantastic series of events that kept me on the edge of my seat and never able to guess what was coming next, the formerly \"dead\" woman grabs a security guards gun and takes 6 people hostage in the hospital, one of which is Detective Rizzoli. \"Jane Doe\" won't talk to the police negotiator and we only learn her motives after a man disguised as member of the SWAT team joins her. His story is equally enthralling.<br \/><br \/>This tense drama plays out for a large part of the book bringing in a host of other characters (and their POV'S) along with clever plot twists and exciting action. All of which Gerritsen manages to tie together. We meet Jane's husband FBI agent Gabriel Dean (I'm assuming we met him in earlier books) we also have Jane's partner (hints of a love triangle), reporters, spies and bad guys in Washington. We get crime scene investigations and the makings of a political thriller which thankfully doesn't take over and a very realistic story involving a new mother trying to get to know her baby while maintaining her identity. Throughout it all we keep coming back to Mila and her story is the one that haunts me.<br \/><br \/>What a fantastic unputdownable read. Not my usual fare but a series I will definitely be coming back to. Cheers."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Beautifully written.","text":"This is such a beatifully written book.

Seton takes her time, describing the girl's life growing up in England, her voyage across seas to a new land, and her adult life in Massachusetts and Connecticut. It is a fascinating story and once again, Seton does an immense amount of research that makes the novel even more enjoyable to read. I certainly recommend it for anyone from the New England area, as the Winthrops were quite a prominent family in the 17th century. One of Seton's best."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Five Stars","text":"love this book"},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Be Ready To Spend Some Time Cooking","text":"This cookbook works to ensure your access authentic Indian recipes!

I admit that this book had been sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust. I also admit to enjoying the Twilight books, so I was not opposed to Ms. Meyer's writing or style. But I'm not a huge Sci-Fi person, and the premise of this book just did not appeal to me, despite having friends tell me how much they liked it. So I procrastinated...and procrastinated...and procrastinated. It took the movie and a Stephenie Meyer event I attended to kick me in the butt and move it up my reading pile. And once I read it, what do I have to say now?<br \/><br \/>I LOVED IT! This was one of those books where I just shook my heads and thought to myself, \"What took me so long?\" This was a beautifully written book, exposing the many layers of love and humanity. The size of the book is intimidating, and it starts a bit slowly. But I found reading it worth the time and for me the reading process quickly sped up as I became more and more engaged and invested with the characters and plot. I found the plot unique and engaging, the character development well fleshed-out, the multi-layers of love development thoughtful, and the analysis of real humanity beautifully examined.<br \/><br \/>I also admit to not being a fan of love triangles. They tend to be exhausting, unrealistic, selfish, and overly dramatic. But what I loved about this story is that it really wasn't a love triangle, not in the simplistic sense of the term. I don't want to spoil the plot, but I found the whole thought process and relationship between Melanie and Wanderer fascinating. I really found their relationship the most engaging. Then with a love interest or two thrown in there, and the confusion over two minds sharing one body, the plot really thickened, but again, with an imaginative process. And the love discussed wasn't limited to just romantic love - there's also friendship, family, forgiveness, camaraderie, community, sacrifice, and many levels of love in between these. This is one of the things and subjects I was most impressed with in this novel.<br \/><br \/>Bottomline: I loved this book and added it as one of my favorites. I have also listened to the audiobook (because I needed to read\/hear the book twice in a row, it was so good), and found the narrator quite engaging, so if you'd prefer the audio-version over text, I highly recommend it. This is one of those books you don't want to pre-judge. Perhaps you disliked Twilight, perhaps you hate love triangles, or perhaps you have an aversion to Sci-Fi.

The soliloquys could be a bit much at times  and a little distracting, but in a way, they added to the flavor and  uniqeness of the novel. A fresh idea, or something that seemed out of the  ordinary to me, was Brandon's almost year-long celibacy.

It was a real struggle for me to finish the last 40 pages or so, because I just didn't care anymore.<br \/>Overall, it reads like a lukewarm rehash of Ludlum's earlier (and much better) book AQUITAINE PROGRESSION. The problem as I see it, is that the Ludlum of today no longer connects the twists and turns to the story.

Each book can be read alone and in any order a reader chooses.  The novels include some of the favorite characters from Johnstone country such as Smoke and Sally Jensen, Preacher, etc.<br \/>In A Death Valley Christmas, it was enjoyable to meet up again with Ace and Chance Jensen.

It fulfilled my strongest desire for a reading experience: to be transported to another time and place. The first part, chronicling Sidonie's pre-Morocco experiences of disease and loss, was difficult reading, because it was hard to watch someone having such a miserable life (although the author made it completely believable). But, once she got to Morocco, the story really turned around for me. The author did a great job of depicting the country, and I felt that I was there with Sidonie. The characters were interesting and well developed. From a travel standpoint, it was great: the very atmospheric back alleys of Marrakesh in 1930 and the landscape beyond the cities, with the nomadic Tuaregs. But it was also fascinating to watch Sidonie's development from a sheltered, repressed individual to one with growing confidence and a real sense of being where she was meant to be.

After reading his latest effort, I must say that I likely won't waste my time reading another of his books. I applaud him for writing a book about this campaign, but it is again painfully obvious that he has limited writing skills, a poor grasp of character development, a lack of technical knowledge regarding weapons, army organization, etc., and a real ignorance of militaries other than the United States. As other reviewers have stated, the few battle scenes are poorly drawn, and unexciting, he makes numerous technical errors, and the fictional protangists in particular are unconvincing. Another reviewer mentioned the removal of Jewish American POWS, by black trench-coated Gestapo agents, in Tunisia, in May. Never happened, and this was the final straw for me. I will admit that I expect an author to know his subject, especially when it comes to historical topics. If Bernard Cornwall, Patrick O'Brien, W.E.B. Griffith,C.S. Forrester, etc., etc. can do it, why not Shaara? It amazes me that so many people rave about this book, and his earlier efforts. He apparently has a well-oiled publishing machine, and he sells books, so the bottom line is that we can expect more of the same, but I doubt any any better effort will result."},{"label":1,"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Book","text":"This book was assigned by my Grad Instructor and it has really helped me grasp the world of Assessments.

Good surprise."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Great comprehensive history","text":"In terms of format, this book is almost like a textbook of Byzantine history. Each chapter has a clear purpose and a mini-timeline, differences in text size and shape mark off the sections and subsections, and there are even inserts every few pages with primary sources. This actually helped me mentally organize the details of what was happening - there's a lot to keep track of in 12 centuries!<br \/><br \/>A few elements that I really liked:<br \/>1) Graphic Organizers and Visuals. The author occasionally made use of graphic organizers - for example, representing the hierarchy of Byzantine governments with a table, or showing the decline in value of the nomismata in the 11th century. In addition, rather than banishing the images to an appendix, the author actually integrates them into the relevant sections of the text. It's a pleasant surprise to find a historian who actually appreciates the value of a good illustration to, you know, illustrate history.<br \/><br \/>2) Breadth. This is a broad history - the focus is not just on the emperors or on Constantinople, but on the Empire as a whole. I appreciate that the author takes the time to explore social and economic trends, art, literature, and ordinary life.<br \/><br \/>3) Historiography. The author cites other scholars, and also talks about both debates and shifts in understanding. The best example was his take on the Blues vs. Greens fights of the 5th-6th centuries. According to the author, while older scholars often tried to impose a religious, class, or political ideology on these fights, it's better to view the Blues and Greens as the Late Antiquity version of football hooligans who liked to riot. As a non-expert, it's actually helpful for me to understand how scholarship has changed.<br \/><br \/>4) The last chapter is about post-Byzantine Byzantine culture. Most Byzantine histories that I read use the last chapter to eulogize the fallen empire. In contrast, this author actually explores what happened to Byzantine culture after the Ottoman conquest. I appreciate that the author acknowledges that the Greeks, Armenians, and Slavs didn't just magically stop practicing their culture after 1453.<br \/><br \/>Great general history, would recommend it to anyone new to the Byzantine fandom."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"Great Insight","text":"Susanna Kaysen gave a very well detail description of her struggle and livelyhood as a mental patient in a ward and her perspective of the world"},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"A great summer read.","text":"This is not a book that I would normally choose.

They also bond over their love of Mia's grandmother, who may be one of the best gran's ever!<br \/><br \/>Mia is a bit all over the place emotionally. She's just decided to quit her job at her dad's law firm and her parents do not take it well. They're incredibly selfish people and I was glad that Mia distanced herself from them. Her grandmother is great and encourages her to pursue other interests, including getting her with Nate. Nate is a retired doctor from L.A., now living in a small town. He's interested in Mia immediately and I loved watching them get closer.<br \/><br \/>There are a couple sad moments in this, but overall it's a fun story about doing what you're passionate about and not holding back.

They both grew so much over the course of this story, which I lived for. Not only them, there were also side characters showing obvious signs of growth. Any author capable of doing that deserves an extra star in my book!<br \/>When it comes to Georgie, I specifically loved seeing her go from being and feeling the \u201clittle sister\u201d towards being her own woman, standing up for herself and fighting for what she wants. Seeing that evolution was wonderful.<br \/><br \/>As mentioned in the triggers, there are quite a few explicit sex scenes in this book. I didn\u2019t mind them at all \u2013 but I know some people don\u2019t care for that type of thing. All in all, I found them well written \u2013 apart from all the dirty talk. I\u2019m simply.. not that kind of person so I wouldn\u2019t have mind had that aspect not been present, haha.<br \/><br \/>In my intro, I mentioned the renovating company being one of the things that piqued my interest. It wasn\u2019t that present, but it was there enough for me to be satisfied. As for the fake relationship-trope? I loved how it was done! Not every author is able to pull it off, but I enjoyed seeing Georgie and Travis struggle with their feelings, doubting the realness of their fake relationship and eventually having to admit to themselves what was going on. Yup, definitely my cup of tea!<br \/><br \/>I only have ONE but:<br \/><br \/>Travis, our other main character, definitely had his own demons to fight. Unfortunately, the story focused way more on Georgie\u2019s growth, struggle and evolution than it did on his. I would\u2019ve loved to have more insight in his past, his brain and his feelings.

Please head there for more in-depth reviews by me, which appear on a timely schedule.<br \/><br \/>'Skeleton Key' is the third book in this series about Alex Rider, a teenage spy. Alex is sent on an expensive holiday to Skeleton Key in Cuba. Well, it's supposed to be a holiday, but really he's there to do his job - nuclear war is coming. Hit the jump for more...<br \/><br \/>Alex is given the opportunity to see tennis live at Wimbledon. However, instead of the interesting time he expected to have, he uncovers a sinister plot by the Triad. He heads off on a surfing holiday with his budding girlfriend Serena, but is followed there by the Triad. MI6 says that they will put him out of harm's way by sending him on a tropical vacation. What could go wrong? Everything in fact.<br \/><br \/>I think the most enjoyable thing of this novel was the ending, seeing Alex push through the terrors he had been through to become a better person on the other side. In this novel you can really see him grow up, and start taking an interest in girls. Horowitz has managed to take a series that could become quite stale with the same character and same spy elements and make it continue to develop.<br \/><br \/>This novel is more bloody than the first two novels (in the same way that the Harry Potter series became more adult as it progressed). I'd still say that children could read it, but not those with impressionable minds or those who were likely to be scared. If they enjoyed the first two novels, this is certainly not too much of a step forward."},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"The strength of this book is its focus on the life stories of individual civil servants.","text":"It does not neglect the big picture, and provides extensive description of Trump's transition team (which he had to be forced to accept.)

It starts with them having to deal with an entire town of people snickering and mocking them for being \"ugly\" and terrible people for what they did to poor Ella. They locked her up and made her a servant to them,etc (you know the story). So, people charge them more for less and they run low on money so bad things happen.<br \/>The story really focuses on one stepsister though both are part of the whole story. Isabelle is the main character and the one that longs the most to be beautiful because she feels that to be beautiful is all it takes to get what you want in the world. Like Ella. So when she meets a \"fairy god mother\" of sorts that's what she says she wants the most so when she is told she needs to do somethings before her wish can be granted, she sets out to do them.On the other side she has \"fate\" and \"chance\" betting on her. Each comes into play as a person in her life. How they play their part is for you to find out.<br \/>So much is going on and happening in this book, I'm not even touching the surface. This book is packed full of story. It has some 'girl power' themes running through it that are really good with some strong messages for young and old alike. It has so many good things going for it! If I were to say anything negative at all it would be that I have to admit at one or two points I got pulled out of the story a little bit. I'm not sure if there was just so much going on it got distracting or if at a few points there was a lull that just stalled it?

Then specific stitches, not just cross stitch, but many others that may be used individually or with cross stitch are introduced.(The photography and charting is excellent, showing some of the best detail work I've yet seen.) And you go on to exercises that develop skill in that particular technique or material or both with the use of a motif. There is information on creating patterns, working with computer design, reproducing designs from pictures, using mirrors to graph corners, reverse designs, central themes and borders. There is even a section on blocking. Much more is included in this book than I could record here. This is really a compendium.

I was looking forwards to immersing myself in a story that had the potential to put me on edge, unfortunately, that didn't happen. It took me 4 days to read 325 pages, kinda says it all really.<br \/><br \/>The book started off well but I soon found my attention wandering. I couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters, they were flat and unappealing. The reasonings behind the characters actions were insubstantial, I felt like they were just going through the motions for the sake of the story. Where was the fear? The inner conflict? The panic? There was nothing of substance driving them, they came across as puppets playing out a story rather than real people living through the story.<br \/><br \/>Throughout the book the reader is taken back and forth between several different timelines. The timelines reveal the history of the mirror, how it came to be, and the characters that have been a part of its story before the present timeline. For this format to work the different timelines need to come together, to flow into each other and build a bigger picture, a more in-depth understanding, but in this case they felt disjointed and too separate from one another. The ending felt rushed and thrown together. I think I was holding out hope that things would come together in the end and that it would at least be worth the reading time invested. It wasn't, it lead to even more disappointment<br \/><br \/>There was also quite a few inconsistencies and plot holes, as well as many spelling mistakes, typos, wrong words etc, which really didn't help improve the reading experience.<br \/><br \/>Not one I would recommend."},{"label":-1,"rating":2.0,"title":"I was disappointed.

Imagine a Christian version of Indiana  Jones who travels the word with his two teenage kids having archeological adventures in the 1990's.<br \/><br \/>This book is not the best in the series, and the series is not the best writing Peretti has ever done.  The plots, dialog, character development, and style in the five books I've read so far just aren't on par with some of the other books he has written.  That said, my 9 and 12 year old children love the series and I can be confident that each page is kid safe.  The stories may not have allegories and apologetical theory wrapped in every other sentence, but they have a sprinkle of scripture in good measure along with practical application of faith by each and every character that is believable.<br \/><br \/>This particular book has an unexplained premise that really doesn't make a lot of sense even when you are open to a supernatural explanation.  The resolution also leaves a lot to be desired as it doesn't fit either into a good theologian's prayer book or a Scooby-Do scientific \"Man behind the curtain\" kind of explanation.  But like most of the books in this series, the plot allows for tension to build through the story that gives the author time to plant seeds of wisdom and faith.  And more importantly as I said before, my kids are no where near as critical as I am and truly loved it.

No different than any other modern guitar book.","text":"The far, far majority of rock musicians have always been male.  I honestly have no idea why, but that's the hard truth.  As a result, few companies ever bothered to market something specifically for female musicians.  However, by the mid-1990s a significant number of guitar-driven bands with one or more female musicians had made waves on the scene (White Zombie, The Breeders, Veruca Salt, Smashing Pumpkins, Jewel, Hole, Cheryl Crow, etc.).  And today, a higher percentage of women can be seen in the local music scenes and even in working in musical instrument stores.<br \/><br \/>Tish Ciravolo took advantage of this new target audience and created Daisy Rock: a line of guitars and basses created for female musicians.  Not only are they made to look more \"girly\", but since women are physically different than men, the guitars also have a different contour in the body and the length is scaled smaller.  It was a smart move on Ciravolo's part, and one that was long overdue.  For women who want to start playing guitar or bass, I highly recommend checking these out.<br \/><br \/>It was all because of Daisy Rock's success that Ciravolo was approached to write a guitar book.  Hence, \"Girl's Guitar Method\".  It's a guitar book\/CD for beginners with some flowery graphics and...well, unfortunately that's about it.<br \/><br \/>In and of itself, the book is a decent guitar lesson book.  It includes what you normally find in other guitar books: tablature readings, instructions on how to tune, construction of chords, a chord dictionary, and modern examples (\"alternative music\" and the like) to listen and play to, structured into lessons that start at the most basic level and get increasingly advanced.  But strip away the curvy fonts and other girly doodles, and you're left with a book that's really no different from the numerous other guitar books on the market today.  To me, that makes the title rather deceiving, especially to those just starting on the instrument.<br \/><br \/>In all fairness, I don't see how one COULD write guitar lessons for women specifically.  It would be like trying to write a book called \"Men's Crochet Method\", by taking a random crochet book and putting Freddy Kreuger's sweater on the front cover, maybe an irrelevant centerfold inserted too.  Same book, just repackaged in order to market it to a new audience.  Unfortunately, \"Girl's Guitar Method\" is no different.  I'm sure some will blindly assume I'm a chauvinist and mark this review as \"not helpful\" just out of spite, but for those who value your playing more than fancy marketing, you may first want to check out some of the much more informative (and cheaper) guitar books out there."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"the enjoyment of which will depend upon how much you like ...","text":"Nonessential personal essays, the enjoyment of which will depend upon how much you like the author and want to get behind her books or more noteworthy public appearances such as being on Colbert for starting an independent bookstore in Nashville or being protested by Christian fundamentalists for allegedly writing a pornographic, drug-filled book about her friendship with author Lucy Grealy.

Tangled shoestrings of comments from Steve Jobs, plus those of the people who knew him, are juxtaposed with sudden references to \"I\" (e.g Jobs says he liked King Lear, and \"I asked him why he related to King Lear...\") If this is an interview, write it as such.  If it's a biography, as touted, then please remove yourself from it, oh, writer.  The sentences are stilted, forced, and lack any creativity.  A pure statement of facts--a facts sheet, if you will--would read more eloquently than this work of non-fiction.  As it stands now, \"Steve Jobs\" is a cobbled patchwork of facts with conjunctions and prepositional phrases thrown in to link them. It's downright painful to read.<br \/><br \/>If one were unaware that this was a published biography, and merely read it under the misrepresentation that a high school student turned it in for their English class project, it would be both believable, and highly defensible. The wisdom of Steve Jobs is lost in the hands of this \"professional writer\", who casts a murky haze over the biography just as a death shroud obscures a corpse.  It is so poorly constructed, so rudimentary in its prose, that it can only come \"alive\" in television sound bites, where it barely breathes with gasping shallow respirations, as if it was a boat-landed carp.<br \/><br \/>A powerful operatic aria for Mr. Jobs, the one all Apple fans long for, this work is not.<br \/><br \/>Mr. Jobs accepted this biography, unreviewed and unedited.

It certainly would have made reading this 630 page doorstop more enjoyable.<br \/><br \/>As it is now, the message of the genius, Jobs, is undecipherable in the apple sauce of this text.  It is quite concerning that the New York literati down at Simon & Schuster publishing house would allow this unedited drone into the print shop.

And \"The Celestial Globe\" 4-Stars.<br \/><br \/>But something happened with \"Jewel of Kalderash\".

Let Stalin's facts speak for themselves, don't give me opinions on how wrong it is to kill millions of your own people.  As a piece of Cold War propaganda, Communists are all evil people, or stupid, or worse, Like calling Russian theorists of the pre revolution period 'crackpots'.  Nice.

Stalin, certainly his victims IN the party and their contemporaries believed in what they were doing.<br \/>  That said, Stalin IS a horribly cruel mass murderer. But let the reader understand the entire picture, why was Stalin the way he was?  Why were Russians so willing to kill 'class enemies'? American and western students especially need to understand why people joined Communists: growing up in an environment where children are taught \"Better listen to Mommy and don't talk to commies\".

Maybe it's a good way to make children feel good.<br \/>  This is what makes history so important, that the worst crimes are always perpetrated by those who fervently believed that right was on their side.

I wouldn't actually compare it to Uprooted at all. The Waking Land is *not* a fast paced story. When I first started it, I was in love with it. It was just as beautiful as the cover. I found the nature references appealing, and I was intrigued. That didn't last long, though. I don't know what happened, but by the end, I was forcing myself through it. If not for review, I don't think I'd have finished it, nor do I plan to read any future books at this point. It gets really slow by the end, and I didn't even care what happened by then. (I don't even mind slower books, in general, but this one didn't work for me.) Too, just like in the Legacy Trilogy, the main character annoyed me more than not.<br \/><br \/>This book wasn't for me, but it does have enough going for it that it might be the perfect read for you.

A giant chunk of the book is devoted to prep for something in Tiawan that gets absolutely abandoned. The book literally tells you.. none of this mattered.<br \/><br \/>The series started falling after the introduction of multiple POVs. Owen's however are normally character building and good story telling. In this book he's comic relief and side story filler. He does nothing to progress anything but get a pet. It's amusing to read, but it comes off like a novella insert into a compendium by a guest author, not the captain of the series....<br \/><br \/>Atticus and his whole story is rushed. A big fight with the world serpent is over in a few paragraphs, and even then it's mostly filler. The Hel battle, maybe 1-2 pages? Everything that was supposed to be building up to is forgettable. This is an absolute let down from what was hands down one of the best fantasy series in existence. Calling this book fanfiction is by no means a stretch. Plague of Giants is even worse, with a dozen POV's with nonsensical names, it's even harder to follow.

Then it flows into what may seem the starting spot wherein the lead protagonist, Reve (short for Revelation, which is a family name) Maskalyne, kills her magician husband, Jeremy, when the gun she normally used for a magic trick is switched with a real loaded gun.<br \/><br \/>There is a bit plasticity to these opening scenes and frankly, I was glad to be out of Vegas and in Five Corners and Hawley so the real story begins. The man who killed her husband is still stalking them so Reve returns to her hometown at the urging of her grandmother. She also takes back her maiden name of Dyer. It isn't just to camouflage herself and her daughters but also a return to a tradition of the Dyer women using their maiden names.<br \/><br \/>I liked how Szarlan also brings in the viewpoints of the daughters (15 year old Grace and Faith along with ten year old Cayleigh) even though most of the book is told from first person narration of Reve.<br \/><br \/>Once Reve and family are back in Five Corners, Reve begins to piece together her family legacy and how it may affect her. It also leads her back to her childhood friend and first love who is now the chief of police in Hawley. Not that Reve is fully ready for a romance so soon after losing her husband but the connection is there nonetheless.<br \/><br \/>Interesting parts of the book is when Szarlan tantalizes with the use of magic but she also ups the tension with the addition of another murder of Reve's college friend many years prior. At first this addition seems tacked on but it actually does work later in the story.<br \/><br \/>My issue with the story is that there just seems a little too much going on that. There were times when I'd get mixed up with the different Revelations. We never really get more of the Las Vegas situation. The main 'villain' never really feels like much of a threat. We know he's a problem early on but once we get to the revelation, it is thin and under-explained so I felt a let down at the end that I can't quite shake off.<br \/><br \/>But again, the potential is there for a solid series. More use of American history and folklore and how the Dyer line figures into it. More development for the daughters who also have magic in them. Just more development for all the characters as Reve digs more into her legacy and the town(s) as well."},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"Cute and silly","text":"Dragon is looking for a friend.

Guthrie, Dylan, and the author were not poor or working class. They all came from comfortable money with Guthrie and Dylan both posing as something they were not. To his credit, Guthrie tried to live the life he sang about. He actually joined the struggle to change things and stayed with it throughout his life until his illness stopped him. Dylan, on the other hand, seems to have consciously decided early on to stay away from any real political involvement. So he appears to be a strange choice to illuminate our political history and the very real anger which grows out of it. That's why it seems to me that this book is really about the angst of two teenage boys, the author's, in his suburban childhood and Dylan's in his younger days. Real adult anger, in the sense this book tries but fails to convey, would not only rail against injustice but would also do something about it, preferably over the long haul.<br \/><br \/>If you want to see what genuine political anger looks like, I would suggest two books to start. The first would be Naomi Klein's &#34;The Shock Doctrine&#34; which will give you the brutally ugly history of the United States from the 1950's to the present, a history that you rarely, if ever, hear in this country. As a side comment, I would note that Klein is also a dedicated activist who acts on her politics. The second book is Marge Piercy's &#34;City of Darkness, City of Light&#34; a searing novel about the French Revolution. She dissects with an angry scalpel how the king, the nobility, the liberal middle class, and the radicals all squabbled and bickered among themselves for power while the working class and the poor went hungry again and again. I would also have to comment that while I know nothing of Piercy's personal life, a number of her novels are very political, burning with anger, with vision, and with hope.<br \/><br \/>There are several other things to add about Daniel Wolff's book. He ends on some grim notes. Guthrie's activism wound down in the 1950's while McCarthyism was raging full force. The last chapter of the book details the harsh economic realities of our times - the collapse of the union movement as well as the growing poverty and income inequality. There are some key things his angst misses though. First, it's clear now that political change in this country moves in waves. There are periods of intense activism as well as lulls and\/or times of repression. Second, even with that ebbing and flowing, it's also clear that real change has been happening. Slavery, women as chattel, and child labor are all gone, after some hard fought, long drawn out battles. There is still much, much that has to be done but there have been real improvements for women, for children, for people of color, and for our LGBTQ communities.Finally, as grim as things are economically and politically right now, the core truth of today is that we are at a significant crossroads for all of humanity. The climate change clock is ticking, whatever climate deniers wish to believe. We either change things now or we destroy the earth's systems that sustain human life. Daniel Wolff does not even begin to address that reality in this book. Even so, that's where the real grown up anger of today needs to be focused and needs to be actually doing something.<br \/><br \/>P.S.

Smith continues her Night World series with Gillian and a guardian angel, Rashel the vampire-hunter with a vampire soulmate, and Hannah and Thierry, the original soulmates.<br \/><br \/>===<br \/><br \/>Night World #4: Dark Angel, by L. J. Smith<br \/><br \/>At first \"Dark Angel\" doesn't seem like a typical Night World book. Gillian Lennox is a normal teenager; someone that many teen girls could probably relate too.  She's not one of the popular crowd but instead is a shy outcast. Her two goals in life are somewhat superficial: she wants to be popular, and she wants David Blackburn to love her. But then who wasn't superficial when they were a teen?<br \/><br \/>Gillian's introduction to the Night World comes when she has a near death experience. On her way home from school, she goes into the snowy woods after she thinks she hears a child crying. Instead she falls into a creek and hypothermia sets in. But she's rescued by Angel, a celestial being who guides Gillian back to the road. But Angel turns out to be more than just a lifesaver, as he starts to help Gillian fulfill her goals. He whispers the secrets of popularity in her ear, helping a shy girl transform into a vivacious butterfly. But as Gillian's status increases at school, she starts to become suspicious of her guardian angel...who is he really? And what does he want with David?<br \/><br \/>The Night World connection in this book is tenuous, but it does make sense. After all, in a world populated with werewolves, vampires, and other supernatural creatures, it's natural that spirits would exist as well. So far Gillian is probably the most identifiable of all the protagonists in the Night World books, as she's your everyday teenage girl who finds out that there's a secret world...and she's part of it. How many of us have wished for that? I know I have.<br \/><br \/>For me, \"Dark Angel\" is a solid chapter in the Night World series, but it doesn't really stand out, but then it isn't bad either. It's a good story of growth.<br \/><br \/>3\/5.<br \/><br \/>===<br \/><br \/>Night World #5: The Chosen, by L. J. Smith<br \/><br \/>When she's 5 years old, Rashel sees her mother and her friend killed by a vampire. The vampire tries to get her as well, but even at 5 she's strong enough to resist his mind control. Fast forward twelve years and Rashel is a vampire hunter, existing on the fringes of the Day and the Night worlds, keeping humans safe.<br \/><br \/>Rashel is a very strong character, comfortable in her body and determined because of her past. She's a great fighter and has a sense of honor. When she and a group of vampire hunters capture a vampire, the others want to torture him, but Rashel can't stomach torturing a defenseless being, even if he is a vampire. So she decides to let him go...and then discovers he's her soulmate. To add to the mix, the vampire is Quinn, known throughout the Night World as one of the most soulless, human-hating vampires around.<br \/><br \/>While Rashel is one of my favorite Night World characters, I find the plot of this book a little weak. Rashel stumbles into a Night World slave trade of humans when she rescues a blonde bunny, but then Daphne, the girl she helps, is willing to risk her life to help Rashel take down the operation. The ending is very abrupt as well, without taking care of some loose ends that I would've liked to see resolved. But overall \"The Chosen\" fits very nicely into the Night World series, and uses the soulmate principle that ties all the books together very nicely. Rashel and Quinn are iconic of the opposites attract cliche, but it works for them and they grow over the short time period of the book. I really want to see more of them.<br \/><br \/>3\/5.<br \/><br \/>===<br \/><br \/>Night World 6: Soulmate, by L. J. Smith<br \/><br \/>Hannah Snow has the perfect life - she's about to graduate from high school, she already has a college scholarship, and she even knows that she wants to be a paleontologist. But her perfect life starts to collapse when she finds notes that she doesn't remember writing, warning her of a dire event - \"Dead Before Seventeen.\"<br \/><br \/>Increasingly disturbed by the notes and bad dreams, Hannah visits a psychiatrist. On her very first appointment, a werewolf crashes into the building and tries to attack her, but a mysterious voice in her head helps her dodge each claw swipe. She's saved by the arrival of a second werewolf, who chases off the first.<br \/><br \/>Knowing that she has to get to the root of what's going on, Hannah and the psychiatrist try hypnosis, and she's plunged into a vision of a past life, where she was Hana, and a strange boy with blood around his mouth appears in her village...<br \/><br \/>Thierry is one of the oldest vampires in the world, created at the dawn of humanity. He's spent his lifetime searching for his soulmate, trying to find her before her 17th birthday so he can break a cycle of death. But when he finds her this time, she doesn't want his help...<br \/><br \/>\"Soulmate\" is my favorite Night World book. Coming 6th in the series, it exemplifies the soulmate principle Smith has used in each previous book, because Hannah and Thierry are the original soulmates. Hannah's past lives are a great plot device, because it allows Smith to give her lots of growth and abilities; and I really enjoy the stories of her past lives. I wish Smith had done more with that, she alludes to some interesting incarnations of Hannah but only fills in a few. Like other Night World heroines, Hannah's no wilting flower and she does take matters into her own hands when she needs to. Also in \"Soulmate\" Smith starts to introduce a bigger theme if classic theme, saving the world, and it'll be interesting to see where she takes it.<br \/><br \/>If you read any of the other in the Night World series, this book will also give a good update on what your favorite couples are up to, and what they are trying to do.<br \/><br \/>4\/5."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Poor book","text":"This is a book by a person who clearly has no real world experience in the word of digital forensic investigations.<br \/>While the information is relevant; it should not be used as an authoritative text.<br \/>There are much better titles and this should be used as a text of last resort."},{"label":-1,"rating":3.0,"title":"For pet owners with limited knowledge","text":"I had high hopes that this book would be full of wonderful, natural ideas given the author.

He also spends far too much time detailing the life and works of people composer Aaron Copland and blues artist Blind Willie McTell who aren't necessarily thought of as influences on Mr. Dylan's work, but that Mr. Wilentz makes the arguement that they really are.  That being said Mr. Wilentz is a long time fan of Mr. Dylan and he attended several famous Dylan concerts that he recalls in the book.

When I purchased this book, I wasn't sure if I'd keep it or hand it off to a friend with a new dog, but it's not useful for either of us.<br \/>First off, it's not a true guide book. There's ONE dog friendly hike listed per state. ONE. With almost no resources on how to find more. No mention of state specific trail finding sites\/apps or even AllTrails. Did Jen even do her research or consider the needs of her audience?<br \/>She's doling out dog training advice like a trainer without being a trainer. She has no credentials to be doing so and should not be doing so. Giving advice on dog reactivity through a book, especially when you aren't a trainer, is dangerous and, frankly, quite stupid. And her advice for finding a trainer via social media and Google? Come ON. Anyone worth their salt would know to point people towards a site like IACP or another place where people can find trainers who have been reviewed by other trainers instead of by their Instagram and Facebook buddies. This is another thing that tells me she really doesn't know what she's talking about on the training front.<br \/>And then the minimal actual hiking advice... What about the info one needs for truly exploring the backcountry and not just the highly trafficked trails near home? What should folks do when they encounter a bull moose, mountain goat, or black bear with their dog? How about a group with a pack mule or a group of people on horseback? What's the etiquette around dirt bikes and ATVs? Where can we find rattlesnake aversion training and where is that necessary? How much more of an effect do my dogs have on wildlife off leash vs on leash and how should I make the choice to leash or not leash them based on where I am, even where there are no leash rules? These are all things I've encountered and had to consider while traveling with my dogs, and I'm not even an extreme traveler!<br \/>This book literally only skims the surface of a few topics and doesn't offer any worthwhile information on any of them. This is all info I can easily find for free online!<br \/>When you look at the acknowledgements, it's easy to tell WHY this book is trash. The credentials for nearly every contributor are their Instagram handles. That's right. This book was written by Instagrammers for Instagrammers. Heck, there's even a chunk in the book about taking photos FOR Instagram and it makes me sick to my stomach that Jen is feeding into the frenzy of being outdoorsy for social media clout.

It's dangerous to write such a review, because you expose yourself to the charge of, 'You just didn't get it, you cretin.'  I admit that both aspects of that statement may be true, but I didn't get Jonathan Dee's latest book, &#34;The Locals.&#34;<br \/><br \/>Dee's latest novel takes on the American sense of untethered isolation in the wake of 9-11.  Using shifting perspectives that jump with alarming frequency - kind of like the evil demon in the Denzel Washington movie &#34;Fallen,&#34; who jumps from person to person with a tap on the shoulder, the novel's perspective jumps quickly from character to character - Dee gets inside the lives of a bunch of small town Massachusetts residents.  And everyone is more or less unhappy, bitter, and irritated with everyone else.<br \/><br \/>The opening chapter - essentially a prologue - sets the tone.  The narrator for this chapter is a young jerk looking to benefit from a class action lawsuit while covering up his legal issues arising from his . . . indiscretions.  What becomes clear is that, even though he is in Manhattan hours after the 9\/11 attacks, he couldn't care less - he's just out for himself and he sees everyone else in the world as a waste of space.  This sets an unsettling tone for the rest of the book, which I suppose is more or less the point.<br \/><br \/>The 'hero' of this story, Mark Firth, bumps into the prologue narrator as he is also looking to get some money from the class action lawsuit - a bunch of folks have been victimized by a complex swindle.  A contractor in Howland, Massachusetts, Mark has bungled his family's finances, and while everyone back home is initially elated that he survived 9\/11, Mark is all too aware of his family's precarious financial straits.  But he finds a potential windfall when an eccentric millionaire moves to town and hires Mark to do a bunch of seemingly needless work at his home.<br \/><br \/>I'll leave further plot details to others and for you to discover, but the overall point of the story is that life in Howland is rather unpleasant.  The town is not thriving, and people seem motivated more by jealousy and frustration than anything else.  The plot - involving development and small-town politics - moves so slowly that it is secondary to both character and setting.  And neither the characters nor the setting ever become all that interesting.  Again, perhaps this is me, but if I want to hear about petty jealousies and frustrations, I can see plenty of those in my daily life.  There is nothing in this book that takes these petty issues to a more interesting place or puts a sufficiently comic spin on them to make &#34;The Locals&#34; that interesting.<br \/><br \/>Dee is a respected writer, so this review probably says more about me than about him.

No, this seemed as though it was something straight out of the old legends, and I was looking forward to it very much.<br \/><br \/>And then I started reading. There were many scenes in which the pronouns were confused. It was difficult to follow which \u201cshe\u201d or \u201chim\u201d was being referred to. And then it got worse. The thing is, though \u2013 I do a great deal of work in assisting writers for whom English is a second language in polishing their work, sounding more American, or English, depending on where their target audience is. This book read as though someone stuck it in Google Translate and then never bothered to polish it, to edit it, to give it the attention it deserved. It is for this reason that it gets two stars, not one, because it doesn\u2019t appear to be the author\u2019s fault that the story comes across in this manner. But it does make the story very unreadable.<br \/><br \/>Ultimately, I gave up on reading it, because I wasn\u2019t quite sure who was still alive, who was dead, and who was changed. It would be akin to saying that George, John, Paul, and Ringo walked into a bar, he got a soda, he got a beer, he got a basket of pretzels, and he got a whiskey, with each of those things being pertinent to the story, yet never knowing who got what or, subsequently, who choked on a peanut. All in all, if done with a proper editor, this could probably be a very good story. Unfortunately, it just didn\u2019t end up there in the hands of the current editor."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Less than","text":"Says basic and intermediate what arrived was just a bls.

It did not convey as much wretchedness about the Congo as I had anticipated from reviews, but rather just showed the cultural difference between a European sailor and the natives of the Congo. Questionably ignorant, the way that Conrad phrases his understanding seems akin to someone who both does not understand the primitive nature of racism and also someone who does not value anyone differently.

The authors certainly love their acronyms. The glossary placed at the end of the book should be at the beginning. There is some attempt here to explore a few characters in a little depth and examine some geopolitical insights. But it doesn't really work well. This is fundamentally a good guys versus bad guys shoot-em-up story, with a little who-does-what-to-who spy mystery included. The protagonist is very hard to figure out. Partly, an old follow-orders soldier with no personal life, partly a crusader trying to rescue the damsel in distress, part super-heroic combat leader. The combat action is the star here. Lots of unreal elements found. The key agency has unlimited budget, equipment, resources, tech, weapons, etc. Yet remains completely secret from everyone in the US Government (except for one man) including all the other spy agencies and military branches. And all the other spy agencies in the world (except one) are completely oblivious to and uninvolved in the major events portrayed.

She was, in fact, downright likable throughout most of the novel, in spite of the hocus-pocus witchcraft storyline.  And while I did not like Gregory's The Red Queen and have not ever cared for Margaret Beaufort, it was interesting to see how the author switched gears rather believably in her portrayal of Henry VII's mother between her own novel (The Red Queen) and this one.  I appreciated that the witchcraft, while alluded to in the initial encounter between Edward and Elizabeth, was not given any weight when it came to the love and relationship between the two of them. I am normally a stickler for reading a series in order, but in the case of this one, it did not really make a difference (partly due to my extensive familiarity with the characters from other texts).  If you omit The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter, the other four are pleasantly enjoyable -- enough character development to make the characters believable, and Gregory gets her historical details right when it really matters, as well as keeping  the &#34;bodice-ripper&#34; content of these to a blessedly lesser degree than I have run across in some of her other works."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Challenging Read, Would Benefit from Illustrations","text":"If you are looking for a Mars colonization story that covers every aspect of what such an endeavor might look like, down to the level of finest detail, this is the trilogy for you. Everything is described, including but not limited to: the tools used for building and fixing various elements; how the colonists shower; chemical compounds they have to manufacture to create concrete and other materials; and a healthy dose of love interests and \"office politics\". It doesn't quite fit the mode of a \"Space Opera,\" but it is ambitious in what it attempts to convey, both on the level of world building and human interaction.<br \/><br \/>That said, it's a challenging read because the work-up to the main conflict and action takes time. It's fair to say the story would've benefitted from a more aggressive editor, cutting back on some of the exposition and every day dialog. The author wants us to know what it would literally be like to live and work on Mars with a collection of strong personalities, but the truth is as readers, it's better to be spared some of the more mundane or tiresome details. Making a work of fiction too much like real life, is not necessarily a virtue.<br \/><br \/>What would also benefit the story are a few well-placed illustrations or line drawings, showing us (instead of telling us) what some of the complex habitats, rovers, and other components actually looked like. It can be difficult to actually picture the things the author talks about at points. In fact, at points I felt this work might be better experienced as a trilogy of 2-3 hour movies or an HBO mini-series, marrying the detailed story with some impressive visuals.<br \/><br \/>Overall the quality of story-telling is good but I've rated this three stars for the amount of effort required to get through, and the lack of visuals where warranted."},{"label":-1,"rating":3.0,"title":"No depth and mostly action, makes for a dull book.","text":"I can just barely give this 3 stars, and that mostly because Tim does try to humanize a couple of his characters.

The book is set up by tour stop, moving from LA to the New York eventually<br \/>- The relationship between Jonny, and his mother, Jane, seems to be what I'd imagine it to be when a parent has taken control of their child's career. She wants to the best for him, but she also wants the best for her business... which just so happens to be her child...<br \/>- Getting into Jonny's psyche and seeing his struggle between wanting fame and a regular childhood makes him a very sympathetic character. You have to wonder how many of these poor child stars are absolutely miserable and feel forced into their insane schedules.<br \/>- My favorite character was definitely the bodyguard Walter, the most down-to-earth character in the novel. He genuinely cared for Jonny, protecting him from dangers and trying to give him some tidbits of normalcy.<br \/><br \/>Negatives:<br \/>- I thought the \"find my father\" subplot was weakly developed.<br \/>- The book lacks the depth it could have; at times I thought this on-the-surface aspect was actually a trick, that the reader had to look further to really see the depth.

It focuses on the different ethnic groups in Puerto Rico, and on its customs and traditions (e.g. dance, music, folklore, etc.). The language is accessible for 4th to 6th graders. The book is quite informative, but it is not meant to be an in-depth study of a culture. It is merely an introduction to it.<br \/><br \/>However, in spite of its encyclopedic approach, there are minor setbacks. I don't think that Puerto Rican historians were consulted. The text says on page 9 that Puerto Rico obtained its independence from Spain. Such thing never happened. There is a serious omission on black slavery, only mentioned in a couple of lines. And although I'm aware that this book is not meant to give a deep coverage on history, the editors strolled through important events, such as the Spanish-American War, the Foraker Act, and the Jones Act, this latter law, which gave Puerto Ricans American citizenship. Next, carelessness is noted when the editors claim that the Protestant Church in PR split in other sects such as Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons. These two religions were never offshoots of Protestant Churches. I use it in the classroom to teach reading comprehension skills using culturally relevant material, but I have to do my own research to ensure that the content is accurate.

Main character Kate's first person narrative twists and turns acting as a 24\/7 commentary on \"a day in the life\" of a ballerina.  While this would certainly appeal to anyone who has secretly or outwardly coveted tutus, point shoes or just has a gold ballet slipper charm on a nostalgic bracelet, Howrey adds mental stress to Kate's already precariously balanced sense of physical and psychological well-being by injecting a more-talented yet less stable sister for whom Kate feels a mixture of envy, compassion and guilt.<br \/><br \/>All of the siblings of the Crane family have risen to be some sort of performance stars.  Brother Keith, a professional tennis player, calls his family from tennis circuit destinations from around the world.  Gwen, the other ballerina, dances with such ease, she immediately is placed in a starring role.  In fact, she seems to do everything with her own particular effortless grace, including moving in on Kate's boyfriends, sleeping with them, and calling them her own.  Is there any wonder that Kate would feel some impetus to not only be successful but to excel beyond normal expectations?  Kate's opportunity to become a principal comes only when Gwen's instability challenges her very sanity; Gwen is hospitalized and Kate takes her place on the stage.  Her success is tinged with feelings of regret, guilt and the sense of being second best.<br \/><br \/>As Kate goes about her daily routine of classes and performances, her mind floods with thoughts of her sister.  She knows she should view her with compassion yet her need to be a star in her own right revels in her sister's absence.  When Kate hurts her neck while performing in Swan Lake (which will call to mind [[ASIN:B0041KKYEM Black Swan]]), her subsequent dependence on drugs along with the normal stresses of sustaining the athleticism of her ballet, the knowledge that a career of dance is ephemeral and her insecurity with herself reign supreme in her mind and she begins to spiral down the same black hole as her sister.<br \/><br \/>Howrey, once a member of a ballet company herself, presents the disjointed world of ballet and performance art in general, for the competitive microcosm that it is.  However difficult it may be to follow Kate's narrative at times as it wanders with her mind in a circuitous Crane's Dance (Howrey's allusion to Theseus's movements in and out of the Minotaur's Labyrinth), her voice rings true and a view of this world from the inside is revealed warts and all.  In terms of a compelling story, however, the disjointedness of Kate's emotional unravelling as detailed by her mind calling up past and present moments can be confusing and does stop the flow of the actual plot.<br \/><br \/>Kate's relationship with a young ballerina wannabe is especially poignant; she is flattered by Bryce's fascination with her, but is reluctant to push her into a life of grueling routine, insecurity and ephemeral success.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line?  \"The Crane's Dance\" by Meg Howrey gives an insider's perspective of ballet.  Impeded by her sister's emotional collapse, main character Kate finds the strenuous world of dance overwhelming.  At times, Howrey's narration seems disjointed even when it follows the track of the main character's mind.

If Satan is under the complete dominion of God, then why is his name Satan which means \"adversary\". I'm sure that God prevents Satan and his demons from inflicting more harm than they wish to, but to say they are under the complete dominion of God is confusing and misleading.

I liked Jessamy, but found her to have a bit of the \"waiting lady in distress\" thing which I'm not the biggest fan of.  I think where Singh shines is in full length novels (I also read her Psy series) because she had a chance to fully develop her characters and story.  In novellas she tries, but I can almost feel where she would have written more in but didn't do to space constraints (like when Jessamy goes back to the Refuge).

Had some of these moments taken me by surprise, I can imagine that my feelings for the novel would be much stronger. A good twist really forces you to re-consider everything you've read up to that moment, and in a sense, lengthens the intellectual content. And while someone said in another review that this book is the perfect example of an unreliable narrator, I disagree. The narrator here, Mary-Catherine Blackwood, is indeed totally unreliable, no question, but this is a known quantity from the start. Trusting a narrator of this caliber is foolish and would obviously lead you down the wrong path. Not trusting the narrator, which I didn't from the get go, makes for a less passive read, but alas, a clearer one in which the surprises aren't surprises.

Russel was staying with Brenna, so why would he have to drive out somewhere to meet Peggy Sue to get the present? Why did Peggy Sue not want to give it to Brenna herself? Which Brenna later claimed that she did receive the gift on Christmas Day (but who brought it?).<br \/><br \/>p 188 \"I fought back and sassed my half sister, Sue.\" Should be stepsister.<br \/><br \/>p 189 \"Peggy was a chubby child, and Doris watched her closely, fearful that her beautiful baby girl might truly become fat. Peggy was allergic to eggs and chocolate, and she had to be on a special diet. Instead of milk, she drank Strawberry Quik.\" Strawberry Quik  is a flavored powder (full of sugar) which is mixed with milk, so yes, Peggy Sue did drink milk. Not sure what Strawberry Quik had to do with her \"special diet\" or how it helped her from becoming \"truly fat.\"  \"Peggy had sugar-free candy because she was allergic to chocolate.\" There are MANY candies which do not contain chocolate. Maybe Doris gave her sugar-free to keep her from becoming \"truly fat.\" And could none of the other children have Strawberry Quik, only Peggy?<br \/><br \/>p 194 Jimmie and Doris divorced (when?) and both remarried in 1984. Amy was so upset about divorce she lost control of mother's car on the way to high school one morning and wrecked it. Amy was four in 1963, so she would have been eighteen in 1977. So it had to have happened 1975-1977 - was that when the divorce was?<br \/><br \/>p 195 \"Rob....joined the navy right out of high school.\" \"...shortly after he was mustered out of the service...\" why was he mustered out?<br \/><br \/>p 200 Sweet Sue's wedding - \"her half sisters were happy to attend.\" They were STEP sisters.

Was it really THE present? Who did she say BROUGHT her the gift?<br \/><br \/>p 170 Jimmie was a big rugged man with wavy, red blond hair....\"<br \/>p 187 \"He [Jimmie] had always had flaming red hair...\"<br \/>Was it red blond or was it flaming red?<br \/><br \/>p 194 \"Shortly after High School Graduation Amy married Mr. DeBoer...\" She couldn't even find out Mr. DeBoer's first name?<br \/><br \/>According to Ann Rule, Peggy's second husband Kelvin Thomas, despite cheating on Peggy, \"always had her back.\" How so?

Over and over we must be told that Jean Huden took drugs. Over and over we must be told that there were SIX children from the first marriage of Peggy Sue's father, and her mother had TWO, so that made EIGHT children.<br \/><br \/>The book is poorly written and confusing. Some of the paragraphs have sentences that don't even belong in those paragraphs, or the sentences themselves were confusing. There are a lot of exclamation points used in the dialogue, and in Ms. Rules own observations or opinions. Some of content, especially Peggy Sue's resume, appears to be lifted straight from newspaper articles. It would be interesting to find out the neurosis that possessed Peggy to destroy her marriage to Mark Allen. That was like killing the goose that laid the golden egg. It must have been control and power that she wanted, and she had such a huge ego she thought she could have all that and the money too. Unfortunately for her, Mark Allen did not care to be controlled.<br \/><br \/>I don't know if Russel was a bad guy or not. His wife said he was. His mother did not seem impressed with him. He threw a fit because his store did not have Mountain Dew and he wore a kilt to work one day and a sarong on another day, seeming to think that would be okay in a business environment.

She\u2019s lost her unborn child, husband, and job due to her addictions.  Alex is grasping every last straw on a road to redemption and feels a connection to Amy and her untold story.  Alex is such an alcoholic that she wears diapers to bed because she blacks out so completely at night that she wakes to having wet the bed.  Yet she\u2019s supposed to be able to launch an investigation into a 15 year old case and solve Amy\u2019s case.  Not. Gonna. Happen.<br \/><br \/>The one redeeming quality of the novel is actually the writing.  For a story that misses it\u2019s mark - it\u2019s actually well written.  Every novelist has a novel that fails to deliver and I\u2019m hoping this is Holly Seddons.  I would look forward to reading another of her works with hope that the story was a better one.<br \/><br \/>Try Not to Breath is buzzing about the literary world with a lot of hype in its wake.  Sadly, it just doesn\u2019t deliver. The characters are improbable and unlikable. The story has a lot of potential but it never quite makes it to the goal of being an interesting and well told.

Post apocalyptic? CHECK. Bond between father and son? YEP. Cannibalism? ... Kinda...<br \/><br \/>The writing is an acquired taste. In fact, I started it, then put it down for a couple of weeks, then picked it back up and finished it. If you're a fairly decent reader with good apprehension, you can knock this out in a couple of hours easily. And that's even re-reading a few spots where you just go &#34;huh....?&#34; The writing is good in that it is very poetic in the way he describes the character's feelings and what they are seeing. But it is not &#34;writing&#34; as you might be accustomed to in a novel. The author skips out on quote marks when character's are talking, so there's not a lot of warning that you are shifting into &#34;conversation&#34; mode. Which is ok and easy to adjust to. But he also selectively leaves out punctuation. And that gets a bit annoying. There are lengthy descriptions of some things that you might not find important, and short anti-climactic run ins with danger where you wish he'd elaborated.<br \/><br \/>And as for the cannibalism... the movie goes into more detail on that than the book. I was hoping for some Swan Song-esque violent run ins with gangs. I got &#34;Oh gosh... there are some people. Let's hide. Okay. We hid. They left. We can go.&#34;. If you want your characters to ever be in any peril, other than potentially starving to death, this might not be the type of novel you are looking for. It just doesn't really get the heart-rate up as you panic on behalf of the characters. It feels a little like &#34;Cast Away&#34; did to me; Yes, it's entertaining, but honestly it's also a bit boring.<br \/><br \/>I WILL SAY that I cried like a damn baby at the end. Oh my goodness.

This hefty volume includes commentary from almost all the surviving writers, cast members and many guest hosts. Also, much space is devoted to memories of John Belushi, Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, and others who had not survived to 2003 when this book was published. This book's style may not be the easiest to follow, although I had no real problem. I think it highlights the transitions from one era to the next, for example, the age difference between Nealon, Hartman, etc. and Sandler, Farley, Spade, and Rock in the early nineties exposes a generation gap. What is fresh and hilarious to some is merely \"juvenile\" to others.<br \/><br \/>The most prevalent feeling I came away from reading this was probably envy. These people got to be part of a small fraternity\/sorority that everyone else envies. Bill Murray is quoted saying,\" Having the experience was probably the greatest thing.\"  Instead reading this book is the closest thing to being a fly-on-the- wall I'll ever experience. The show is a pop culture icon, and since it debuted in 1975, there's much territory to cover.  The book allots large space for the first legendary cast and especially Lorne Michaels. You might argue with that, but I won't. Shales and Miller definitely give you and appreciation for Michaels, love him or hate him his show has stood the test of time.<br \/><br \/>The book is long. It deserved more editing in my opinion, although any fan could pick out cast members, characters, or even eras that deserved more space.

I appreciated the organization (addressing a different area each month) as well as the foundation in research on happiness and well-being.<br \/><br \/>I was hoping that Rubin's next book, BETTER THAN BEFORE, would be a sort of follow-up.  In some ways, it is, this time with Rubin more specifically addressing how to manage habits in order to be more happy and satisfied.  Unfortunately, I didn't like this book nearly as much; in fact, I found it was a slog to get through the whole thing.<br \/><br \/>My major problem with this book is something Rubin addresses in her \"A Note to the Reader\" at the start of the book.  She says \"I see habits through the lens of my own experience, so this account is colored by my particular personality and interests.\"  And that is just it--i.e., Rubin's \"study\" of habits is almost wholly based on what has worked for HER and for people she knows.  Her prior book utilized over-frequent quotes from her blog; this one relies on anecdotal stories from her family and friends.<br \/><br \/>Rubin attempts to make her theories adaptable to all by coming up with a theory of what she calls \"the four tendencies,\" or basically, four different approaches to habits.  She calls these the Upholder, Questioner, Obliger, and Rebel.  I didn't find this model, which Rubin refers to throughout the book, to be at all helpful.  Whereas Rubin may find herself  solidly in the \"Upholder\" category, I personally was divided between Upholder and Questioner, and I didn't really respond to the suggestions for either.<br \/><br \/>Using this basic framework, Rubin goes on to create many, MANY more almost arbitrary categories.  Are you a Lark or an Owl (again, I'm in-between).  A Mararthoner, Sprinter, or Procrastinator?  Underbuyer or Overbuyer?  Simplicity Lover or Abundance Lover?  Finisher or Opener?  Familiarity Lover or Novelty Lover?  Promotion-Focused or Prevention Focused?  Small Steps or Big Steps?  And ALL of that is only in the second chapter!  It felt very bogged down, confusing, and often irrelevant, at least for me.<br \/><br \/>Rubin goes on to address the importance of monitoring habits and to discuss the foundation for creating habits.  There are some solid, general tips in this section.  But eventually, she falls back into creating forced categories, such as the series of \"loopholes,\" or exceptions to habits.  Again, there are some good ideas here and there, but they tend to get lost among the clutter.<br \/><br \/>One of Rubin's chapters is called \"Data Point of One.\"  This is probably the best way to view this book--that is, as one person's experience, with suggestions that may or may not relate personally.  Given both that I don't see an overall general application to Rubin's theories and that I really didn't enjoy this book overall, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Don't bother!","text":"Very disappointed in this book and the sequel.

I loved so much about this book, agreed with most of it and found it very refreshing to have sex and porn discussed so openly and realistically outside of societal judgements.  But I did have one major issue that hindered most of the book for me as it popped up in the beginning.  Writer David J. Ley Ph.D. does not believe in sex addiction or porn addiction. I whole-heartedly disagree.  Yes I believe he is correct when he says often the answer is the problem and answer is not addiction but you.  Simply, you like sex.  That can be true for many but there are also those where the pull to porn or acting out sexually is not really about sex but rather other issues like past abuse and much danger can come to them in life without addressing and understanding these issues.  So I found Ley basically took some taboo subjects and in a fun way gave men permission to enjoy their porn and sex.

She's basically using Wolverine's old vibe.  There aren't a lot of other characters and they are, largely, bland and unremarkable.  There are a couple of big exceptions, but... it wasn't a fun read.  It compares badly with Dresden Files and even Laurell K Hamilton.  There are far better examples of modern fantasy, notably Tim Power's 'Declare', Sean Stewart's 'Perfect Circle', Daryl Gregory's 'We Are All Completely Fine', and 'Finch' by Jeff Vandermeer, which is a little less fantasy and more horror."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"\"Interesting concept but left me wanting more\"","text":"I picked up this book because I thought the concept was interesting, and after reading the first chapter I was hooked, and decided to buy it.

Great school, great friends, great \"family\"...life is good. Except for the fact that she was abandoned as a baby, left with scars on her chest and back. Luckily Haven was taken in and cared for by Joan, a nurse, and her coworkers. When Haven and her best friend Dante, along with classmate Lance, are whisked away for a once-in-a-lifetime internship at a soon to be opened hotel\/nightclub in the Chicago, it's a dream come true.<br \/><br \/>Once the internship begins, the fact that something is \"off\" is quickly evident. Maybe it's the fact that The Outfit, the beyond glamorous staff, act like freakish robots? Or the mysterious book that seems to be communicating with Haven? But how about the fact that Aurelia, her boss, and Lucian, Aurelia's next in command, act plain creepy? When Haven discovers the secrets behind this dangerous group, she faces it head on, determined to save herself and those she loves.<br \/><br \/>Once again, I find myself at odds, opinion-wise, between myself and so many other readers. The cover is beautiful, with the right amount of foreshadowing. A cover like that is sure to put a book on my radar. And a lot of bloggers I know have read ILLUMINATE and have given it glowing reviews. So I was excited to read this one. I was primed and ready to love it. But, it just didn't happen, for several reasons.<br \/><br \/>First, I didn't feel a \"hook\", a strong plot line that grabbed my attention and demand that I read this book. I knew what the hook was supposed to be. It's actually spelled out in the synopsis. The framework was laid out so slowly that I became bored. I knew danger was coming, but I honestly just wanted Haven to get a clue and get on with it. There wasn't this big \"aha\" moment, where things suddenly got real. Everything Haven learned was through eavesdropping and thinly veiled hints during conversations.<br \/><br \/>Another aspect to the story that did not connect with me was the love interest. Upon arrival at the hotel, Haven meets Lucian. Lucian is of course, impossibly gorgeous, wealthy, charming...you know what I'm saying. I just didn't get it. I don't care how hot I am for a guy, if he always cancels dates, disappears for days, and asks me to give him my soul, that's a huge dealbreaker. But maybe that's just me. Not Haven. She falls hard for Lucian and keeps seeing him despite his efforts to damn her for eternity. Sigh. And yes, it may be possible that the devilish Lucian will have a change of heart. Even so, that's a bridge too far to cross, in my opinion.<br \/><br \/>My biggest issue with ILLUMINATE is the fact that the story moved so slowly. Much of the \"action\" was Haven running errands delivering chocolate, or learning the various duties of her position. She did lurk through the tunnels and crawlspaces of the hotel, but not a lot came of it. The revelations, what there were of them, came so slowly that I found myself easily distracted from the story. Even the big events didn't wow me.<br \/><br \/>I know I sound like a complete grouch after writing this (grumble, grumble). That is never my intention. I wanted to love ILLUMINATE. The author does have a nice writing style. The words and dialogue flowed extremely well. The book had some beautiful passages. I liked Haven, Lance and Dante, for the most part. Overall, though, I found ILLUMINATE to be too long and too slow to suit my tastes.<br \/><br \/>Favorite Quote:<br \/><br \/>\"After a thing like that, worry becomes more than a reflex; it becomes an umbrella shadowing daily life, hovering closer every time someone gets home late or doesn't call when they say they will.\"<br \/>(pg.5, ARC)"},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"The Cat Who Should Retire","text":"Hardcore mystery fans may find it a bit of a stretch, but if your taste runs to expertly written and very light fiction, you can't do better than Lillian Jackson Braun's \"The Cat Who...\" series. Her detective, reporter James Qwilleran, investigates crimes with the aid of his Siamese cats--and the solutions to the crime inevitably rest more upon intution than actual deduction. The premise sounds farfetched, but Braun's work is usually less fanciful than you might expect, and she presents her eccentric characters and stories with great charm.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the series has been in marked decline for some time now, and THE CAT WHO WENT BANANAS is a case in point.  On the surface, the plot has possibilities: Qwilleran's interest in a local theatre group's production of THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERNEST opens a path to death that may or may not be accidental.  Unfortunately, the plot goes nowhere and, although the conclusion certainly points to a specific person as a killer, there is no actual resolution per se.  To make matters worse, the prose lacks Braun's light, bemused touch.  While I think it possible that the book has been written from Braun's basic ideas, I think it very unlikely that Braun herself wrote it.  It reeks of \"ghosts.\"<br \/><br \/>This is a tremendous pity, a disservice to both Braun and the reader.  Newcomers to the series should look to earlier works, such as THE CAT WHO CAME TO BREAKFAST or THE CAT WHO MOVED A MOUNTAIN--but the later titles in the series should be avoided like the plauge.<br \/><br \/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Realistic","text":"A very interesting story about life in a Chinese village around the time of the cultural revolution.<br \/><br \/>It runs the gamut of emotions from tender love to gross incidents.<br \/><br \/>Managing the names were difficult for me at times."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"organization","text":"This book is organized by the color of the plants' colors, so if you're trying to identify a plant that's not blooming, it's very difficult to find.

The children of Han and Leia have been kidnapped while Leia is out on a diplomatic mission. Leia feels that somehow the Dark Side of the Force must be involved, though the diplomats she is meeting with suggests that it is just the local custom of kidnapping for social status and that it is part of a local tradition. Leia feels otherwise and she is right. The children are kidnapped by the Lord Hethrir who takes the children and tells them their parents are dead. Somehow he is able to block their limited and young ability to use the Force. Meanwhile Han is on vacation with Luke. Luke is searching for missing Jedi and their travels take them close to a planet which is slowly dying and turning to crystal. This is messing with Luke's ability to sense with the Force and Vonda McIntyre gives the reader a very different spin on Luke Skywalker. Rather than the hero, we have a despondent and sluggish man who is not thinking rationally. It is a different spin on Skywalker and may be disappointing to many readers. Luke is less of a presence in this novel anyway as the focus is more on the kids in captivity and Leia's attempts to rescue them. Luke and Han are almost a side plot which eventually gets pulled into the main storyline as it all comes together in a mess of villainy.<br \/><br \/>My biggest problem with The Crystal Star is that it focused far too much attention on the Solo children. Sure, they will eventually become major players in the Star Wars Universe and sure, the readers needs to be introduced to the characters so they don't just show up one novel as fully formed characters who we have not had the chance to get to know, but I think Anakin is three years old, which would put Jacen and Jaina around five. Unless Anakin is only two. I'm not sure, but they are a bit too young to get such a large role. Roger MacBride Allen did a far better job with the children in the Corellian Trilogy which was only set a year or so after this novel. They're no Ender Wiggin, I'll say that much.<br \/><br \/>After the children my complaints have to do with the storytelling. There is nothing wrong with having Luke's mission go poorly, but everything felt rushed. Leia spent so much time wanting to find her children but not really following them until all of a sudden she knows exactly where they are and the kids and everyone end up in the same place with Han and Luke. Sorry, I guess that is a bit of a spoiler, but come on now. Really? The novel might have been better served by focusing soley on Leia and the children with perhaps a cameo at best of Han and Luke. Not the wasted chapters with no real story development, though we do get a bit of Han's past came to light.<br \/><br \/>Bottom Line: Even fans of the Star Wars novels should skip this one. It does nothing, or little to build on future stories (a minor character or two from this book may appear in future volumes as Jedi) and it does not resolve any ongoing storylines. The book is essentially self-contained and reading a basic summary would be just as enjoyable as reading this novel.<br \/><br \/>-Joe Sherry"},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"SEX Positions?!?!?!?!

On the one hand, the author effectively uses a historical backstory to add interest and to enhance the plot, but on the other, the present-day characters are unlikeable and their seem fairly stereotypical.  Francie and Colt Hart have been married for 7 years, but their bickering has become commonplace.  On a rare weekend drive from their home in NYC to the \"country\"--aka rural Pennsylvannia--they spy an old house with which they both fall in love:  Francie, because it appeals to the poet within, and Colt, because it is a status symbol.  They purchase the house and prepare to move in, but they soon find themselves in trouble with Francie's brother, a new neighbor, and a long-lost relative of Colt's as well.<br \/><br \/>Francie, Colt, and Francie's brother Michael are all irritating characters; it is difficult to root for any one of them in this story.  Each experiences a transformation that is not quite believable given the circumstnaces.  This is even more true for their neighbor, Randy, who acts in a manner which is completely out of character--although this is acknowledged within the book, it still seems unreasonable.  More interesting and engaging are the house's original occupants, the Musgroves, who built Adencourt one hundred and fifty years before.  The author weaves the tale of the Musgroves into that of the Harts through occasional \"historical digressions\" as well as hints sprinkled throughout the house.

I just finished, \u2018White Like Her,\u2019 & well, it took quite a while. I typically get through a book in about 3 hours, but this one just didn\u2019t grip me like most tend to do. It wasn\u2019t bad by any means... it was just rather dry. Perhaps a bit too drawn out with the ins\/outs of research? I can\u2019t put my finger on it yet.<br \/><br \/>Note, I\u2019ve not seen more than a couple episodes of Genealogy Roadshow. I\u2019ve not seen the episode in which the author appears, so I have not a preference towards what aired vs. what\u2019s in the book. Moving on...<br \/><br \/>I found the story\u2019s premise an interesting one. Being a Greek who is the fairest member of the family has put me on the receiving end of the, \u2018What are you?\u2019 question\u2014especially as an awkward looking child. It bothered me then, especially since I didn\u2019t understand what was being asked.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, genealogy itself bores me to tears. I\u2019ve actually attempted to do research, however, as a screenwriter, I tend to gravitate towards stories that jump off the page. I was unable to feel that, save for very specific parts of this book. I felt the author\u2019s longing for questions that will forever go unanswered, at least by the woman she\u2019d most like to answer them. And yet, just like the author, we\u2019re left with enough speculation about people we\u2019ll never know.<br \/><br \/>Trying to follow the family tree of so & so & why they\u2019re important to a person\u2019s personal narrative is likely incredibly interesting to people naturally interested in genealogy, but for someone like me, speculation & bits & pieces of stories fall flat.<br \/><br \/>The author makes some excellent points about the way Americans look at & discuss race. The book also raises plenty of questions that likely will cause the majority of readers to consider as they relate to their own lives & what they (believe?) know vs. the whole truth. In this way, I absolutely find great value in White Like Her.<br \/><br \/>As a memoir that feels as though it breathes new life in to family members long deceased, well, it didn\u2019t strike that chord for me. As an only child with one parent in their final months - year of life & the other affected by Parkinson\u2019s disease, I have been more interested in family memoirs now more than ever before. I wouldn\u2019t change having read this, but I also can\u2019t say I recommend it above many others.<br \/><br \/>If you love genealogy, this is probably a great choice. If you don\u2019t & you\u2019re not interested in trying to follow stories about how someone\u2019s mother passed for white, left her relatives to do so & later her daughter ends up on a quest to tell you why she\u2019s looking for information on her 3rd great grandparent (and giving you seemingly every detail), leave it on the shelf. It may be interesting to some, but most likely the, \u2018some,\u2019 are likely to be related to you.

For many their flight was fueled by boredom, or a desire for adventure and the family conflict was caused by controlling parents or an objectionable romance. Lane Roanoke's flight was caused by much more compelling reasons so when she was summoned back to the family farm she would have refused if her grandfather had not told her that her cousin, Allegra was missing. After Lane returned and began searching for Allegra she found only more dark secrets about her family and the repercussions of those secrets to other innocent lives.<br \/><br \/>There are many excellent aspects of this novel. The characters are interesting, and Lane in particular is quite appealing. The descriptions of the isolated town and claustrophobic small town in Kansas is quite well done. The basic premise of the story is distasteful but is understandable given the setting and characters. The author has used the currently popular technique of telling parallel stories from different points of view and in different times skillfully to tell this story.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately there are also some problems with this novel as well. It seemed obvious to me what was going on in this family long before the novel got there making most of the book rather anti climatic. I also felt there were numerous plot holes in this story.

It took me longer than it should have, in light of the suggested reading time of 5.5 hours. When I'm in the midst of a story that's really working for me, it doesn't take that long. I'm giving it three stars because it was good, but I didn't think it was a terribly clever read. I thought it started badly.  Paragraph one should come with a spoiler alert. I spent at least half the book waiting to see what would happen to Merit Badges after I found out that she was going to pay the price for the signature on the contract with the Russian.  It was just a matter of how many pages I had to turn to get my reward. And that's a shame, because I really like the legal aspect of the book, and I definitely loved the golf interest. But I found myself trying to speed through. Also, the book started badly because I thought the main character had a stupid name. Apparently somebody in publishing likes it because there's a whole series of books with Merit in them. That being said, I thought the main character was well developed and generally a pretty smooth character. I enjoyed some of the less easily anticipated turns in the story - such as who the &#34;Enforcer&#34; turned out to be.  And I also appreciated the main character being an intelligent woman who was not really judged by the younger man she kept company with. I thought the title of the book was smart, appealing and a great indication of what the book is really about.  Mark Green's flashback was a flashback for me too.  Did I read that twice? It felt like the 18th hole was a rerun. Did Betty and Bob Tom (another stupid name) ever hook up? Where did that go? If you like golf, you'll be more interested in that aspect of the story then some of the other parts."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"SOOOO Misleading!","text":"There are indeed a number of gorgeous hats to LOOK AT in this book. There are only 10 of them TO KNIT. Why? The author picked her favorite 10 from the 1000 she shows and gives the patterns for those. As it happens, I hated all the ones she picked. Regardless of whether you agree with the author's taste or not, it is almost deceitful not to say that you are only giving patterns for 1% of the hats whose pictures you show in the book. I was going to buy this from amazon. Luckily I stumbled upon it in a physical bookstore. Was that lucky or what! Saved myself and amazon the trouble of me buying it and having to return it (as I certainly would have done after I'd seen what was (or wasn't!)inside)."},{"label":0,"rating":2.0,"title":"Pretty Book, Ugly Message","text":"Although this is a pretty book, featuring art work in warm, vibrant colors normally associated with Mexico, the message is objectionable. The free form verse is based on statements made by the artist Diego Rivera which they concede may or may not be true. The author advances Rivera's embrace of communism  and violence as the only alternatives to  vicious and tyrannical  leadership. The tacit approval of terrorism is genuinely offensive, especially in light of the brutality experienced at the Boston Marathon. The verse brags on page 20 that he \"blew up trains\" and bemoans his failed assassination attempt on the then Mexican president. Moreover his treatment of women leaves much to be desired. Apparently it is fine to lie and cheat and have multiple affairs while married. Rivera certainly was not designed for fatherhood, telling his partner at one point he will throw the child out the window if it disturbs him.<br \/><br \/>It is a pity that this book is not focused on what made him famous, his art. It is unfortunate that the author did not use his life as an opportunity to discuss the more challenging elements including politics, poverty and morality. Instead there is just blanket approval.  The verses focus on many ugly things, the deaths of babies, throwing the baby artist in a dung bucket. Instead of focusing on matters relevant to children today such as the importance of following dreams, making a difference, being kind, not judging on appearances, the author opts for pro left propaganda. This is not a book I would give to children."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"A Thoughtful Discussion","text":"The last time I went to my primary care physician I told her I'd been sick with the flu for a few days but had cured myself by taking capsules of oregano oil. I was completely well when I saw her so imagine my surprise when a few days later my local pharmacy called me to inform me that I should pick up my prescription. I had not asked for one so I thought this was very strange. I told them to cancel the order for antibiotics since I didn't need them. The only reason I went to my doctor in the first place was because I needed a refill for my thyroid mediation which I ordered through a website. So what was my doctor thinking? I have no idea! So when I was offered a copy of this book I said yes, because obviously my doctor and I are having communication problems.<br \/><br \/>This book encourages the patient\/reader to be a self-advocate. This book is about patient empowerment. It immediately addresses the frustration most of us feel when we go to the doctor and can't talk about all our issues.

There is also some information on why patients should be more willing to talk about embarrassing or difficult issues.<br \/><br \/>If you are interested in this book then I can also recommend another excellent book on the subject: [[ASIN:0981524036 The Take-Charge Patient: How You Can Get the Best Medical Care]]<br \/><br \/>~The Rebecca Review<br \/><br \/>I received this book free for review.

I also hate the changing POV, because I find it stressful to be left hanging on a plot line.  I find myself flipping throught the book to find the resolution to the problem, rather than trying to move on to the next plot line.  Of all the characters, Kate's story was the most compelling.  I'd have rather read the entire book from her POV.  I have been reading this book for a long time, because it's one of those you can get sick of, rather than propelling you to read it cover to cover.  I did find the story interesting though.

The author presents very well the readings and writings about the war in the 50 years that followed it, and about the underlying social factors and desires that made reconciliation along with true racial equality either impossible or simply unattained.

Much of the narrative consists of factual descriptions of geographical locations in Japan and (to a lesser extent) San Francisco, of forensic suspect-sketching techniques, of &#34;nuclear mafia&#34; groups and nations, of potentially poisonous fugu blowfish dishes, and of Japanese Oribe ceramic art.<br \/><br \/>The plot itself is a superficial private-detective procedural, with action scenes pretty much limited to investigator Jim Brodie's personal martial arts encounters with a Japanese assassin, some FBI\/CIA\/HAS strongmen, and a District of Columbia &#34;fixer&#34;.  The story skips quite discreetly over Brodie's &#34;action&#34; with his new girlfriend Ries.  Rather distressingly, Brodie seems quite indifferent to the deaths of various policemen and bodyguard employees who lose their lives while guarding Brodie and\/or his clients.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Brodie (a San-Francisco-based Japanese art dealer and half-owner of an inherited Tokyo private security firm), is called to a Napa Valley crime scene to translate the chanting of a Japanese child whose father has just been murdered.  The victim turns out to be the son of Brodie's artist friend Ken Nobuki, who is due to arrive soon in San Francisco to kick off an international art trading agreement, the Pacific Rim Friendship Program (PRFP).  There is no obvious motive for the murder.<br \/><br \/>When exiting an inaugural PRFP meeting at San Francisco's City Hall, Brodie and Nobuki are pinned down by a sniper's fire from atop the nearby Asian Art Museum.  Brodie escapes without injury, but Nobuki is shot in the head and is hospitalized for the duration of the novel.  After Brodie thwarts an assassin's attempt to finish off Nobuki at the hospital, Brodie arranges for protection of Nobuki's daughter Naomi, an anti-nuclear-power agitator who is in Washington, DC.  Naomi may be targeted for death by the Japanese &#34;nuclear mafia&#34; that has been white-washing the Fukushima nuclear power disaster and making only cosmetic changes to the management of nuclear power facilities in the aftermath of the disaster.<br \/><br \/>Brodie then flies to Japan--leaving his young daughter with a neighbor at very short notice--and sets the employees of Brodie Security to work on protecting Nobuki's family members and on identifying the reasons behind the apparent ongoing attempt to wipe out the entire Nobuki family.  Brodie shows himself to be quite oblivious to personal danger, even though his firm's reputation (and that of its employees) hinges on his remaining alive.<br \/><br \/>Although the story's ending is somewhat surprising, the plot usually just plods along, following Brodie's investigative activities and his martial arts fights.  Brodie's character is rather thin--his fatherly thoughts and arrangements for his daughter's upbringing and safety aren't particularly convincing, and his background doesn't seem to fully support his awesome martial arts prowess.  In fact,  I didn't like Brodie well enough to want to read the other series books, even though I'm generally a sucker for any mystery\/thriller with a San Francisco Bay Area setting.  For all of the above reasons, I rate PACIFIC BURN at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale)."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Not entertaining at all","text":"This book moves at a snails pace and the ability to put it down and never pick it back up is throughout.

But even given my level of &#34;ignorance&#34;, I found the author's constant intermixing of information (often conflicting) obtained via official documents with undocumented witness statements and recollections, not to mention statements and recollections of relatives & friends of these purported witnesses, as well as his (the author's) personal speculations, to be neither educational or enjoyable.  I did gain one thing from the book, however - an interest in learning more about the apparently complex, and somewhat eccentric, woman behind the throne, Tsarina Alix.

However, when something bad happened her dreams were over and she didn't make it. Her best friend did though. Jasmine didn't just make the team. She also married their coach.

The unusual main character which has a very mixed cultural background brought a lot to this story, in my opinion, making in unique in yet another way.<br \/><br \/>Impressive descriptions of the city and the especially the shops led the way to interesting connections with the family at the centre of this novel. I particularly liked the good vs. evil feeling of a character more or less struggling to gain control over their own demons.<br \/><br \/>I did feel that this book had steep drop offs where the every day actions of the characters took over the story for pages at a time. The novel redeemed itself whenever something exciting would happen, but there are some rather long stretches where nothing much is going on.<br \/><br \/>The author does a good job of painting a background for her characters that is both believable and enticing. She raises questions about them throughout this novel, never answering them all at the end. There is definitely room for another book, if one has not been written already.<br \/><br \/>Some liberties were certainly taken with the rearranging of facts and dates to accommodate the needs of the writer, but I think for the most part it worked pretty well.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I thought this was an intriguing story and a book that fans of Gothic literature will be happy to check out for themselves.<br \/><br \/>This review is based on a complimentary copy from Netgalley and the publisher."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Good Content, Terrible Production Value","text":"Great tool but terrible production quality.

But I sure was surprised to see an error, especially since it was a chapter heading. It looks like real research wasn't done but just copied for other places where original errors were made. It concerns the quote that the Sonic actually began in Stillwater rather than in Shawnee as it actually did. The authors are correct in that the first SIGN reading &#34;Sonic&#34; did appear in Stillwater but the first drive-in restaurant itself was definitely in Shawnee. And the Top Hat, as it says in the book, was not a chain. There was one little drive-in hamburger joint in Shawnee in front of a restaurant, the Log House, and owned by the same two guys, Troy Smith and Joe McKimmey. They started their venture about 1954. Troy wanted to concentrate on the drive-in and use a new concept he'd seen in California, the electronic speaker. Joe wanted to stick with the restaurant so the he bought out Troy. They couldn't use the Top Hat name because they discovered a couple of others places already named that, which had nothing to do with Troy's business, so he coined the name &#34;Sonic.&#34; He was building the one in Shawnee when he also bought a place in Stillwater and they got the first &#34;signage.&#34; In 1959 through early '60s both the Top Hat and the Sonic were in existence. I know this because my dad was a one time law partner with Joe McKimmey who was going to law school while he ran the Log House restaurant.

Much of the information is based upon the mysterious and controversial Memorialum Commercatoris manuscript, supposedly written by a Zbigniew Stefanski, alleged to have been one of the original Jamestown Poles. As the story goes, an individual offered to sell the privately published manuscript to the Polish Museum of Chicago, where Waldo was able to view it. We're told the deal ultimately fell through and the mysterious manuscript was withdrawn, never to be seen again. Polish American historians have their serious doubts about the veracity of Waldo's account of this missing manuscript and its contents.<br \/><br \/>From this extremely dubious source Waldo presents the names and backgrounds of the Jamestown Poles, their experiences as glassmakers, homebuilders, and well-diggers along with an account of the Poles saving settlement leader, Captain John Smith, from an Indian attack.

It focuses on a 17 year old girl whose mother has been dead a few years and is going to stay with her aunt and cousins for her seventeenth year (last year of high school). Shes very focused on boys, sex, more boys, and so on.<br \/>When she gets to her aunts one of the first thing she thinks of is the boy next door. She hasn't seen him for years but she has the biggest crush on him and when she sees him she is almost instantly \"in love\" with him. After a whole lot of flirting she finds out he has a girlfriend. So she's bummed about that. She's lost her last best friend when her boyfriend kissed her and, well, lets just say this book has a lot of boy craziness! That aside there are a few, or at least one, friendship in the book and maybe a lesson is learned in it somewhere. I will admit, I wasn't a fan of the main character at the end of the book. Even for their ages, some things are just a bit unlikeable. However, there really is a lot to like about this book!

Mia hadn't, but suddenly finds herself with a kingdom to rule. If you expect the book Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot to resemble the movie, to actually show her dealing with being a princess, think again. This is just another teen romance, and not a very good one at that, and should stay on the shelves.<br \/><br \/>True, I admit that I saw the movie first and so came to the book with certain expectations. For example, I envisioned reading about how tough becoming a princess can be for us average people but how sweet Mia overcomes the challenge with awkwardness and humor. I also anticipated reading pages upon pages about how Mia is trained in all the proper royal etiquette such as how to sit, walk, dance, dress, and talk. Next, despite how cliche the plotline sounds, I expected Mia to eventually endear herself to her the royal staff, incite the jealousy of popular students, and develop closer bonds with true friends. I wanted the story I saw on screen.<br \/><br \/>Yet sometimes a book is better than the movie. And so I think I could have lived with a different book, if not for all its flaws. From page one until the end, Mia complains about her life. In this way Mia is like the girl we see on the screen, except in the book she also swears, lies about most everything, and basically just seems more crude. She also struggles in school, frequently copies her homework off others, and disdains most of her teachers. She likes to shop, wants to be popular, and does not have any interest in doing anything with her life except to date. While these may be on the top of the list for many girls, the emphasis on them in the book makes it difficult for me to believe that she would have the ability to be a princess.<br \/><br \/>Even at this point, I probably could have forgiven the book except for one major drawback. The whole premise of the book is that Mia learns she is heir to the royal throne. This could have made for a worthy twist, except we rarely see Mia being trained to be a princess. Remove a few lines here and there that refer to her royal family or obligations and you wouldn't even know that Mia was training to become a princess. Minus its gimmick, this book is just another teen romance. As such, it disappointed me."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"was great until I needed it","text":"The book arrived on time as promised.

For me though, it was dead on arrival.  I could not connect with any of the characters as they seemed to live in this parallel universe where nobody behaved rationally (especially in the scene where the moms freaked out about &#34;the catch&#34;), most talked as if they were trying to come up with captions for a New Yorker comic, and any common sense was thrown to the wind.  I felt the premise was paper thin, and the two author gimmick (which does work in some cases) came off like a bad college writing class assignment.  Also, I'm no prude, but it seemed to romanticize a dangerous idea - meeting up with someone you don't know.  In this age of cyber predators, the premise just made me uncomfortable.  I also felt the story dragged as it was very repetitive, the big &#34;reveal&#34; was kind of a let down, and I hated the ending.

Some of the books are good, like the Velveteen Rabbit, that's a great book. However, it also uses other words that are not good for a younger student, a** & c***. As for the picture study part of the book, its awful! The pictures are hard to see in black and white.

She is subsequently arrested for the murder of her father's attorney and spends an evening in jail before she is released on bond.<br \/><br \/>The story unfolds in present day New Orleans and there is a hidden treasure that is at the root of the mystery that is presented here. The story goes between present day New Orleans and 16th century France to explain the reasons behind the treasure.<br \/><br \/>I thought there was too much going on in the story. Chloe Ledet, has cut all ties with her family and constantly complains about her childhood and family. There was too much complaining about her parents who did seem to be caught up in their own lives but were not exactly abusive towards her.  The mother is portrayed as somebody entirely stupid and Chloe makes sure that she puts her mother down at various times as well.<br \/><br \/>Also Chloe is summoned home because her father has been shot but NEVER during the story does she get to the hospital, she is too busy being pursued by murderers, attending a party, and tracking down the treasure that is at the heart of the story.<br \/><br \/>Also the story is published under a Christian publishing house and spends some time throwing a Christian message into the mix.  I have no problem with that and enjoy some Christian novels but this seemed forced to me.

The character that I did not like and was disgusted by the most was Nate's partner, Emily.  I found her to be immoral and very shallow.  All I could think about was the couple's baby, Trevor, and how he had a devious mother in Emily.  So for me the author did a good job.<br \/><br \/>The storyline is about Nate and Emily who have left New York because Nate's job, although a good job, can't take care of all the family's needs in Manhattan.  The couple have an apartment rent of $5000.00 per month and his salary is streched with the demands of living in New York.  I did not feel sympathy for the couple because they feel they have been exiled to Newport, Rhode Island; I wanted to jump into that book and tell them to be glad for what they did have.<br \/><br \/>Nate has found another job and has enough money to buy the family a house in Newport.  Emily and Nate, but especially Emily, are ashamed that they have to leave their life behind in New York.Most people would be happy that they have a new home and a new job to go to, particularly in the economic times that we have now in our economy.<br \/><br \/>This novel really makes you sit up and take notice of how people are not always happy and thankful for what they do have.  I felt sad for Nate because he did not have a good family life; his father never showed him any love and affection and he may have passed on something to Nate that will affect the young family for generations.

I did enjoy that Jennifer was not the prototypical SAHM - she definitely had an edge to her and at the same time was not over the top ridiculous in her disorganization as often the mothers are in these types of stories.

Corinna Leyendecker, the protagonist, loses her job and her boyfriend on the same day.  After some reflection, she realizes she didn't like her job all that much, and that she is unhappy with her excess weight and lack of friends.  After a short stint of job interviews, Corinna has a revelation that she would be happier as a small business owner, and gets to work getting a government grant to start a company that provides household services for busy, executive men.<br \/><br \/>As one might expect, Corinna is lucky enough to get a grant, a loan, and unemployment to start her small company. Somewhat unexpectedly, her primary helper is a punk lesbian from Corinna's former job and the first employee of the company is a friend of Corinna's grandmother.  A nasty, flu-like cold is almost a character in itself, as once Corinna catches the cold, her decision making abilities take a strong turn for the worse.  This leads Corinna into an awkward encounter with a dead man, which is the \"mystery\" part of the story.  However, Corinna is never actually frightened of the corpse, just frustrated and stressed, so the mystery is really more of a case of hijinks than a crime.<br \/><br \/>As in most stories of this type, Corinna overcomes challenges and obstacles to win success, lose and win back her friends, and decides that she doesn't really like her former boyfriend all that much, but is unexpectedly drawn to someone new.  Dust Angel is a light and charming story--a nice book for an afternoon of escapism.  There is a deft, light touch through most of the book which nicely smooths that this is a translation from German.  I hope that Dust Angel gets some exposure in the US, I believe it deserves a place on the 2013 list of \"beach reads.\""},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Awful","text":"This book makes absolutely no sense.

It also contains valuable ideas for any political lesbian who has wondered how she can possibly pay her bills and make the rent while remaining a full-time activist.<br \/><br \/>Who are the women who struggled to form lesbian communities--and how did they fund their activism?  In Everyday Mutinies: Funding Lesbian Activism, two dozen lesbians--including well-known activists such as Martina Navratilova, Alison Bechdel, Dee Mosbacher, and Jewelle Gomez--tell the stories of their activism, with an emphasis on how they support themselves and fund their political activities. Their examples can help you deal with raising and allocating money. Less than 0.3 of all philanthropic dollars are awarded to lesbian and gay projects each year. Yet Everyday Mutinies shares amazing success stories of women surviving, thriving, and making an impact by using the resources they have with intelligence and skill. You will be moved and inspired by the stories behind Naiad Press, The Ladder, Straight from the Heart, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.<br \/><br \/>Everyday Mutinies presents the voices of scientists, political strategists, artists, writers, fundraisers, and community organizers. These courageous women discuss their strategies for getting and using money to pursue their visions, including:<br \/><br \/>* funding scientific studies in creative ways<br \/><br \/>* liberating corporate resources<br \/><br \/>* encouraging responsible stewardship of inherited wealth<br \/><br \/>* getting paid for working on lesbian causes<br \/><br \/>* choosing a job to support activism<br \/><br \/>* financing lesbian media from magazines to documentaries<br \/><br \/>* giving time versus giving money"},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Not one of the best Reacher novels","text":"I was hoping for a blockbuster story and was a little disappointed in this one.

You have to draw family charts way into the past, with as much info as you can find out about your direct descendants.  I agree this might be helpful but just how probable is it for most people to accomplish?

How is it different?  For one thing Downtown Abbey gives more dimension to the below stairs characters.  [[ASIN:0425262588 Rutherford Park: A Novel]] does not.  The below stairs characters are not fleshed out enough and the characters for me felt very one-dimensional.  I think that is what makes Downtown Abbey so addictive.  The characters both below stairs and above have depth and passion which keeps one coming back again and again.<br \/><br \/>This book started very slowly too.  I almost gave up about a third of the way through but about three quarters of the way through,the story did become more interesting.  The story takes place in Yorkshire where William and Octavia Cavendish live at Rutherford Hall.  The opening chapters deal with a maid in the household who has become pregnant. She is found near a river that runs by the estate trying to kill herself and the servants run to save her. What transpires is an ongoing thread throughout the story.<br \/><br \/>Octavia Cavendish is still a young woman since her husband is considerably older than she is.  William Cavendish married her for her money even though her family is in trade.  He needed her fortune to renovate the estate.  He maintains the strictures that the aristocracy live by.  Those strictures are suffocating Octavia.  She has become a shell of the woman she was when she first married William.<br \/><br \/>William and Octavia have a crisis in their marriage and Octavia decides to step out of her cage.  She begins to turn things on their head by the end of the novel.  I felt that the ending was very unsatisfying.

However, my mother, 80, who can no longer read long books, greatly enjoyed the emotive aspects of the story.<br \/><br \/>As a retired education administrator whose job it was to order curriculum for our county-wide district, I have read hundreds of children's books. \"The World's Greatest Elephant\" is a children's book with a good vocabulary, and has a theme of overcoming difficulties in life. It is the type of story that could spawn meaningful discussions.<br \/><br \/>However, the artwork is very dreary (mostly muted reds and grays - probably a cost factor in production of the book). For instance, the picture of Modoc being rescued from the ocean simply shows an elephant in straps against a stark white background. There are never any blue skies. People's faces tend toward the \"impressionistic\" end of a continuum rather than a realistic, more photographic quality. Bram, shown atop Modoc's back in a circus picture, has the face of an old man and no neck. The artist's strong point was certainly not in drawing people.<br \/><br \/>It is unfortunate the Ralph Helfer couldn't have found a better artist, because the story, with good art and color, could easily have been rated a \"5.\""},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Slow-Moving, Reasonably Complicated Mystery","text":"In the newest Inspector Rutledge mystery, the police detective is summoned to the home of the Tellers. The family's youngest brother, a missionary recovering from illness and not eager to go back into the field, who was in a hospital suffering from a mysterious paralysis, has vanished. Not only are there no leads, but the family itself, comprised of brothers (included one wounded in the Great War), sisters, sisters-in-law, and an often-addled grandmother, all seem to be hiding the clues that might tell Rutledge where Walter Teller is. Then, out of nowhere, he reappears, just as Rutledge is handed another mystery: a woman, the wife of a Peter Teller, has been murdered in her home in a country village. Is this Peter Teller related to the formerly missing man, Walter Teller? And why was she murdered?<br \/><br \/>In a subplot, Rutledge is assaulted by a knife-wielding young man on a bridge, but the assailant escapes, attacking other men who resemble Rutledge. It is obvious the tough wants to finish the job on Rutledge. Can Ian capture his assailant before he strikes again?<br \/><br \/>As in A Test of Wills, the specter of the Great War is keenly felt. Rutledge's search for the truth was absorbing, but I had a hard time caring about the Teller family at all (even the one person they were protecting), not to mention the neighbors of the murdered woman. Even she turned out to not be very sympathetic. The mystery was fairly complex, even though certain well-placed clues revealed who the husband of the murdered woman was long before the ending. I'm afraid that at the end, it turned out I didn't really care much who killed who and why.

I'll just do a little thing here and there.<br \/>This book follows a Korean family starting from the early 1900's on. When Sunja finds herself pregnant by a man who is less than available a nice man, a tubercular minister, says that he will marry her and take her to Japan with him. From there the story really just takes off and you get to see so many struggles from inside the family to things as big as prejudices and exile.<br \/>So much happens in the novel I can't even begin to touch on everything without making this review a mini novel. It's such an expansive and immersive story that you can't help but get hooked and invested in the lives of these characters. This story will make tear you up at times and make you laugh at other. One thing it definitely will do is make you thankful for the things you do have.<br \/>I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in it from what they have heard about it in general and those that are into generational family sagas.

I do love the laundry list of New York City architecture and many of the photos highlight some very interesting architectural styles. It's a shame this is a physically small book rather than a true coffee table book because there are several pictures that would have been better served by being larger so we could really see the details. My primary reason for the one star deduction is for the repetition of many of the same photos - they are repeated several pages later in a different size.

For that reason alone, I'm glad that I read this, but I didn't like anything about the book.<br \/><br \/>Nothing about this story gripped me, and its \"modernization\" is lazy beyond description. The author changed side characters' races and sexual orientations, and she dropped a few superfluous references to Taylor Swift, but that was pretty much it. Even though Nancy had a cell phone, she didn't bother to use it, and she acted selfishly throughout the entire book, letting her friends run all over town and fear for her life because she couldn't bother to keep her phone with her or answer it when it rang.

Examples:<br \/><br \/>1.) Really good dystopian fiction almost doubles as survival manuals. See &#34;Life as We Knew It&#34; for an example. In this post apocalypse world, once A WEEK a 16 year-old girl walks two miles with an M-16 to bring back all the water she can carry. A loaded M-16 weighs about 9 pounds. A gallon of water weighs about 8 pounds. The average person uses a gallon of water a day. It seems unlikely that she could have carried enough water to last a week (56 pounds + 9 for the gun) for two miles with a loaded M-16.<br \/><br \/>2.) The survival items she packs for a long trek somewhere else, in a world where there's no other people anywhere, include Tide and deodorant. Seriously.

The author describes Cassie's greatest worry prior to this event being whether or not anyone thought she was pretty. That's how you know this is written by a male author.

Unfortunately the character of Eamonn is over-the-top. He's a walking disaster who careens from one faux pas to another, but in spite of its flaws I enjoyed the book for its refreshing, optimistic tone.

I'm keeping it as I am an old dragon and it's different than the other coloring books I have."},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"Book is great for our small group.","text":"The book is in pretty good shape, but it is not in fact new as the title said. It had a personalized note in the front where it was given as a small group gift to a couple, and also had writing on some of the pages.<br \/><br \/>With that said, the content is pretty good and we love the discussions that spurn from it in our small group."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Supplement curriculum","text":"Supplement curriculum"},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Three Stars","text":"Very complex."},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"Three Stars","text":"Good book"},{"label":-1,"rating":2.0,"title":"below average book on travel photography","text":"There are tons of tutorial books on travel photography out there. You're probably asking should you buy this one instead of one of the others? Based on my experience, I would say no. The biggest problem is that the example photos are not very inspirational. Few of the photos are of recognizable landmarks, so you cannot easily compare his ideas with photos you have taken in the past. Most of the photos could be taken anywhere, which is not my idea of \"travel\" photography. I prefer travel photos that highlight unique locations. Further, the printing quality is kind of dull (compared to real printed photos), which is not very encouraging. The text of the book does have some useful information on travel photography, but without inspirational photos to back up his ideas, I lost interest quickly."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"How many lies does the Government keep","text":"Diane Chamberlain is one of my go to authors, and when I see she has new book, I rush to purchase.  This one had me so bored in the beginning I was ready to move on. The characters are very vivid and real, she is a masterful writer painting excellent visuals of the characters and their living conditions.  The main character Ivy is a very loveable young girl and you want her to survive and prosper.  As bad as the program was I am sure there were good social workers out there who really thought they were helping these impoverish communities.  While I think it is barbaric that this sterilization went on and the rest of the country had no idea, it does make me wonder &#34;What other secrets are out there that our Government is keeping from us&#34;.  Many things were to easy to figure out from the , Jane's marriage from the first pages seemed to be doomed.  Read this if you are interested in this sterilization project, if not read some of her other work, because this one is not her best novel."},{"label":-1,"rating":2.0,"title":"each page the same","text":"each page is exactly the same and not very creative, maybe good for younger than age 8 kids"},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"It's \"The Department of Energy\", Rick!","text":"Bought as a gift a looooong time ago. &#60;shrug&#62; The recipient enjoyed it."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"An Ok Syfy Movie","text":"Not a bad movie i mean book. The writing was ok and the characters were ok.<br \/>Took too long to get to the moon. I was skimming over parts. A syfy movie directed by Michael Bay. Fun but should have been funner. Funner?<br \/><br \/>Would have worked better if two stories were told at once the present earth and the future earth.<br \/>The Taiwan sub plot and the saboteurs were not necessary.<br \/><br \/>I thought a 'Time Paradox' would create a shockwave uplifting mountains and generate giant tsunamis? Time is circular? Nevermind."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"I was underwhelmed.","text":"This book has several faults.  First, it purports to be a reference for novel writers, but it is filled with suggestions and references for screenwriters, which aren't apropos.  Second, the author constantly uses her own special terms, screenwriters' jargon, etc. without bothering to explain what the terms mean.  Sometimes, she gets around to explaining the term many, many pages later, but by then I the reader is thoroughly frustrated.  Third, I was astounded at the poor quality of the writing.  One would hope that a book on writing would be an exemplar of proper writing.  Fourth, it struck me as a glib, shallow exposition on the subject.  I wish I had bought something (anything) else."},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"Eats It","text":"Bad writing. No insight. Sounds like a wimp, even though he's a marine. Couldn't finish it. Don't bother."},{"label":0,"rating":3.0,"title":"Just ok. Disappointing ending.","text":"The book was ok\u2026 if you already know a-lot of info about the cartel. Didn't find much surprising. But if you don't know much, its a good book."},{"label":-1,"rating":2.0,"title":"It's mostly snacks","text":"I bought several cookbooks for my 7 year old picky eater, hoping it would make him more willing to eat meals he helped cook. I was really disappointed in this one. It contains \"recipes\" like putting sliced cheese and sliced ham on a sliced Pilsbury biscuit. Even a kid doesn't need a cookbook for that. The most disappointing thing was the lack of meals. There's a lot of ham and cheese: on bisuits, on buns, on bread.  The rest of the book is mostly snacks. Snacks are not that useful for me."},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"long read","text":"interesting, gave me a look at much of the history that I was very uneducated about.<br \/>felt the characters were mostly solidarity in their characters and doubted their possible relationships, but it kept me reading to the end."}]
