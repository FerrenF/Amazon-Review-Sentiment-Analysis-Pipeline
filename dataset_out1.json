stones had grown up in middle class families and mick jagger had even attended the london school of economics for a years so they were a tiny bit less unprepared for sudden wealth allen klein a new york accountant who had made a career representing american singers such as sam cooke and bobby vinton, was extremely ambitious and convinced the stones that he'd get them more money lots of it he followed through so the beatles were interested paul mccartney was wary thought and with good reason klein was an operator and while he did get more money for his clients he made sure he did all right too somehow he had ended up with the rights to all of sam cooke's songs and made questionable tax shelters for his clients.author fred goodman goes into great detail about the angles klein was playing

anishinaabe culture traditions and community ground her daily life how she balances and code switches between her white and wish families and how she's torn between heading to college but knowing she has a responsibility to her family and community as a biracial person its incredibly relatable.a fast-paced thriller and a thoughtful coming of age story firekeeper's daughter is a love letter to anishinaabe traditions and the power of community but in it boulley also lays bare the long-term impacts of colonization racism and bigotry politics within indigenous communities the way the federal

this book i enjoyed the first book in the megalodon team series and hoped this one would be as good if not better unfortunately that was not the case for me i found alexis to be frustrating childish and annoying the one bright spot in the book was scott he was so loving passionate protective and all around great with all of those wonderful attributes alexis just refused to believe that scott loved her wanted to be with her and was only interested in her it was okay for her to hear bits and pieces of conversations and jump to conclusions but the one moment he did it was a catastrophic event with her storming away and leaving him to berate himself.so often throughout this book i hoped scott would just stop pursuing alexis and find a woman who wasn't so fickle and flighty one who could actually return his feelings without a bunch of games and back and forth struggle i understood that their jobs within the navy and their rankings were an issue but alexis took it to the extreme i wanted to scream when she would continue to address scott as 'commander' even though he practically begged her to call him by his first name i took that as a way for her to not only put up a wall but also as an unnecessary show of power over him to let him know that she wasn't going to succumb to his affections.i will try to read the next book in the series hopefully it will be better but i

her life even when she has her own little boy to mother shockingly the tragedy happened when she was only seven and her little brother almost five a seven year old shouldn't even be left alone to care for themselves let alone for another who is to blame the child who took mothers pills the slightly older sister watching him or the parents the father who was working and left them in the care of the unstable mother who left her children alone to go out with another man little mark was the clear favorite child of them both and with him gone susan suffers even more than she had before when she's grown and has a child of her own she fears she'll hurt him and is too anxious to mother him in most any way if she can't face her demons she'll lose everything.i love books that just seem to flow you

only way to describe relic's hell's legend is with a phrase a bloody violent fantastic journey through carnage terror and a downright epic tale that makes underworld and every zombie movie look bad that sounds about right.kell's legend is the first is relic's clockwork vampire chronicles it follows kelly a legendary warrior who has grown old and a number of other characters from his granddaughter vienna to anukis, a clockwork vampire-turned-exile in her own homeland when strange twisted albino soldiers descend upon the city of jalder, tell must take up his axe once again to defend his family but with that action comes a flood of memories hinting at his dark past at the tell nobody remembers or everyone chooses to forget...remic certainly managed a tour de force with hell's legend i've never read anything quite so unapologetic about its violence but also brilliant in its brute force hell's legend is rough for sure at the same time however it's entertaining and powerful taking all that is wonderful about truly epic adventurous fantasy and twisting it like quentin tarantino twists the movies relic is the tarantino of fantasy and science fiction i presume and if that isn't a compliments then i don't know what is.kell's legend isn't just about action and brilliantly detailed fights it's packed full of amazing dialogue and some clever witty banter to boots and the characters are three-dimensional, something i think many fantasy writers of the more action-packed vein including myself have issue with relic has managed to put together a tale that pushes the boundaries while maintaining the necessary elements of a good fantasy novel interesting characters gripping conflicts etc..there were only two problems i had with hell's legend sometimes the action can be a bit much for the most part it's entertaining and propels the plot but sometimes it feels overbearing there aren't a lot of breaks.2 the language is outside of my comfort zone in one scene and only one as far as i can recall if his language had kept in that vein for more than one chapter then i would have tossed the book at the wall but thankfully that is not what happened however if you cannot stand foul language in any form this is not the book for you.both of these problems are personal preferences and not indicative of any significant fault of the novel or remic. if you aren't bothered by these things then this is definitely a book for you if you're already a relic fan then you'll love hell's legend.i look forward to the second book in the series i'd love to know what happens with the clockwork vampires kelly his granddaughter and some of the other characters","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"awesome book to start my journey","text":"awesome book

of the story however is not toad the first half of the book reads like an autobiography focusing mainly on the narrator's ambivalence about his own career only in the second half of the book does an actual plot develop involving chicanery within the political and professional world of psychiatry structured more like a mystery yarn the intrigue of the second half succeeded at drawing me in to the conclusion.unfortunately the book missed some interesting possibilities in exploring the \"wisdom\" of toad and the narrator's relation to it despite being seen as the project's inspiration the narrator remains aloof from it surprised that anyone is taking it seriously we're told that toad enjoys legions of users who genuinely benefit from the program it might have been fun if the narrator learned something from it or an equally interesting possibility learned to disagree with its teachings and became a heretic to his own following.still in all a good read told with inventiveness and

friend luke foster lives just right down the street this coming of age novel talks about all the things a girl wants to happen once she enters high school ricky jo wants to be popular and fit in with the cool crowd but can she still be herself and not change to fit in with the popular crowd?i just loved this book so much i could relate so much to ricky jo at parts in the book my dad was also a tabasco farmers but quite once there was a big buy out which is just what ricky jo's dad did also i live on a farm with cattle crops and barns so i just got really into the story ricky jo lived in a town that isn't too different from mine the author uses a lot of references that i could understand.i also really enjoyed the characters ricky jo is friends with a bunch of mean girls but at the end you really see redeeming qualities in them all my favorite character was luke and he really held the book together at times while there relationship was perdictable, i just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen with them in the end i am glad that ricky jo's friend mackenzie turned out to be a true friend i really liked her at the beginning and thought that she was nice to ricky jo when the other girls weren't.ricki jo is relatable to me because there have been a lot of times that i have been in the same position as her i never really fit in at my high school and i remember putting up with mean comments just to say that i have friends but i never had as good as friend as luke ricky jo is lucky i also loved all her funny commentary there were parts when i was laughing out loud.i also just got to say i love kentucky it is so beautiful and i love how the author you a lot of descriptive language to describe their farm and how farm life was.overall, the queen of kentucky has a very good message that i think everybody should take the time to ready i would recommend this to any girl that is in middle school i really enjoyed it and glad that i had it down in my debut author

start??? i just recently had the pleasure of meeting virginia mckevitt at a book signing function in new orleans i hadn't heard of her as an author and was not familiar with her work i read all types but heavy into the paranormal erotic ski i and contemporary romance none of which really are ya or na i picked up both the books at the signing and promised virginia i would read them well since i hadn't brought my kindle with me i decided to start the first book i was a little tired and didn't get far along i didn't have the chance to pick it back up until i got back from new orleans.when i started reading ill be honest i want sure if this was something for me i realize the first few chapters most authors set up the characters so it might be a tad slow once we got past the formalities of the characters bow the set up was actually very interesting good back ground info for later in the ready the read took off om i so want expecting that.kristina based on all accounts is one feisty strong willed strong headed no nonsense young lady when her parents were murdered she didn't crumble and fall apart now don't get me wrong yes she was devastated but she was out to seek revenge she wanted to see whoever did this dead kristina was what we might call a half breed that all i saying on this subject in comes tegrin guardianassassin and the kings right hand man tegrin was sent on a mission by his king to dispose of the cotton a clan of women who feed off others emotions who had found the opening between the two worlds they wanted out from under the king to do as they pleased on top of the pleasure they experienced from feeding on the memories of the humans they were experiencing other emotions and it became an addiction in the small town of blessings the bodies were piling up and tegrin was sent to stop them its in kristin's home tegrin meets his destiny kristina grant it he doesn't know that yet tegrin was to get in and out and not let any humans see him that didn't work out so well he ends up allying with kristin's two friends sissy and jimmy and of course sissy dog to a retired via operative in order to stop the couton. so much for humans not finding out.there was a lot unknown about kristina and we do find out what she is the story played out perfectly from the tattoo appearing after her first kill to her warrior like instincts what happens when she finds her real dads military foot locker left to her when he died to her going to potwain with tegrin to meet her grandfather and be trained as a guardian and taught how to use her powers shes the best of both worlds.there is a little touch of humor for example when tegrin brings armor a guardian to train and fight with kristina because he cant be around her and she breaks his nose my favorite was when kristina smacked maketis nose tegrins stallion now you have to understand everyone feared tegrin but they feared his horse also she had those two spinning she showed absolutely no fear as in all good reads there is a sad part but you'll need to read for yourself i don't want to give too many spoilers hmmmm but i going to give one now tegrin and kristina do the deed yes the stone cold hearted assassin who has no emotions fell for our girl everyone saw it the king her grandfather everyone i loved it now i cant wait to jump into the hunted kudos virginia i really did love

what happens when enthusiastic followers of jesus her grandparents were influenced by the jesus movement slowly shift from the faith that drew them in and get wrapped up in rules and behavioral codes and the strict dictates of one charismatic unaccountable leader.the storytelling here is so good the author masterfully shares the scenes of her childhood without bitterness towards god faith or her

feel like i want to sit down with the author pour a glass of wine and talk about the amazing ways god works in our lives she really succeeds in making readers feel like friends.the story is divided into three sections her childhood her experience breaking out and trying to navigate mainstream culture and then her process of figuring out a new way to engage with god outside of her strict abusive upbringing i loved it all her descriptions of her childhood are so vivid i felt like i was right there which was difficult at times there are some tough moments her take on first encountering oprah winfrey show and how quickly television commercials stirred up a dissatisfaction with her life shed never felt before is a great reminder of how much were being manipulated by what we watch and there

should now pay for their education too if someone wants to go to college pay for it -- student loans are available -- or don't got it's that easy unfortunately our esteemed president has made it

charles re coughlin broadcast a popular national radio program blending religion economics and politics lacing it with ever-increasing amounts of anti-semitism. with mainstream strands of anti-semitism, popularity of the kkt and worsening economic conditions in the great depression german-american ultranationalism provided a voice for thousands in american this was another side to the melting pot theory by demonstrating how two different traditions converged in the united states with immigrant families offering new ideas to their local communities these ideas also united other groups such as german fascists in long island holding rallies with italian fascists under the american flag indeed the united states didn't escape public displays supporting fascism and the terrain served as grounds for different groups to \"melt\" their ideology together.the german-american bund boasted in the late so that it had , members in states-patriotic americans all dedicated to the democratic principles of the united states many of its leaders and members were sincere not only in their personal convictions but also in the best interests of their country-the united states yes there were some who had negative attitudes towards jews and other minorities but then so did the majority of americans at that time the author has unearthed that some bund chapters had working relationships with hispanic and other minority groups and even had some jews as members yes they flew the swastika because it was central to their racial identity.discovering how the local bund blended fascism and democracy has been made difficult by local hesitations to revisit a negative chapter of the past this is further compounded when people seek to hide history one notable example was in when suffolk county new york legislators passed a resolution sponsored by herb david r-yaphank, for the removal of pro-nazi references on the subdivision records from original documents this proposed rewriting of history on the original records failed since it wasn't approved by the state government despite these obstacles this new book they too were americans the german-american bund in words photos and artifacts sheds a whole new light on an often neglected part of local and national history in order to paint a more accurate view of history prior to the u.s. entry into world war ii.author scott freehand skillfully uses primary documents to sketch a history of the bundists as they might have viewed themselves as well as to be more understanding of the german-american bund members place and time in the history of this country his book published by the well-known and respected re james bender is a very detailed and well-written account with excellent photographs

road to rangoon that is set across the beautiful yet sad land of burma which is centered around three characters whose lives are entwined and engulfed in the clutches of the civil war against the burmese military armed forces officially known as tatmadaw.synopsisin s burma the british ambassadors son goes missing.discovering himself in the north of the country michael atwood is in imminent danger trapped between sides fighting a bitter civil war and with no way back to rangoon his best hope of salvation is to trust thuza, a ruby smuggler who offers to help him escape.beautiful and

ticket out of poverty for than an ambitious military officer exploiting those caught in the war offers an opportunity for promotion and distinction.but as all three learn to their cost in this enigmatic and savage country everyone has a price.from the heart of burma exotic rubyland comes an emotional thriller as three lives are thrown together by the desperate choices they make to survive in a country gripped by civil war a tale of ambition salvation and hope that confirms lucy cruickshanks as a master storyteller.michael atwood the son of a british ambassador in burma goes missing and soon he realizes that he is caught in the war from both the sides and the power they holds on his capture is invaluable that is when he needs to trust the only person who can help him to rescue from the grips of the rebels.thuza, the local burmese girl is a ruby smuggler who knows her job well like the back of her hands on how to differentiate ruby from the rocks as it is the only salvation to buy her parents freedom from the right officials.than, works and abides by the strict rules of the tatmadaw army is soon tested on his loyalty towards the army and he is forever desperate to climb the ladders of success by pleasing the general things change when he forces his son mind to join the forces and to take strict measures against those who wrong by the armed forces.these three lives in burma now known as myanmar will break the hearts of the readers as their lives unfold and when their fate plays a major role to bring them together under dire circumstances.the author has once again delivered a spectacular tale of love freedom and loyalty towards one own government set against the back of another country from the far east burma which harbors a difficult era in burmese history which not only torn apart the lives of the common man but which made it impossible to survive under the dominance of the tatmadaw army.the author has evocatively captured the time frame as well as the location with her eloquent words the background of burma is dominated by lush and dense green forests and the tombs of the many buddhist temples and that the author has vividly captured in her story line the land where beauty of mother nature and repressive army plays a major role is well painted into the canvas of the story as the author strikingly captures the culture the local dialect and the grief of the citizens through her story the author has done her research quite well with the ways how to find a ruby among the rocks where to find it and also the governance of the army and their torture among common people.the author's writing style is spellbinding that i lost track of time as i devoured the novel in just one sitting the book is highly addictive as articulate narrative shifts from one character to another the pacing is really fast despite the fact that the author has written the scenes descriptively that made it easier for me to picture the events right in front of my eyes the story is engrossing and kept me glued till the very end the author has penned with so much deep moving emotions and it definitely felt like she has poured all her best emotions into it.the characters are drawn with realism and simplicity the challenges thrown on their track made me rooting for them all the three characters are inspiring and sad laced with grief and their demeanor is something to watch out for when they are caught in the politics and the war with the government and they are bound to leave an impression long after the end of this powerful historical fiction the story has a complex and nostalgic ending that definitely moved me the supporting characters are highly well-developed.overall the story is enthralling thought-provoking and thoroughly gripping till

southern society to have a double standard of justice the novel also presents a somewhat optimistic view of white southerners that was somewhat unusual at the time the novel appeared the story indicates there are good human beings like attics finch everywhere even in the midst of a corrupt society even those who do wrong the novel goes on to suggest often act out of ignorance and weakness rather than a deliberate impulse to hurt others.another theme of the novel is the transition from innocence to experience at the beginning of the story scout's world is limited to the boundaries of her immediate neighborhood she feels safe and secure and totally confident that the way things are done in her home is not just the right way but the only way the arrival of dill who comes from a broken home and has lived in another state gives scout her first hint of a variety of experiences beyond her narrow horizons then on her first day of school she begins to discover that not everyone agrees that the way things are done in maycomb, alabama is necessarily correct she also learns that sometimes it is necessary to compromise in order to get along even though scout's teacher's ideas about how to teach reading may be wrong scout must respect the teacher's authority her own father advises her to ignore the teacher's ban on reading at home but to pretend to go along with the teacher's methods while in the classroom this kind of social hypocrisy is new to scout and she is surprised to hear her very moral father advocating it.related to the theme of innocence and experience is the novel's suggestion that innocent children can often see large moral issues more clearly than adults scout jem, and dill never waver in their horror at the injustice done to tom robinson the adults in the story however see all the complexities of the situation to the point of being blinded to the central issue of right and wrong however much scout may grow through her exposure to new experiences one hopes that she will never lose her childlike undertaking of justice in the view of this novel's author justice is a simple concept to recognize the difference between justice and injustice does not take any special degree of wisdom or sophistication in fact the learned members of the community--such as the judge and prosecutor--and the proudly religious baptists who are

innkeeper with adventurous ambition hugh leaves his family and home to pursue riches in the crusades the crusade story line does not dominate and should not scare away the casual readers the setting merely sets the stage for hugh's acquisition of a relic that's value is unknown to even him upon hugh's return home he finds his village in shambles and his family presumably dead.this sets in motion the key storyline of the jester as hugh goes in search of those responsible for ruining his life a david vs goliath revenge story unfolds with hugh resorting to any means necessary to get close to those responsible for his pain even resorting to taking up the role of a jester here is able to gain the trust of those responsible and devise a plot worthy of the pain he has endured along the way hugh gains allies and uncovers truths beyond his imagination patterson's imagery and detail pull you into the story as you root for hugh in his own personal crusade.patterson and co-collaberator andrew gross tie everything together in a climatic final battle discovery and of course a patterson plot twist the plot twist can be seen coming and came as little surprise to me while fault could be found in this fact i still found the jester well worth the time patterson's trademark rapid pace keeps the pages turning and suspense mounting","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"fun and

book has also been published under the title the penguin book of latin american short stories it came out in and contained works by as many latin american authors from seven nations and puerto rico brazil with selections and argentina with 5, were by far the most frequently represented countries the emphasis on brazil perhaps reflecting one of the compiler's specializations portuguese literature with the exceptions of pieces by the writers machado de assist and quiroga, who were described as the pair marking the start of modern latin american literature the book's selections covered the period from the s to , with special focus on the s and s.the collection featured old and new voices the celebrated and the lesser known and highlighted writers who created unexpected dreamlike worlds some of the works could be regarded as classics machado de assists the psychiatrist,\" quiroga's the dead man,\" borges the circular ruins,\" cort\u00e0zar's \"axolotl,\" carpenter's journey back to the source,\" guimar\u00e3es rosa's the third bank of the river and fuentes the doll queen.\"other writers were well known - onetti, rulfo, garcia marquez -- but their selections differed from the usual ones in other anthologies there were other celebrated writers - amado boy casares, lispector, scliar, allende puig, arenas cabrera infante ferr\u00e9. and then writers who were comparatively lesser known and from brazil armon\u00eda somers, murillo rubi\u00e3o, joan ubaldo ribeiro, lydia fagundes telles, rube fonseca, paul emilio sales comes or puerto rico ana lydia vegan writers who might be considered comparable in their creation of dreamlike worlds but who didn't make it into this anthology asturias levinson, pinera, arreola, monterroso, donoso and peri rossi.some of the stories were written in a minutely described hallucinatory style candor seemed merely to pile incident upon incident borges carpentier, boy cesares, somers, puig, arenas garcia marquez rulfo, cabrera infante the one by cabrera infante differed from the rest in that it was a humorous parody filled with lighthearted wordplay by the narrator but many of these stories were nearly unreadable and couldn't be penetrated in any depth exceptions for me were works that described the killing of a pig and a participant's revulsion in grotesque and memorable detail ribeiro, the shift in consciousness of a narrator who entered a museum cort\u00e0zar, and a narrator who sought a character from his childhood fuentes these succeeded in drawing me in to their bizarre worlds.others were told clearly but in a style similar to folk tales or fables and involved extraordinary larger than life events candor fantastic characters such as a psychiatrist who decided to help humanity by building a madhouse in town machado de assist a father who went to live in a boat on the river and never returned guimar\u00e3es rosa a lover who escaped from an angry husband amado a man who found and \"tamed\" a woman allende a magician who could pull tigers out of his sleeves but was worn down by reality rubi\u00e3o, and the plagues of egypt as described by the egyptians scliar.others were also told in a more or less straightforward and realistic way but created a strong atmosphere of unreality or tension as in the description of the death of a man quiroga, the events surrounding a murder onetti, the description of a plot by two characters against a third sales gomes, a female narrator's budding independence from her controlling grandmother fagundes telles, a narrator's description of the menace involved in several relationships including her own vegan and the friendship of two girls at school that crossed racial and class boundaries ferr\u00e9. fagundes telles' writing was described by the writer as closer to the psychological precision of french writers from the s and s than to the naturalism and regionalism or magic realism of her contemporaries which won her comparisons with colette.aside from the classic stories i appreciated this collection most for the many examples of writing from brazil for a number of the more straightforward well-constructed stories and one or two of the folk tale-like stories","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"a must-have on your trip to the big island","text":"a must-have on your trip to the big island. after reviewing most of

with marsem in an unexpected way and the family bond and loyalty she shares with her brother she can be related to by many as she is considered an outcast in her family despite the small frustrations that i encountered this story was fast-paced, full of action during fighting scenarios offers a love story and if one notices a bit of spiritual enlightenment i did find myself unable to put the book down as i was anxious to see what would happen next this tale sets up perfectly for the next book to come in a way as i for one was left in suspense in my desire to know more of the main characters trials to encounter.the downside of p\u00f9qest book 1 the hunter for me was not that the author created a new world of unending possibilities it was the created words or language was used often and a small few were left undefined a pronunciation key to know how to interpret the words would have helped me personally to understand how to interpret the words a handful of sentences had me wondering what was occurring or being expressed i feel that ms care may risk others whom could also become confused or put the tale down and move on until i decided just to flow with it and read the language without special attention other than looking in the glossary when necessary then i was able to get an understanding of what was being told and enjoyed it as this story is taking place in another world

twentieth century without looking at the vast transformation of businesses and the marketplace which have taken place in this period.the odd pages contain photographs and articles from the new york times which sweep through major episodes of twentieth century business including trust busting the great depression the electronics revolution and mega-mergers at the close of the century the articles are accompanied by commentary from the married couple who are the authors both of whom have been business writers for the new york times.whether you are a student doing research for a high school paper or a policy maker who wants a quick reminder of the events and forces which have shaped business in this century you will find this book highly readable and informative in the introductory words of former federal reserve chairman paul volcker rereading history may never substitute fully for personal experience in shaping our behavior but there is something to the admonition of one of the th

being autistic adds anything to the story except validating confusing dialog where i have to step back and map out who is saying what because the total absence of pronouns while perhaps characteristic of autism works against the reader in a literary form if the story was just about marcelo living his everyday life it would be a refreshing change of pace but putting him into this story creates a convoluted mash-up of under developed plot lines the story leads you in one direction only to completely abandon that path and pick up another in the opposite direction not like plot twists but more like following a fly across the room watching it randomly buzz about without any real direction stork sets the story up in one direction and then switches it to irrelevant tangential plot lines it is

cook book i own. about four or five years ago i took a couple of hour class from the author suvir saran at sur la table in portland oregon since then i've made recipes out of indian home cooking - which may not seem like a lot but when you consider that i eat out more than of the time and i don't think i've made more than recipes from any other cook book i have ever owned - not to mention that there are a few of the recipes that i like so much that i tend to make them repeatedly grape raita, stir fried green beans with coconut stir-fried carrots with cumin and lime coconut chicken with cashews ground turkey with spinach and whole spices and bangalore fried shrimp recipes actually is pretty good tonight i made three that i hadn't tried before the red kidney beans with ginger tomato and curry leaves green chutney and onion pachadi. as usual they were all wonderful - although i probably didn't pick the best complements since all three have lots of onions in them i'm hoping to try another recipes in this book by the end of the years making things from this cookbook is one of my favorite simple pleasures in life particularly when we have friends over to share the deliciousness.before suvir saran introduced me to indian cooking i was intimidated by it while i loved going out for indian food there were such varied and unrecognizable flavors to me that i couldn't even imagine how the dishes were made yet once i started making saran's easy-to-follow recipes i found that it really isn't difficult at all in fact i now understand the basic cooking techniques and spices well enough that i can look in my refrigerator to see what ingredients i have and then improve something using indian spices and cooking techniques and end up with something that tastes great.i'm not a vegetarian and have always felt sorry for my vegetarian friends because of how much they were missing out on the flavors and variety of an omnivore diet in fact often when i ate vegetarian meals in the past i felt unsatisfied yet if i were to cook out of indian home cooking every day i could easily be a vegetarian and not feel like i was missing out on anything the flavors are varied and interesting enough that i don't feel the need to necessarily include meat dishes in meals when i do cook an indian meal frequently the meat dishes are a small part of the meal rather than the focal point i guess what i'm saying is that when i cook out of indian home cooking i tend to eat more vegetables and less meat - which is a far healthier diet if i could only keep one cook

acknowledges that she's not proud of her behavior and you get the sense her nemesis josh never has been proud of it either he says as much actually people aren't perfect we find out that lucy's childishness is due to just being plain lonely and homesick and wanting attention from the only person she interacts with day in and day out she's smart and quirky and witty with lots of attitude i loved seeing the layers of josh peeling away as well throughout the book and learning why he acts the way he does the way they banter and flirt is amazing and seeing their relationship develop was so

lost or left out of some big plot due to the excellent story telling this is crime writing suspense at its very best.vanish pulls you in from the very first page starting with milk's heartbreaking story of human trafficking she and a group of russian girls are crossing into america from mexico having been lured there by the promise of a better life however by the end of the chapter one of the girls is dead and milk has been sold into a prostitution ring milk's story which we keep flashing back to is gritty and often hard to read probably because it is very real.we then switch to coroner maura isles who is going about her daily routine in vivid medical detail when she discovers that one of the bodies in the morgue is still alive jane does is rushed to the emergency room where we meet up with our other protagonist detective jane rizzoli who has just gone into labor following a take down at the courthouse she rocksthrough a fantastic series of events that kept me on the edge of my seat and never able to guess what was coming next the formerly \"dead\" woman grabs a security guards gun and takes 6 people hostage in the hospital one of which is detective rizzoli. jane does won't talk to the police negotiator and we only learn her motives after a man disguised as member of the swat team joins her his story is equally enthralling.this tense drama plays out for a large part of the book bringing in a host of other characters and their pop's along with clever plot twists and exciting action all of which gerritsen manages to tie together we meet jake's husband bi agent gabriel dean i'm assuming we met him in earlier books we also have jake's partner hints of a love triangle reporters spies and bad guys in washington we get crime scene investigations and the makings of a

read this book right before the movie came out i admit that this book had been sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust i also admit to enjoying the twilight books so i was not opposed to ms meyer's writing or style but i'm not a huge sci-fi person and the premise of this book just did not appeal to me despite having friends tell me how much they liked it so i procrastinated...and procrastinated...and procrastinated it took the movie and a stephanie meyer event i attended to kick me in the butt and move it up my reading pile and once i read it what do i have to say now?i loved it this was one of those books where i just shook my heads and thought to myself what took me so long?\" this was a beautifully written book exposing the many layers of love and humanity the size of the book is intimidating and it starts a bit slowly but i found reading it worth the time and for me the reading process quickly sped up as i became more and more engaged and invested with the characters and plot i found the plot unique and engaging the character development well fleshed-out, the multi-layers of love development thoughtful and the analysis of real humanity beautifully examined.i also admit to not being a fan of love triangles they tend to be exhausting unrealistic selfish and overly dramatic but what i loved about this story is that it really wasn't a love triangle not in the simplistic sense of the terms i don't want to spoil the plot but i found the whole thought process and relationship between melanie and wanderer fascinating i really found their relationship the most engaging then with a love interest or two thrown in there and the confusion over two minds sharing one body the plot really thickened but again with an imaginative process and the love discussed wasn't limited to just romantic love - there's also friendship family forgiveness camaraderie community sacrifice and many levels of love in between these this is one of the things and subjects i was most impressed with in this novel.bottomline i loved this book and added it as one of my favorites i have also listened to the audiobook because i needed to readhear the book twice in a row it was so good and found the narrator quite engaging so if you'd prefer the audio-version over text i highly recommend it this is one of those books you don't want to pre-judge. perhaps you disliked twilight perhaps you hate love triangles or perhaps you have an aversion to sci-fi. i would still recommend giving this book a chance i'm glad i

lean mean six chapters with the rest covering hyperspace warped space polar coordinates and basic vector mathematics.the quizzes are pretty good for reinforcing the concepts...they actually make you

each chapter has a clear purpose and a mini-timeline, differences in text size and shape mark off the sections and subsections and there are even inserts every few pages with primary sources this actually helped me mentally organize the details of what was happening - there's a lot to keep track of in centuries!a few elements that i really liked graphic organizers and visuals the author occasionally made use of graphic organizers - for example representing the hierarchy of byzantine governments with a table or showing the decline in value of the nomismata in the th century in addition rather than banishing the images to an appendix the author actually integrates them into the relevant sections of the text it's a pleasant surprise to find a historian who actually appreciates the value of a good illustration to you know illustrate history.2 breadth this is a broad history - the focus is not just on the emperors or on constantinople but on the empire as a whole i appreciate that the author takes the time to explore social and economic trends art literature and ordinary life.3 historiography the author cites other scholars and also talks about both debates and shifts in understanding the best example was his take on the blues vs greens fights of the thoth centuries according to the author while older scholars often tried to impose a religious class or political ideology on these fights it's better to view the blues and greens as the late antiquity version of football hooligans who liked to riot as a non-expert, it's actually helpful for me to understand how scholarship has changed.4 the last chapter is about post-byzantine byzantine culture most byzantine histories that i read use the last chapter to eulogize the fallen empire in contrast this author actually explores what happened to byzantine culture after the ottoman conquest i appreciate that the author acknowledges that the greeks armenians and slavs didn't just magically stop practicing their culture after great general history would recommend it to anyone new to the byzantine fandom","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"great insight","text":"great insight.

him grow up and start taking an interest in girls horowitz has managed to take a series that could become quite stale with the same character and same spy elements and make it continue to develop.this novel is more bloody than the first two novels in the same way that the harry potter series became more adult as it progressed i'd still say that children could read it but not those with impressionable minds or those who were likely to be scared if they enjoyed the first two novels this is certainly not too much of a step forward","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":5.0,"title":"the

did to poor ella they locked her up and made her a servant to them,etc you know the story so people charge them more for less and they run low on money so bad things happen.the story really focuses on one stepsister though both are part of the whole story isabelle is the main character and the one that longs the most to be beautiful because she feels that to be beautiful is all it takes to get what you want in the world like ella so when she meets a fairy god mother of sorts that's what she says she wants the most so when she is told she needs to do somethings before her wish can be granted she sets out to do them.on the other side she has \"fate\" and \"chance\" betting on her each comes into play as a person in her life how they play their part is for you to find out.so much is going on and happening in this book i'm not even touching the surface this book is packed full of story it has some girl power themes running through it that are really good with some strong messages for young and old alike it has so many good things going for it if i were to say anything negative at all it would be that i have to admit at one or two points i got pulled out of the story a little bit i'm not sure if there was just so much going on it got distracting or if at a few points there was a lull that just stalled it either way it picked back up and got real good again!all in all this is an

something specifically for female musicians however by the midas a significant number of guitar-driven bands with one or more female musicians had made waves on the scene white zombie the breeders verruca salt smashing pumpkins jewels hole cheryl crowd etc.. and today a higher percentage of women can be seen in the local music scenes and even in working in musical instrument stores.tish ciravolo took advantage of this new target audience and created daisy rock a line of guitars and basses created for female musicians not only are they made to look more \"girly\", but since women are physically different than men the guitars also have a different contour in the body and the length is scaled smaller it was a smart move on ciravolo's part and one that was long overdue for women who want to start playing guitar or bass i highly recommend checking these outfit was all because of daisy rock's success that ciravolo was approached to write a guitar book hence girl's guitar method\". it's a guitar booked for beginners with some flowery graphics and...well, unfortunately that's about it.in and of itself the book is a decent guitar lesson book it includes what you normally find in other guitar books tablature readings instructions on how to tune construction of chords a chord dictionary and modern examples alternative music and the like to listen and play to structured into lessons that start at the most basic level and get increasingly advanced but strip away the curvy fonts and other girly doodles and you're left with a book that's really no different from the numerous other guitar books on the market today to me that makes the title rather deceiving especially to those just starting on the instrument.in all fairness i don't see how one could write guitar lessons for women specifically it would be like trying to write a book called amen's crochet method\", by taking a random crochet book and putting freddy kreuger's sweater on the front cover maybe an

knew him are juxtaposed with sudden references to \"i\" egg jobs says he liked king learn and i asked him why he related to king lear...\" if this is an interview write it as such if it's a biography as touted then please remove yourself from it oh writer the sentences are stilted forced and lack any creativity a pure statement of facts--a facts sheet if you will--would read more eloquently than this work of non-fiction. as it stands now steve jobs is a cobbled patchwork of facts with conjunctions and prepositional phrases thrown in to link them it's downright painful to read.if one were unaware that this was a published biography and merely read it under the misrepresentation that a high school student turned it in for their english class project it would be both believable and highly defensible the wisdom of steve jobs is lost in the hands of this professional writer\", who casts a murky haze over the biography just as a death shroud obscures a corpse it is so poorly constructed so rudimentary in its prose that it can only come \"alive\" in television sound bites where it barely breathes with gasping shallow respirations, as if it was a boat-landed carp.a powerful operatic aria for mr jobs the one all apple fans long for this work is not.mr. jobs accepted this biography unreviewed and unedited mr isaacson was given free reign this degree of candor is appreciated from mr jobs but god rest his soul perhaps he should have asked for an advanced copy if for no other reason than to have his own apple marketing department perform lifesaving surgery to repair it into something readable and intelligent it certainly would have made reading this page doorstop more enjoyable.as it is now the message of the genius jobs is undecipherable in the apple sauce of this text it is quite concerning that the new york literati down at simon schuster publishing house would allow this unedited drone into the print shop perhaps releasing it in the month of steve's passing was more important than making it an actual book.books are meant to be read and enjoyed now and forever and serve as a basis of learning for current and future generations this biography my dear readers serves little purpose other than as a weight to hold down my papers when i open my window.this is a sad tribute to an imaginative icon the writing is dreadfully uninspired.i

feel like i have to explain the 3-star because in spite of that seemingly middling rank i still very much want another book because this book hints at the potential of a much better book to come.yet for this book the plot is a mix of paranormal and murder mystery and from the very first page the reader knows that there is tension with daughters missing then it flows into what may seem the starting spot wherein the lead protagonist eve short for revelation which is a family name maskalyne, kills her magician husband jeremy when the gun she normally used for a magic trick is switched with a real loaded gun.there is a bit plasticity to these opening scenes and frankly i was glad to be out of vegas and in five corners and haley so the real story begins the man who killed her husband is still stalking them so eve returns to her hometown at the urging of her grandmother she also takes back her maiden name of dyer it isn't just to camouflage herself and her daughters but also a return to a tradition of the dyer women using their maiden names.i liked how szarlan also brings in the viewpoints of the daughters year old grace and faith along with ten year old rayleigh even though most of the book is told from first person narration of reve.once eve and family are back in five corners eve begins to piece together her family legacy and how it may affect her it also leads her back to her childhood friend and first love who is now the chief of police in hawley. not that eve is fully ready for a romance so soon after losing her husband but the connection is there nonetheless.interesting parts of the book is when szarlan tantalizes with the use of magic but she also ups the tension with the addition of another murder of revels college friend many years prior at first this addition seems tacked on but it actually does work later in the story.my issue with the story is that there just seems a little too much going on that there were times when i'd get mixed up with the different revelations we never really get more of the was vegas situation the main 'villain' never really feels like much of a threat we know he's a problem early on but once we get to the revelation it is thin and under-explained so i felt a let down at the end that i can't quite shake off.but again the potential is there for a solid series more use of american history and folklore and how the dyer line figures into it more development for the daughters who also have magic in them just more development for all the characters as eve digs more into her legacy and the towns as

as much as the first there were lot of main characters to keep track of and a very complex storyline involving several mysteries which were resolved in the end as others noted there was an odd and confusing nonlinear section toward the end which slowed things down there was also lot more sex and while i'm not a prude i felt it was a disappointing dumming-down element or a caving-in to trends.while i hated the character of anna in the first book she was okay here the siren character was more emotionally open and still as likeable much to my surprise i adored the child character i usually despise and avoid them at least in american novels but this kid was a joy to read and i hope she will appear in the next book 5 stars for her 3 for the overall novel i liked it but unlike dinosaur feather i will not keep it in my library to read again i will however eagerly anticipate s.j. kazan's next novel and buy it as soon as it's available in english

wanna be gangsta. it's not clear to me what the point of this book is for a number of years i worked at a small alternative store some of the people who frequented the shop identified as punk the difference between street kids who created their own punk style and the suburban kids who bought their style at hot topics in the mall was glaringly obvious similarly every fall my town hosts one of the larger biker gatherings in the u.s. the difference between hard core outlaw bikers and the accountantsdoctorsdentists who ride their \"hogs\" on weekends to pretend they are outlaw is equally glaring guthrie dylan and the author were not poor or working class they all came from comfortable money with guthrie and dylan both posing as something they were not to his credit guthrie tried to live the life he sang about he actually joined the struggle to change things and stayed with it throughout his life until his illness stopped him dylan on the other hands seems to have consciously decided early on to stay away from any real political involvement so he appears to be a strange choice to illuminate our political history and the very real anger which grows out of it that's why it seems to me that this book is really about the angst of two teenage boys the author's in his suburban childhood and dylan's in his younger days real adult anger in the sense this book tries but fails to convey would not only rail against injustice but would also do something about it preferably over the long haul.if you want to see what genuine political anger looks like i would suggest two books to start the first would be naomi klein's the shock doctrine which will give you the brutally ugly history of the united states from the is to the present a history that you rarely if ever hear in this country as a side comment i would note that klein is also a dedicated activist who acts on her politics the second book is marge pierce's city of darkness city of light a searing novel about the french revolution she dissects with an angry scalpel how the king the nobility the liberal middle class and the radicals all squabbled and bickered among themselves for power while the working class and the poor went hungry again and again i would also have to comment that while i know nothing of pierce's personal life a number of her novels are very political burning with anger with vision and with hope.there are several other things to add about daniel wolf's book he ends on some grim notes guthrie's activism wound down in the is while mccarthyism was raging full force the last chapter of the book details the harsh economic realities of our times - the collapse of the union movement as well as the growing poverty and income inequality there are some key things his angst misses thought first it's clear now that political change in this country moves in waves there are periods of intense activism as well as lulls candor times of repression second even with that ebbing and flowing it's also clear that real change has been happening slavery women as chattel and child labor are all gone after some hard fought long drawn out battles there is still much much that has to be done but there have been real improvements for women for children for people of color and for our lgbtq communities.finally, as grim as things are economically and politically right now the core truth of today is that we are at a significant crossroads for all of humanity the climate change clock is ticking whatever climate deniers wish to believe we either change things now or we destroy the earth's systems that sustain human life daniel wolff does not even begin to address that reality in this book even so that's where the real grown up anger of today needs to be focused and needs to be actually doing something.p.s. this is not a verified purchase because i got the book from my local library","symbols":""},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"i really wish she didn't write this","text":"i really

individual reviews for night world 4 dark angel night world 5 the chosen and night world 6 soulmate.i would give this collection a 3-3.5 out of 5. smith continues her night world series with gillian and a guardian angel rachel the vampire-hunter with a vampire soulmate, and hannah and thierry, the original soulmates.night world 4 dark angel by la ja smithat first dark angel doesn't seem like a typical night world book gillian lennon is a normal teenager someone that many teen girls could probably relate too she's not one of the popular crowd but instead is a shy outcast her two goals in life are somewhat superficial she wants to be popular and she wants david blackburn to love her but then who wasn't superficial when they were a teen?gillian's introduction to the night world comes when she has a near death experience on her way home from school she goes into the snowy woods after she thinks she hears a child crying instead she falls into a creek and hypothermia sets in but she's rescued by angel a celestial being who guides gillian back to the road but angel turns out to be more than just a lifesaver as he starts to help gillian fulfill her goals he whispers the secrets of popularity in her earn helping a shy girl transform into a vivacious butterfly but as gillian's status increases at school she starts to become suspicious of her guardian angel...who is he really and what does he want with david?the night world connection in this book is tenuous but it does make sense after all in a world populated with werewolves vampires and other supernatural creatures it's natural that spirits would exist as well so far gillian is probably the most identifiable of all the protagonists in the night world books as she's your everyday teenage girl who finds out that there's a secret world...and she's part of it how many of us have wished for that i know i have.for me dark angel is a solid chapter in the night world series but it doesn't really stand out but then it isn't bad either it's a good story of growth..night world 5 the chosen by la ja smithwhen she's 5 years old rachel sees her mother and her friend killed by a vampire the vampire tries to get her as well but even at 5 she's strong enough to resist his mind control fast forward twelve years and rachel is a vampire hunter existing on the fringes of the day and the night worlds keeping humans safe.rashel is a very strong character comfortable in her body and determined because of her past she's a great fighter and has a sense of honor when she and a group of vampire hunters capture a vampire the others want to torture him but rachel can't stomach torturing a defenseless being even if he is a vampire so she decides to let him go...and then discovers he's her soulmate. to add to the mix the vampire is quinn known throughout the night world as one of the most soulless human-hating vampires around.while rachel is one of my favorite night world characters i find the plot of this book a little weak rachel stumbles into a night world slave trade of humans when she rescues a blonde bunny but then daphne the girl she helps is willing to risk her life to help rachel take down the operation the ending is very abrupt as well without taking care of some loose ends that i would've liked to see resolved but overall the chosen fits very nicely into the night world series and uses the soulmate principle that ties all the books together very nicely rachel and quinn are iconic of the opposites attract cliche, but it works for them and they grow over the short time period of the book i really want to see more of them..night world 6 soulmate, by la ja smithhannah snow has the perfect life - she's about to graduate from high school she already has a college scholarship and she even knows that she wants to be a paleontologist but her perfect life starts to collapse when she finds notes that she doesn't remember writing warning her of a dire event - dead before seventeen.\"increasingly disturbed by the notes and bad dreams hannah visits a psychiatrist on her very first appointment a werewolf crashes into the building and tries to attack her but a mysterious voice in her head helps her dodge each claw swipe she's saved by the arrival of a second werewolf who chases off the first.knowing that she has to get to the root of what's going on hannah and the psychiatrist try hypnosis and she's plunged into a vision of a past life where she was hana, and a strange boy with blood around his mouth appears in her village...thierry is one of the oldest vampires in the world created at the dawn of humanity he's spent his lifetime searching for his soulmate, trying to find her before her th birthday so he can break a cycle of death but when he finds her this time she doesn't want his help...\"soulmate\" is my favorite night world book coming th in the series it exemplifies the soulmate principle smith has used in each previous book because hannah and thierry are the original soulmates. hanna's past lives are a great plot device because it allows smith to give her lots of growth and abilities and i really enjoy the stories of her past lives i wish smith had done more with that she alludes to some interesting incarnations of hannah but only fills in a few like other night world heroines hanna's no wilting flower and she does take matters into her own hands when she needs to also in \"soulmate\" smith starts to introduce a bigger theme if classic theme saving the world and it'll be interesting to see where she takes it.if you read any of the other in the night world series this book will also give a good update on what your favorite couples are up to and what they are trying to do..","symbols":"========="},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"poor book","text":"poor book. this is a book by a person who clearly has no real world experience in the word of digital forensic

dog training advice like a trainer without being a trainer she has no credentials to be doing so and should not be doing so giving advice on dog reactivity through a book especially when you aren't a trainer is dangerous and frankly quite stupid and her advice for finding a trainer via social media and google come on anyone worth their salt would know to point people towards a site like iacp or another place where people can find trainers who have been reviewed by other trainers instead of by their instagram and facebook buddies this is another thing that tells me she really doesn't know what she's talking about on the training front.and then the minimal actual hiking advice... what about the info one needs for truly exploring the backcountry and not just the highly trafficked trails near home what should folks do when they encounter a bull moose mountain goat or black bear with their dog how about a group with a pack mule or a group of people on horseback what's the etiquette around dirt bikes and atvs? where can we find rattlesnake aversion training and where is that necessary how much more of an effect do my dogs have on wildlife off leash vs on leash and how should i make the choice to leash or not leash them based on where i am even where there are no leash rules these are all things i've encountered and had to consider while traveling with my dogs and i'm not

expose yourself to the charge of you just didn't get it you cretin.' i admit that both aspects of that statement may be true but i didn't get jonathan deeds latest book the locals.\"dee's latest novel takes on the american sense of untethered isolation in the wake of 9-. using shifting perspectives that jump with alarming frequency - kind of like the evil demon in the denzel washington movie \"fallen,\" who jumps from person to person with a tap on the shoulder the novel's perspective jumps quickly from character to character - dee gets inside the lives of a bunch of small town massachusetts residents and everyone is more or less unhappy bitter and irritated with everyone else.the opening chapter - essentially a prologue - sets the tone the narrator for this chapter is a young jerk looking to benefit from a class action lawsuit while covering up his legal issues arising from his . . . indiscretions what becomes clear is that even though he is in manhattan hours after the attacks he couldn't care less - he's just out for himself and he sees everyone else in the world as a waste of space this sets an unsettling tone for the rest of the book which i suppose is more or less the point.the 'hero' of this story mark firth bumps into the prologue narrator as he is also looking to get some money from the class action lawsuit - a bunch of folks have been victimized by a complex swindled a contractor in howland, massachusetts mark has bungled his family's finances and while everyone back home is initially elated that he survived , mark is all too aware of his family's precarious financial straits but he finds a potential windfall when an eccentric millionaire moves to town and hires mark to do a bunch of seemingly needless work at his home.i'll leave further plot details to others and for you to discover but the overall point of the story is that life in lowland is rather unpleasant the town is not thriving and people seem motivated more by jealousy and frustration than anything else the plot - involving development and small-town politics - moves so slowly that it is secondary to both character and setting and neither the characters nor the setting ever become all that interesting again perhaps this is me but if i want to hear about petty jealousies and frustrations i can see plenty of those in my daily life there is nothing in this book that takes these petty issues to a more interesting place or puts a sufficiently comic spin on them to make the locals that interesting.dee is a respected writer so this review probably says more about me than about him but for me the locals ends with a whimpers but i really liked the ending","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"three stars","text":"three stars. good deal on a good

person narrative twists and turns acting as a commentary on a day in the life of a ballerina while this would certainly appeal to anyone who has secretly or outwardly coveted tutus point shoes or just has a gold ballet slipper charm on a nostalgic bracelet howrey adds mental stress to kate's already precariously balanced sense of physical and psychological well-being by injecting a more-talented yet less stable sister for whom kate feels a mixture of envy compassion and guilt.all of the siblings of the crane family have risen to be some sort of performance stars brother keith a professional tennis player calls his family from tennis circuit destinations from around the world gwen the other ballerina dances with such ease she immediately is placed in a starring role in fact she seems to do everything with her own particular effortless grace including moving in on kate's boyfriends sleeping with them and calling them her own is there any wonder that kate would feel some impetus to not only be successful but to excel beyond normal expectations kate's opportunity to become a principal comes only when gwen's instability challenges her very sanity gwen is hospitalized and kate takes her place on the stage her success is tinged with feelings of regret guilt and the sense of being second best.as kate goes about her daily routine of classes and performances her mind floods with thoughts of her sister she knows she should view her with compassion yet her need to be a star in her own right revels in her sister's absence when kate hurts her neck while performing in swan lake which will call to mind asinbkkyem black swan her subsequent dependence on drugs along with the normal stresses of sustaining the athleticism of her ballet the knowledge that a career of dance is ephemeral and her insecurity with herself reign supreme in her mind and she begins to spiral down the same black hole as her sister.howrey, once a member of a ballet company herself presents the disjointed world of ballet and performance art in general for the competitive microcosm that it is however difficult it may be to follow kate's narrative at times as it wanders with her mind in a circuitous crane's dance howrey's allusion to theseus's movements in and out of the minotaur's labyrinth her voice rings true and a view of this world from the inside is revealed warts and all in terms of a compelling story however the disjointedness of kate's emotional unravelling as detailed by her mind calling up past and present moments can be confusing and does stop the flow of the actual plot.kate's relationship with a young ballerina wannabe is especially poignant she is flattered by bryce's fascination with her but is reluctant to push her into a life of grueling routine insecurity

so that i tracked this book down and read it.writing stylesimplistic. too detailed in some places not detailed enough in others there were parts that seemed superfluous and sections where the drama was high but the writing wasn't good enough to capture the moment which is a darn shame because ms didonato has accomplished some simply amazing things.as for the book in it's entiretyfor me this book seemed to fall into 3 parts the first part was interesting but not riveting stuff it served it's purpose though as it formed the background for the second part which had me on the edge of my seat this section dealt with the most difficult parts of tiffanie's surgeries and i found it an inspiring example of human courage and strength.this was followed unfortunately by a poorly crafted description of her life after the big surgery i found part of this so vaguely described that it wasn't 'satisfying'. while another part was so oddly personal that it bordered on creepy --to me at least others might find it spoiler alert spoiler alert...endearing that she went shopping with her mother for sexy outfits and that she got carried away with fantasizing about her night-to-come in the dressing room.end of spoilerin the end i concluded that i like tiffanie. that she had guts and that self-promotion was all apart of the package and that i was good with that but i almost wish this book had been from her mother's perspective for if tiffanie was iron her mother was steel.honestly, as a mother i don't know if i could have been as strong as mrs didonato. holy cow i can't imagine what it must take to

and over we must be told that jean auden took drugs over and over we must be told that there were six children from the first marriage of peggy she's father and her mother had two so that made eight children.the book is poorly written and confusing some of the paragraphs have sentences that don't even belong in those paragraphs or the sentences themselves were confusing there are a lot of exclamation points used in the dialogue and in ms rules own observations or opinions some of content especially peggy she's resume appears to be lifted straight from newspaper articles it would be interesting to find out the neurosis that possessed peggy to destroy her marriage to mark allen that was like killing the goose that laid the golden eggs it must have been control and power that she wanted and she had such a huge ego she thought she could have all that and the money too unfortunately for her mark allen did not care to be controlled.i don't know if russel was a bad guy or not his

more than a decade and a journalist trying to find out how she got there.the next gone girl absolutely not.amy stevenson is a typical teenager - until she is brutally attacked and left for dead she survives but is in a coma amy serves as one of the novels narrators and the reader is privy to her private thoughts and hopes to gain clues about her attacker.our other narrators include amy boyfriend at the time of her attack and a journalist alex dale the story unfolds as each character lends their own insight on amy attack.this book in my opinion commits the major sin of any mystery novel - it leaves out all the mystery if your looking for twists and turns hiding around every page turn - it wont happen the story is pretty straight forward from beginning to end and the reader easily sees whats coming.amys voice could be a strong addition to the story telling but it completely misses the mark most of her narration is irrelevant as she doesn't realize shes in a coma at all and spends her chapters wondering where people are and why shes sleeping so much its a major disappointment to not have amy character be a stronger voice most of her chapters could be edited out and not have effect on the outcome of the novel.alex dale is a highly dysfunctional alcoholic shes lost her unborn child husband and job due to her addictions alex is grasping every last straw on a road to redemption and feels a connection to amy and her untold story alex is such an alcoholic that she wears diapers to bed because she blacks out so completely at night that she wakes to having wet the bed yet shes supposed to be able to launch an investigation into a year old case and solve amy case not gonna happen.the one redeeming quality of the novel is actually the writing for a story that misses its mark - its actually well written every novelist has a novel that fails to deliver and i hoping this is holly seddons. i would look forward to reading another of her works with hope that the story was a better one.try not to breath is buzzing about the literary world with a lot of hype in its wake sadly it just doesn't deliver the characters are improbable and unlikable the story has a lot of potential but it never quite makes it to the goal of being an interesting and well told in the end this one lands on solidly on the list of books to

but because i kept pausing in my listening taking a break from dialogue that was mundane and tedious.the author's examination of american middle-class life and the struggles of his characters to live with their past mistakes and with their changing society was for this listeners an exercise in patience because the characters simply did not engage me on an emotional level.the characters one and all came across as secretly spiteful individuals who beneath their achieving bourgeois exteriors suffer from some sort of low-grade depression and who take their \"struggles\" in life entirely too

absolutely must read it post apocalyptic check bond between father and son yep cannibalism ... kinda...the writing is an acquired taste in fact i started it then put it down for a couple of weeks then picked it back up and finished it if you're a fairly decent reader with good apprehension you can knock this out in a couple of hours easily and that's even rereading a few spots where you just go \"huh....?\" the writing is good in that it is very poetic in the way he describes the character's feelings and what they are seeing but it is not \"writing\" as you might be accustomed to in a novel the author skips out on quote marks when character's are talking so there's not a lot of warning that you are shifting into \"conversation\" model which is ok and easy to adjust to but he also selectively leaves out punctuation and that gets a bit annoying there are lengthy descriptions of some things that you might not find important and short anticlimactic run ins with danger where you wish he'd elaborated.and as for the cannibalism... the movie goes into more detail on that than the book i was hoping for some swan song-esque violent run ins with gangs i got oh gosh... there are some people let's hide okay we hide they left we can go.\". if you want your characters to ever be in any peril other than potentially starving to death this might not be the type of novel you are looking for it just doesn't really get the heart-rate up as you panic on behalf of the characters it feels a little like cast away did to me yes it's entertaining but honestly it's also a bit boring.i will say that i cried like a damn baby at the end oh my goodness the end really hit me harder than i thought it would probably because i have a kids but i just seriously lost it which is why it's getting 3 stars it was a great well written ending.all in all i don't regret reading it i'm actually pretty glad i got past my initial opinion of it and gave it a second shot it's a good way to kill a couple of hours but i can't say i'll be reading anything else by this author i love poetry i love novels... but i guess i just don't like the two to mix you got poetry in my novel... you got a novel

each month as well as the foundation in research on happiness and well-being.i was hoping that rubin's next book better than before would be a sort of follow-up. in some ways it is this time with rubin more specifically addressing how to manage habits in order to be more happy and satisfied unfortunately i didn't like this book nearly as much in fact i found it was a slog to get through the whole thing.my major problem with this book is something rubin addresses in her a note to the readers at the start of the book she says i see habits through the lens of my own experience so this account is colored by my particular personality and interests.\" and that is just it--i.e., rubin's \"study\" of habits is almost wholly based on what has worked for her and for people she knows her prior book utilized over-frequent quotes from her blog this one relies on anecdotal stories from her family and friends.rubin attempts to make her theories adaptable to all by coming up with a theory of what she calls the four tendencies,\" or basically four different approaches to habits she calls these the upholder questioner obliger and rebel i didn't find this model which rubin refers to throughout the book to be at all helpful whereas rubin may find herself solidly in the \"upholder\" category i personally was divided between upholder and questioner and i didn't really respond to the suggestions for either.using this basic framework rubin goes on to create many many more almost arbitrary categories are you a lark or an owl again i'm in-between. a mararthoner, sprinter or procrastinator underbuyer or overbuyer? simplicity lover or abundance lover finisher or opener familiarity lover or novelty lover promotion-focused or prevention focused small steps or big steps and all of that is only in the second chapter it felt very bogged down confusing and often irrelevant at least for me.rubin goes on to address the importance of monitoring habits and to discuss the foundation for creating habits there are some solid general tips in this section but eventually she falls back into creating forced categories such as the series of \"loopholes,\" or exceptions to habits again there are some good ideas here and there but they tend to get lost among the clutter.one of rubin's chapters is called data point of one.\" this is probably the best way to view this

other issues like past abuse and much danger can come to them in life without addressing and understanding these issues so i found ley basically took some taboo subjects and in a fun way gave men

moves way too slow. haven terra is living the typical teenager's life great school great friends great \"family\"...life is good except for the fact that she was abandoned as a baby left with scars on her chest and back luckily haven was taken in and cared for by joan a nurse and her coworkers when haven and her best friend dante along with classmate lance are whisked away for a once-in-a-lifetime internship at a soon to be opened hotelnightclub in the chicago it's a dream come true.once the internship begins the fact that something is \"off\" is quickly evident maybe it's the fact that the outfit the beyond glamorous staff act like freakish robots or the mysterious book that seems to be communicating with haven but how about the fact that aurelia her boss and lucian aurelia's next in command act plain creepy when haven discovers the secrets behind this dangerous group she faces it head on determined to save herself and those she loves.once again i find myself at odds opinion-wise, between myself and so many other readers the cover is beautiful with the right amount of foreshadowing a cover like that is sure to put a book on my radar and a lot of bloggers i know have read illuminate and have given it glowing reviews so i was excited to read this one i was primed and ready to love it but it just didn't happen for several reasons.first, i didn't feel a \"hook\", a strong plot line that grabbed my attention and demand that i read this book i knew what the hook was supposed to be it's actually spelled out in the synopsis the framework was laid out so slowly that i became bored i knew danger was coming but i honestly just wanted haven to get a clue and get on with it there wasn't this big \"aha\" moment where things suddenly got real everything haven learned was through eavesdropping and thinly veiled hints during conversations.another aspect to the story that did not connect with me was the love interest upon arrival at the hotel haven meets lucian lucian is of course impossibly gorgeous wealthy charming...you know what i'm saying i just didn't get it i don't care how hot i am for a guys if he always cancels dates disappears for days and asks me to give him my soul that's a huge dealbreaker. but maybe that's just me not haven she falls hard for lucian and keeps seeing him despite his efforts to damn her for eternity sight and yes it may be possible that the devilish lucian will have a change of heart even so that's a bridge too far to cross in my opinion.my biggest issue with illuminate is the fact that the story moved so slowly much of the \"action\" was haven running errands delivering chocolate or learning the various duties of her position she did lurk through the tunnels and crawlspaces of the hotel but not a lot came of it the revelations what there were of them came so slowly that i found myself easily distracted from the story even the big events didn't wow me.i know i sound like a complete grouch after writing this grumble grumble that is never my intention i wanted to love illuminate the author does have a nice writing style the words and dialogue flowed extremely well the book had some beautiful passages i liked haven lance and dante for the most part overall thought i found illuminate to be too long and too slow to suit my tastes.favorite quote\"after a thing like that worry becomes more than a reflex it becomes an umbrella shadowing daily life hovering closer every time someone gets home late or doesn't call when they say they will.\"pg.5, arc","symbols":""},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"the

kidnapped while lei is out on a diplomatic mission lei feels that somehow the dark side of the force must be involved though the diplomats she is meeting with suggests that it is just the local custom of kidnapping for social status and that it is part of a local tradition lei feels otherwise and she is right the children are kidnapped by the lord hethrir who takes the children and tells them their parents are dead somehow he is able to block their limited and young ability to use the force meanwhile han is on vacation with luke luke is searching for missing jedi and their travels take them close to a planet which is slowly dying and turning to crystal this is messing with luke's ability to sense with the force and vonda mcintyre gives the reader a very different spin on luke skywalker. rather than the hero we have a despondent and sluggish man who is not thinking rationally it is a different spin on skywalker and may be disappointing to many readers luke is less of a presence in this novel anyway as the focus is more on the kids in captivity and lena's attempts to rescue them luke and han are almost a side plot which eventually gets pulled into the main storyline as it all comes together in a mess of villainy.my biggest problem with the crystal star is that it focused far too much attention on the solo children sure they will eventually become major players in the star wars universe and sure the readers needs to be introduced to the characters so they don't just show up one novel as fully formed characters who we have not had the chance to get to know but i think anacin is three years old which would put jacen and jain around five unless anacin is only two i'm not sure but they are a bit too young to get such a large role roger macbride allen did a far better job with the children in the corellian trilogy which was only set a year or so after this novel they're no under wigging i'll say that much.after the children my complaints have to do with the storytelling there is nothing wrong with having luke's mission go poorly but everything felt rushed lei spent so much time wanting to find her children but not really following them until all of a sudden she knows exactly where they are and the kids and everyone end up in the same place with han and luke sorry i guess that is a bit of a spoiler but come on now really the novel might have been better served by focusing sole on lei and the children with perhaps a cameo at best of han and luke not the wasted chapters with no real story development though we do get a bit of hands past came to light.bottom line even fans of the star wars novels should skip this one it does nothing or little to build on future stories a minor character or two from this book may appear in future volumes as jedi and it does not resolve any ongoing storylines. the book is essentially self-contained and reading a basic summary would be just as enjoyable as reading this novel.-joe

has become commonplace on a rare weekend drive from their home in nyx to the \"country\"--aka rural pennsylvannia--they spy an old house with which they both fall in love francie, because it appeals

not quite believable given the circumstnaces. this is even more true for their neighbors randy who acts in a manner which is completely out of character--although this is acknowledged within the book it still seems unreasonable more interesting and engaging are the house's original occupants the musgroves, who built adencourt one hundred and fifty years before the author weaves the tale of the

grip me like most tend to do it want bad by any means... it was just rather dry perhaps a bit too drawn out with the insouts of research i cant put my finger on it yet.note, give not seen more than a couple episodes of genealogy roadshow give not seen the episode in which the author appears so i have not a preference towards what aired vs whats in the book moving on...i found the story premise an interesting one being a greek who is the fairest member of the family has put me on the receiving end of the what are you questionespecially as an awkward looking child it bothered me then especially since i didn't understand what was being asked.unfortunately, genealogy itself bores me to tears give actually attempted to do research however as a screenwriter i tend to gravitate towards stories that jump off the page i was unable to feel that save for very specific parts of this book i felt the authors longing for questions that will forever go unanswered at least by the woman shed most like to answer them and yet just like the author were left with enough speculation about people well never know.trying to follow the family tree of so so why there important to a persons personal narrative is likely incredibly interesting to people naturally interested in genealogy but for someone like me speculation bits pieces of stories fall flat.the author makes some excellent points about the way americans look at discuss race the book also raises plenty of questions that likely will cause the majority of readers to consider as they relate to their own lives what they believe know vs the whole truth in this way i absolutely find great value in white like her.as a memoir that feels as though it breathes new life in to family members long deceased well it didn't strike that chord for me as an only child with one parent in their final months - year of life the other affected by parkinson's disease i have been more interested in family memoirs now more than ever before i wouldn't change having read this but i also cant say i recommend it above many others.if you love genealogy this is probably a great choice if you don't your not interested in trying to follow stories about how someones mother passed for white left her relatives to do so later her daughter ends up on a quest to tell you why shes looking for information on her rd great grandparent and giving you seemingly

so when she was summoned back to the family farm she would have refused if her grandfather had not told her that her cousin allegra was missing after lane returned and began searching for allegra she found only more dark secrets about her family and the repercussions of those secrets to other innocent lives.there are many excellent aspects of this novel the characters are interesting and lane in particular is quite appealing the descriptions of the isolated town and claustrophobic small town in kansas is quite well done the basic premise of the story is distasteful but is understandable given the setting and characters the author has used the currently popular technique of telling parallel stories from different points of view and in different times skillfully to tell this story.unfortunately there are also some problems with this novel as well it seemed obvious to me what was going on in this family long before the novel got there making most of the book rather anti

i'm in the midst of a story that's really working for me it doesn't take that long i'm giving it three stars because it was good but i didn't think it was a terribly clever ready i thought it started badly paragraph one should come with a spoiler alert i spent at least half the book waiting to see what would happen to merit badges after i found out that she was going to pay the price for the signature on the contract with the russian it was just a matter of how many pages i had to turn to get my reward and that's a shame because i really like the legal aspect of the book and i definitely loved the golf interest but i found myself trying to speed through also the book started badly because i thought the main character had a stupid name apparently somebody in publishing likes it because there's a whole series of books with merit in them that being said i thought the main character was well developed and generally a pretty smooth character i enjoyed some of the less easily anticipated turns in the story - such as who the \"enforcer\" turned out to be and i also appreciated the main character being an intelligent woman who was not really judged by the younger man she kept company with i thought the title of the book was smart appealing and a great indication of what the book is really about mark green's flashback was a flashback for me too did i read that twice it felt like

normally associated with mexico the message is objectionable the free form verse is based on statements made by the artist diego rivera which they concede may or may not be true the author advances river's embrace of communism and violence as the only alternatives to vicious and tyrannical leadership the tacit approval of terrorism is genuinely offensive especially in light of the brutality experienced at the boston marathon the verse brags on page that he blew up trains and bemoans his failed assassination attempt on the then mexican president moreover his treatment of women leaves much to be desired apparently it is fine to lie and cheat and have multiple affairs while married rivera certainly was not designed for fatherhood telling his partner at one point he will throw the child out the window if it disturbs him.it is a pity that this book is not focused on what made him famous his art it is unfortunate that the author did not use his life as an opportunity to discuss the more challenging elements including politics poverty and morality instead there is just blanket approval the verses focus on many ugly things the deaths of babies throwing the baby artist in a dung

groups and nations of potentially poisonous fugue blowfish dishes and of japanese tribe ceramic art.the plot itself is a superficial private-detective procedural with action scenes pretty much limited to investigator jim brodie's personal martial arts encounters with a japanese assassin some fbiciahas strongmen and a district of columbia \"fixer\". the story skips quite discreetly over brodie's \"action\" with his new girlfriend ries. rather distressingly brodie seems quite indifferent to the deaths of various policemen and bodyguard employees who lose their lives while guarding brodie candor his clients.in the novel brodie a san-francisco-based japanese art dealer and half-owner of an inherited tokyo private security firm is called to a papa valley crime scene to translate the chanting of a japanese child whose father has just been murdered the victim turns out to be the son of brodie's artist friend ken nobuki, who is due to arrive soon in san francisco to kick off an international art trading agreement the pacific rim friendship program prfp. there is no obvious motive for the murder.when exiting an inaugural prep meeting at san francisco's city hall brodie and nobuki are pinned down by a sniper's fire from atop the nearby asian art museum brodie escapes without injury but nobuki is shot in the head and is hospitalized for the duration of the novel after brodie thwarts an assassin's attempt to finish off nobuki at the hospital brodie arranges for protection of nobuki's daughter naomi an anti-nuclear-power agitator who is in washington dc naomi may be targeted for death by the japanese nuclear mafia that has been whitewashing the fukushima nuclear power disaster and making only cosmetic changes to the management of nuclear power facilities in the aftermath of the disaster.brodie then flies to japan--leaving his young daughter with a neighbor at very short notice--and sets the employees of brodie security to work on protecting nobuki's family members and on identifying the reasons behind the apparent ongoing attempt to wipe out the entire nobuki family brodie shows himself to be quite oblivious to personal danger even though his firm's reputation and that of its employees hinges on his remaining alive.although the story's ending is somewhat surprising the plot usually just plods along following brodie's investigative activities and his martial arts fights brodie's character is rather thin--his fatherly thoughts and arrangements for his daughter's upbringing and safety aren't particularly convincing and his background doesn't seem to fully support his awesome martial arts prowess in fact i didn't like brodie well enough to want to read the other series books even though i'm generally a sucker for any mysterythriller with a

there is a bit of jekyll and hyde a feeling of frankenstein in the sections that deal with reanimation and a love story of sorts in between the unusual main character which has a very mixed cultural background brought a lot to this story in my opinion making in unique in yet another way.impressive descriptions of the city and the especially the shops led the way to interesting connections with the family at the center of this novel i particularly liked the good vs evil feeling of a character more or less struggling to gain control over their own demons.i did feel that this book had steep drop offs where the every day actions of the characters took over the story for pages at a time the novel redeemed itself whenever something exciting would happen but there are some rather long stretches where nothing much is going on.the author does a good job of painting a background for her characters that is both believable and enticing she raises questions about them throughout this novel never answering them all at the end there is definitely room for another book if one has not been written already.some liberties were certainly taken with the rearranging of facts and dates to accommodate the needs of the writer but i think for the most part it worked pretty well.overall, i thought this was an intriguing story and a book that fans of gothic literature will be happy to check

had family living there but i sure was surprised to see an error especially since it was a chapter heading it looks like real research wasn't done but just copied for other places where original

in stillwater but the first drive-in restaurant itself was definitely in shawnee and the top hate as it says in the book was not a chain there was one little drive-in hamburger joint in shawnee in front of a restaurant the log house and owned by the same two guys troy smith and joe mckimmey. they started their venture about . troy wanted to concentrate on the drive-in and use a new concept he'd seen in california the electronic speaker joe wanted to stick with the restaurant so the he bought out troy they couldn't use the top hat name because they discovered a couple of others places already named that which had nothing to do with troy's business so he coined the name \"sonic.\" he was building the one in shawnee when he also bought a place in stillwater and they got the first \"signage.\" in through early is both the top hat and the sonic were in existence i know this because my dad was a one time law partner with joe mckimmey who was going to law school while he ran the

the boy next door she hasn't seen him for years but she has the biggest crush on him and when she sees him she is almost instantly in love with him after a whole lot of flirting she finds out he has a girlfriend so she's bummed about that she's lost her last best friend when her boyfriend kissed her and well lets just say this book has a lot of boy craziness that aside there are a few or at least one friendship in the book and maybe a lesson is learned in it somewhere i will admit i wasn't a fan of the main character at the end of the book even for their ages some things are just a bit unlikeable however there really is a lot to like about this book i swear it!it's not a bad book it's an easy read and again very well written i would look at some of the other reviews maybe and go by

cabot to resemble the movie to actually show her dealing with being a princess think again this is just another teen romance and not a very good one at that and should stay on the shelves.true, i admit that i saw the movie first and so came to the book with certain expectations for example i envisioned reading about how tough becoming a princess can be for us average people but how sweet mia overcomes the challenge with awkwardness and humor i also anticipated reading pages upon pages about how mia is trained in all the proper royal etiquette such as how to sit walk dance dress and talk next despite how cloche the plotline sounds i expected mia to eventually endear herself to her the royal staff incite the jealousy of popular students and develop closer bonds with true friends i wanted the story i saw on screen.yet sometimes a book is better than the movie and so i think i could have lived with a different book if not for all its flaws from page one until the end mia complains about her life in this way mia is like the girl we see on the screen except in the book she also swears lies about most everything and basically just seems more crude she also struggles in school frequently copies her homework off others and disdains most of her teachers she likes to shop wants to be popular and does not have any interest in doing anything with her life except to date while these may be on the top of the list for many girls the emphasis on them in the book makes it difficult for me to believe that she would have the ability to be a princess.even at this point i probably could have forgiven the book except for one major drawback the whole premise of the book is that mia learns she is heir to the royal throne this could have made for a worthy twist except we rarely see mia being trained to be a princess remove a few lines here and there that refer to her royal family or obligations and you wouldn't even know that mia was training to become a princess

published under a christian publishing house and spends some time throwing a christian message into the mix i have no problem with that and enjoy some christian novels but this seemed forced to me it

be immoral and very shallow all i could think about was the couple's baby trevor and how he had a devious mother in emily so for me the author did a good job.the storyline is about nate and emily who have left new york because nate's job although a good job can't take care of all the family's needs in manhattan the couple have an apartment rent of . per month and his salary is stretched with the demands of living in new york i did not feel sympathy for the couple because they feel they have been exiled to newport rhode island i wanted to jump into that book and tell them to be glad for what they did have.nate has found another job and has enough money to buy the family a house in newport emily and nate but especially emily are ashamed that they have to leave their life behind in new

after a short stint of job interviews corinne has a revelation that she would be happier as a small business owner and gets to work getting a government grant to start a company that provides household services for busy executive men.as one might expect corinne is lucky enough to get a grant a loan and unemployment to start her small company somewhat unexpectedly her primary helper is a

her decision making abilities take a strong turn for the worse this leads corinne into an awkward encounter with a dead man which is the \"mystery\" part of the story however corinne is never actually frightened of the corpse just frustrated and stressed so the mystery is really more of a case of hijinks than a crime.as in most stories of this type corinne overcomes challenges and obstacles to win success lose and win back her friends and decides that she doesn't really like her former boyfriend all that much but is unexpectedly drawn to someone new dust angel is a light and charming story--a

and lacked the characteristic wit and charm that i've come to associate with rodale's usually well-written historical romances.lady amelia cavendish the heroine of chasing lady amelia,\" was first introduced in lady bridget's diary,\" 1 in this series in that book amelia had disappeared for a day before returning to her family not sharing a single detail of where she'd been or what she'd done during her time of disappearance knowing that chasing lady amelia was going to fill in this gap i was eager to hear amelia's story how disappointing then to read about amelia's day and realize that it was just going to go on and on i don't want to include any spoilers so i will just say that i was bored with the entire storyline and the chemistry between amelia and the hero was lacking.i hope that 3 in this series lady claire is all that,\" will be much better i'm still willing to give rodale's books a chance because i've ready many of her books and always been entertained and charmed i'm going to call chasing lady amelia an anomaly and hope for the best for rodale's future books","symbols":""},{"label":-1,"rating":1.0,"title":"be warned missing multimedia","text":"be warned missing

from there the story really just takes off and you get to see so many struggles from inside the family to things as big as prejudices and exile.so much happens in the novel i can't even begin to touch on everything without making this review a mini novel it's such an expansive and immersive story that you can't help but get hooked and invested in the lives of these characters this story will make tear you up at times and make you laugh at other one thing it definitely will do is make you thankful for the things you do have.i would recommend this to anyone that is interested in it from what they have heard about it in general and those that are into generational family sagas it's a very good story and one that won't soon be forgotten","symbols":""},{"label":1,"rating":3.0,"title":"cute small book with some interesting photos several are repeated through the book though","text":"cute small book with some interesting photos several are repeated through the book though. i like the idea of snow but as a native west texans i have zero interest in actually being in snow so this little book caught my eye as a way to see the beauty of a snowy landscape without having to actually be cold and miserable.there are some really lovely photos on these pages and some mediocre pictures i do love the laundry list of new york city architecture and many of the photos highlight some very interesting architectural styles it's a shame this is a physically small book rather than a true coffee table book because there are several pictures that would have been better served by being larger so we could really see the details my primary reason for the one star deduction is for the repetition of many of the same photos - they are repeated several pages later in a different size i can't believe that the photographer and editor couldn't come up with enough unique photos of the busiest city in america to fill one small book","symbols":""},{"label":-1,"rating":2.0,"title":"hard to get

couples making out and a drug-related mystery the library where i work cataloged this book as a juvenile graphic novel so i raised the alert and we're going to get it in the proper section for that reason alone i'm glad that i read this but i didn't like anything about the book.nothing about this story gripped me and its \"modernization\" is lazy beyond description the author changed side characters races and sexual orientations and she dropped a few superfluous references to taylor swift but that was pretty much it even though nancy had a cell phone she didn't bother to use it and she acted selfishly throughout the entire book letting her friends run all over town and fear for her life because she couldn't bother to keep her phone with her or answer it when it range nothing about

is already absurd and not in a dystopia sci-fi way but in a sloppy bad-writing way examples really good dystopian fiction almost doubles as survival manuals see life as we knew it for an example in this post apocalypse world once a week a year-old girl walks two miles with an my to bring back all the water she can carry a loaded my weighs about 9 pounds a gallon of water weighs about 8 pounds the average person uses a gallon of water a day it seems unlikely that she could have carried enough water to last a week pounds 9 for the gun for two miles with a loaded m-.2. the survival items she packs for a long trek somewhere else in a world where there's no other people anywhere include tide and deodorant seriously so there's apparently working washing machines even without people and tide is the brand of choice you don't even take crap like that with you when you go camping let alone in an end of the world environment.3. the author describes cassie's greatest worry prior to this event being whether or not anyone thought she was pretty that's how you know this is written by a male author why is the protagonist female then i have no idea but it's not clear whether or not rick yancey

wrote a story about her life her loves her struggles and her triumphs she tackled every issue from teenage sex rape drugs racism the music industry to her struggle with infertility the format is appealing as a conversational prose like she was having a conversation with a friend while i thought her thoughts on race were interesting some of the things that i thought she really could have talked more about were glossed over granted i know that her rape at a rayless shoe store when she was a teen was difficult i expected her to mention more than she did she briefly mentioning the settlement i.e., money and towards the end mentioned meeting with women who were also victims i think i would have liked it more had she really discussed that versus some of the other stuff she rambled about so if you are asking yourself why only 2.5 to 3 stars it was because i did like \"some\" parts of her discussion regarding being a step parent and her attempts at balancing a family and

returned to the uk.eamonn is living in lomaverde, a remote half-finished ghost estate where a handful of other expats are struggling to put a brave face on a financial disaster many of the unoccupied houses are unfinished electric cables are exposed on unfinished roads and squatters have moved in while dermot expects a relaxing two week holiday he finds himself dealing with his son's depression and self destructive actions.the strongest parts of the novel are dermot's memories and the interactions between the expats who try to organize the estate and some social interactions unfortunately the character of eamonn is over-the-top. he's a walking disaster who careens from one faux pas to another but in spite of its flaws i enjoyed the book for its refreshing optimistic tone i'd say that

completely overwhelms and obscures any metaphysical truths that crop up much more sparsely than in the previous to be honest i bought the whole series on the recommendation of a friend and now i have definite reservations about continuing at the least i've had to shift to some different books to create a bit of a breather after an entire volume of constant clinches plus the author's tendency to
