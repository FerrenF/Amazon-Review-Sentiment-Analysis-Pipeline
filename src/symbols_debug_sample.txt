Great !,Fiancé loved it !,
A boat race between three captains an their boats!!,A great mystery of who done it and why!!  Books by Wendy Meadows are hard to put down! You want to know what happens next!!,
We Gotta Get Out of This Place,"This is a side of the Beatles that I didn't know much about -- the business side. After their first manager, Brian Epstein, died, they needed a new manager and how. Their finances were in a mess and none of them had any idea how to deal with money. At least the Rolling Stones had grown up in middle class families and Mick Jagger had even attended the London School of Economics for a year, so they were a tiny bit less unprepared for sudden wealth. Allen Klein, a New York accountant who had made a career representing American singers such as Sam Cooke and Bobby Vinton, was extremely ambitious and convinced the Stones that he'd get them more money, lots of it. He followed through, so the Beatles were interested. Paul McCartney was wary though, and with good reason. Klein was an operator and while he did get more money for his clients, he made sure he did all right too. Somehow he had ended up with the rights to all of Sam Cooke's songs and made questionable tax shelters for his clients.Author Fred Goodman goes into great detail about the angles Klein was playing and sometimes it gets a bit convoluted, but that's the way Klein liked it. Lots of celebrities and gossip here, but mostly business ins and outs and to be honest, I had to skim it in places just to get through. Nice look at a different take on The Beatles though, and no one comes out of it looking good.",
Great,It would be helpful if anything happens to my car.,
Could not put it down!,"This was a great read -- strong, real characters moving through the intrigue of our recent history.  Well researched and tightly written.  Don't miss it!",
Four Stars,"Great book, perfect summer reading for the avid reader.",
ramblings of an insipid,"First of all, isn't there something to be said for aesthetics when it comes to covers?  Well, then, the cover definitely has to be altered.  Maybe they could put a picture of a house plant on there or something to represent this guy's personality.Secondly, the book tries to take itself way too seriously.and C. Polite? Timid? Is this guy supposed to be funny. I thought  he was a serious art critic, then I start in and he's talking all this politix crapola.  Is this guy a comedian or not?  I thought he had a show on amazon.I once saw him do stand-up comedy and he was funny.  He talked about funny things.  But here, this ain't no pulitzer writing 'dat for for sure.Maybe he try again, but I afraid his publisher no like any more and he have to self-publish, mebbee.I'd rather read Dr. Seuss -- this fox ain't got no sox and his ham and egss is done greened on him.",
Adorable,My kids love this book!,
nice,Simple and convenient. I wanted more ballet sessions than workouts but i must have misread it! Great book though :),
A great book for add to your collection,"Highly recomended for those who wants do it manga, is very esencial, and if you are a fan from Hirohiko Araki and Jojos Bizarre Adventure, this book must be added in your collection",
Love Flavia - but I was disappointed,"I pre-order these books as soon as they are announced, and then gobble them up as soon as they are delivered.  This one, however, was a slog to get through.  Flavia and Dogger have their first 'case'.  All the characters are a delight, the scenes beautifully described, but the story from beginning to end stumbled along.",
Helps with Food Recognition,"My son LOVES these books.  This one is not my favorite of the collection, I actually prefer the vegetables.  But, this one does have the same effect... a few weeks after getting this book in our regular rotation, my son started actually eating the apples and pears we'd been offering him for months.  Go figure!",
Fabulous,"Fabulous read.  Could not put it down.I do understand that doors are more easily opened to certain people, but do not understand the concept that you need to be Hispanic/latinx  in order to study/research issues related to that ethnicity and write prose regarding them.  When has study, research  and creative license been limited to only the ethnic group who experiences these struggles?Many people write detective fiction when they themselves have never been employed as a detective...  or “stories” regarding the catholic faith when they themselves are not Catholic.... or WW II stories when they were  born well after D Day, etc.The injustice that surrounds which authors and “stories” are picked up by publishers should not be laid at the foot of Ms Cummins.  She has written an un- put- downable story, although heartbreaking, and she should be commended for her talents.",
Her Restless Heart - Mary Katherine's Decision!,"Mary Katherine was fed up living at home with her controlling Father; besides being controlling her Father was never satisfied with anything Mary Katherine did.  There wasn't any way of pleasing her unbearable Father.  When she couldn't stand it at home any longer she moved in with her Grandmother Leah and works in her Grandmother's shop called Stitches in Time.  Mary Katherine loves her life working in her Grandmother's shop.  She also loves to weave and enjoys coming up with her own designs using textures of cotton, wool, and silk.Mary Katherine's cousins Naomi and Anna works in her Grandmother's shop too.  It seems like one happy family.  She feels the love from her Grandmother and cousins that she doesn't feel at home.Jacob has been a friend of Mary Katherine's for a long time.  Jacob wants more than friendship and hopes to court her.  Mary Katherine has told Jacob she isn't interested in being anything but friends.Daniel, a long time school friend of Mary Katherine's and Jacob's, has come back to Paradise to sell the family farm.  Daniel's family decided to move to Pinecraft, Florida several years ago.  Daniel too shows an interest in Mary Katherine and urges her to come visit him in Florida.To the dismay of her parents and grandmother Mary Katherine hasn't joined the church yet.  Her heart is restless and she doesn't know where she belongs.  Does she have enough faith in God to trust Him?Will Mary Katherine leave her Amish upbringing and move toward the English world?  Will she go visit Daniel and his family in Florida and end up staying there?  Will she fall in love with Jacob and join the church?  What will Mary Katherine do to calm her restless heart?The author takes us through the private life of Mary Katherine and her parents.  She shows us a side to Amish families that other Amish fiction authors might not.  We are taken into the real life of what happens and does happen in some relationships.  I really liked that about this book.  We can compare it to our way of living also.  Are we really so much different?This was another great read of Barbara Cameron's and I loved it from beginning to end.  I can't wait for book 2, Journey of the Heart, to be released.  This will be Naomi's story.  I get the feeling there's a lot going on in Naomi's life!",
Great read.,I love time period. Well written. Would definitely recommended all Philippa Gregory books to anyone who has  the same interests.,
Five Stars,It was perfect!,
Fantastic read!,"Absolutely a great read! Couldn't put it down, I had no idea there was this side to yoga.",
Ben Miller comedian/ physicist,A fun read by a funny man.,
Even better than Ghost Signs 1,"Great follow up to the first volume. More background information. Thorough, heartwarming look at New York's past, both distant and not so far away. Images are well done and make you want to run out using the book as a guide to view these priceless gems yourself.",
An Indispensable History of Anime,"In this book, Ladd offers a vital perspective: one that comes directly from the creative pioneer who brought anime to the Americas -- not just to the U.S., as some anime web sites mistakenly claim. It's a relief to have found a book which provides a wholly accurate, engaging, and detailed history of anime. I grew up watching Gigantor, Kimba, Astro Boy, and the other anime series Ladd was responsible for bringing to us. This book offers a much-welcome and informative way to feel connected again to those programs, and that period.",
An adorable story about two friends.,"&#34;Kitten & Butterfly&#34; written by Aviva Gittle and illustrated by Tekla Huszár is an adorable book that I enjoyed a lot. Even though Kitten and Butterfly have many differences, they still become very good friends.The illustrations are so charming. I especially liked the way Author Aviva Gittle added extended fun with coloring pages at the end of the story.(I received a copy of this story through a free promotion held by the author.)",
children's books,For some reason which I personally can't fathom children LOVE these books. My 10 yr. is required to read 20 mins. per night for school. At least with this book I don't have to fight with him to do it. He WANTS to read this series.,
Action,Packed full of action,
Nice Value Priced Book,"Nice book for the price, double sided so that limits me to only coloring with pencils but I am okay with that",
Five Stars,Very good book,
Great questions,"I like the questions but i didnt like how there are no lines for where you write its like copy paper, and i have OCD so i just answer them somewhere else",
Love this!,"I never even knew this existed until it randomly popped up one day. I am very much into anime and manga, so I jumped at the chance to read a compilation of stories from artists I'd never read before, created from all around the globe. Gorgeous art, great stories, and a fantastic add to my collection. I will absolutely be purchasing other volumes of Saturday AM.",
The Accidental Bestseller,"This was my first book I have ready by Wendy Wax and honestly the only story that appealed to me, but I liked this story about 4 friends who met 10 years prior to where the story starts off.  It isn't something to be taken too seriously, but it was a fun read.",
Excellent!!!,"I found this book to have a very readable and concise history of the environment and the development of the two big cities of Arizona. A good mix of sociology, history, geography, and politics and overall big picture of how they all played a role in the development of Arizona's growth. Great resource for college term papers, or graduate level research, and also good for the layperson who is interested in this subject matter.",
Whats up with the page numbers,"The page numbers in the book are off, compared to other peoples books.",
Proceed with caution,"This book is highly addictive and once you crack it open and begin to read...nothing else will matter.  I mean nothing.  Dishes? What dishes?  Feeding the family? Nah, they can have sammiches.Seriously though,  this book is amazingly written.  So many twists and turns up to the very end.  Bravo Alice Feeney!You need this book.  Read it, read it now!!!",
A Great Read,George Toma has inspired so many people with his great work ethic and dedication. This book does a fine job of detailing the life of a great man.,
Dark read,"This is a morose, but seemingly true tale of life in the 1960's. I don't imagine things are much different now. Our protagonist, although he has a degree from Harvard, has fallen on hard times. Maybe through his own error. Does it matter? There is a random element to life. His family does not even own a car. There is nothing romantic about poverty.Our protagonist begins to contemplate what he is willing to do to improve his circumstances. The early 60's were a time of relative prosperity, and he has somehow fallen behind. He sees others engaging in bad behaviors with relative impunity.At some point the book becomes meandering and quite difficult to follow. I would not describe it as a pleasant read. Everybody in town has some kind of sordid secret which comes to light. I imagine that is the point.I read it twice, maybe 10 years apart, and both times felt like I had missed something.Life is full of dark things. If it hasn't happened yet to you, your turn is coming.",
This Author Has So Much To Offer,"It's hard not to fall into the alternate universes that Mike Chinakos has dreamt this time around.  Make way and make time for these stories.  While I have read his two previous novels of Hollywood Cowboys and Kiss of the Traitor, his writing style demanded my attention to explore this short story compilation.  This series of shorts follows a universe set in motion by a character named John Wayfinder who puts the reader in the near and far futures of humanity following an alien event.  Nearly all of the stories overlap in some branched way and somehow are all connected into exploring a unique idea of becoming ""unstuck"" in the universe; a premise that a single person can move forward and backward through time along a created universe, to recruit an unlikely team to rid the timeline of his own mistake.  A genuinely fun and light-hearted sci-fi read, there are moments where action takes over logic and launches us readers into a void where we question motive over moral.  A solid read throughout.  I highly recommend this collection, and, if you have not read his other works, you should add them to your reading list as well.",
Good Pro Tips If You're A Beginner,"I found 12 recipes I wanted to try and actually got to make two of them. Farro Salad and Chicken Marbella. It was my first time eating farro and now I love it because of Ina! The Chicken Marbella seemed to be too oily. Other than that, it was a good chicken dish and wasn't complicated at all. I look forward to trying her other recipes in her cookbook. Thank you Clarkson Potter for the free book!",
Great purchase,When I bought it I was expecting a pretty deck but it surpassed all of my expectations. It comes in a hard box with a greatly written guide book. The cards are made out of great card stock and are just gorgeous!,
Not as advertized,The title is shown is not in English but English is listed as the language.  It is not.  I bought books for my grandchildren and now I need to reorder.  I am not disappointed in the book but in Amazon's inability to get the facts correct.,
Great book,"Simple, but to the point. Got it for my 8 yr to give for my husband for Father's Day, age group should be 6 yr old below.  It's cute but for pre schooler.",
Five Stars,good book,
must have,"I have Martha Stewart's first cookie book and I was hesitant to order yet another, fearing it would contain repeats of the first book. It does not.  For serious cookie bakers, I think you need to add this one to your collection.  It does have advanced techniques in it and cookie bakers can always use more ideas for new cookies. I had fun with this during the holidays!",
Great Book,"A  great book--- well researched,  excellent history and sociology, combined with a novelist's skillful characterizations of real people that the reader comes to care about.",
Good book,"My daughter's favorite book, should have bought two, as this one up will be worn out. The pictures seem like they r of outdated items, but it gets the words across...",
A must have for Braves fans,"This book is a must for any Braves fan. Photographers and WWII enthusiasts may want to check it out as well. I was fortunate enough to interview Walter Victor (the subject of this book) recently for a newspaper article I was writing and he is without a doubt the kindest man you'll ever meet. He went through the book with me and described the significance of many of the pictures, some of which are included in exhibitions at the Baseball Hall of Fame.This book doesn't just chronicle Victor's experience as the official photographer for the Atlanta Braves baseball team though, there are also early photos that Walter took while fighting in Europe during WWII.In closing, I further want to stress that this is an important book to own if you are a fan of America's baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, or a fan of America in general, Victor one of the last of a dwindling breed of Americans who possess true grit, guts and spirit.",
Fantastic feel-good read! ❤️,"This book was a fantastic feel-good read.I went into it dreading getting lost in a combined storyline of the three siblings, but found the chapters flowed very smoothly between the characters and in no time I was hooked.Beautiful character buildup and a great premise.And…..I want to be Nora when I grow up ❤️Highly recommended!!",❤️❤️
Five Stars,Good read,
"Faith, Love, Forgiveness, Awareness","Wow!! What a great read. &#34;Her Brother's Keeper&#34; is the perfect mix of faith, love, and forgiveness while bringing awareness to depression, suicide, and mental health as a whole. The only aspect I disliked was the the book ended! I am already eager to read what Beth produces next!",
Attention keeping suspensful mystery book infused with passion!,"I enjoyed the Di Luca family and it's suspenseful drama set in fictitious Bella Terra which I suspect is the Napa Valley. I read this book in two days because it was addicting and I wanted to see how Eli and Chloe's relationship would pan out. These two had some hot chemistry between them and that helped the overall story. Christina Dodd never disappoints, she's an excellent writer, and her plots are always interesting. I'm looking forward to reading part three of this series.",
EVERYONE needs this cookbook!,"There is a little bit of EVERYTHING in this cookbook from everyday cooking, to special dinner recipes, to bread, to cheese, to gardening to keeping chickens and goats.  It is like the Mary Poppins bag!  You keep looking at it and wondering how in the world Jill packed that much information into one book---and yet there it is---along with ALL the recipes that you say I WISH---like ""I WISH someone could tell me how to make biscuits light and fluffy.'"" ""I WISH I had a grandma to show me how to make good homemade bread.""  If you don't homestead, you will love this book for answering all your cooking questions.  If you DO homestead you will love this book for a TON of practical wisdom. If you don't cook, you will still love this book for its stories.  It is a beautiful cookbook filled with beautiful pictures and I can't stop looking at it!",
Worth the read,I bought the book on a whim and It was really good.  The book is worth the couple of dollars.,
I am using this to study for Step 1 along ...,"I am using this to study for Step 1 along with First Aid (basically UFAP + SketchyMedical), it has been very helpful. A lot of my classmates swear by it.",+
Very NIce!,Nephew loved this!! Went head over heels when he opened it!,
"A Powerful, Candid, Fast-Paced Thriller. A Must Read.","Wow-wow-wow. Angeline Boulley's Firekeeper's Daughter is a fantastic debut.But if you only talk about it as a YA thriller, you’re missing half the book. That’s just the plot. Yes,  Daunis is an 18-year old biracial Anishinaabe woman gets who pulled into an FBI investigation into the drug trade in her community and falls for the new guy on her brother’s hockey team. She’s a solid hockey player in her own right and a science nerd.But within that story, Angeline Boulley's debut paints a vivid picture of what it is to be a biracial Native American woman. With Daunis, we get a clear sense of how her Anishinaabe culture, traditions, and community ground her daily life; how she balances and code switches between her white and Nish families; and how she's torn between heading to college, but knowing she has a responsibility to her family and community. As a biracial person, it’s incredibly relatable.A fast-paced thriller and a thoughtful coming of age story, Firekeeper's Daughter is a love letter to Anishinaabe traditions and the power of community. But in it, Boulley also lays bare the long-term impacts of colonization; racism and bigotry; politics within indigenous communities; the way the federal government’s actions have contributed to corruption and the meth epidemic, and relegated indigenous communities, especially their women, to second, even third-class citizen status.FIrekeeper's Daughter is powerful and candid with rich characters and a compelling case to unravel. I can't wait to see Daunis brought to life on Netflix.It’s YA, but it’s definitely for older teens.CW: Sexual assault, gun violence, murder, grief, drug traffickingI received an advance reader copy from the publisher and purchased my own from an indie bookstore.",
It’s amazing,I love this book it every different from the little mermaid we know but still I love it,
Five Stars,Perfect.,
Fun to build models in the book,"This book was fun. Not only did it show how to make amazing LEGO cars, it also showed me what transmissions and differential gears are. It showed me how I could use pieces I haven’t used before.",
Gruesome,"This book is very interesting, but be forewarned: it’s also frightening & gruesome. It makes a person aware that you can’t trust anyone, & you need to be aware of your surroundings at all times!",
Disappointing and Frustrating,"Navy SEAL, Scott Leighton, first met Naval Doctor, Alexis Rogets, two years ago and hasn't been able to get her out of his mind since. They occasionally cross paths, but she always avoids him. Determined, Scott sets out to make Alexis his, once and for all.I really wanted to like this book. I enjoyed the first book in the Megalodon Team series and hoped this one would be as good if not better. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. I found Alexis to be frustrating, childish and annoying. The one bright spot in the book was Scott. He was so loving, passionate, protective and all around great. With all of those wonderful attributes, Alexis just refused to believe that Scott loved her, wanted to be with her AND was only interested in her. It was okay for her to hear bits and pieces of conversations and jump to conclusions, but the one moment he did, it was a catastrophic event with her storming away and leaving him to berate himself.So often throughout this book, I hoped Scott would just stop pursuing Alexis and find a woman who wasn't so fickle and flighty; one who could actually return his feelings without a bunch of games and back and forth struggle. I understood that their jobs within the Navy and their rankings were an issue, but Alexis took it to the extreme. I wanted to scream when she would continue to address Scott as 'Commander' even though he practically begged her to call him by his first name. I took that as a way for her to not only put up a wall, but also as an unnecessary show of power over him to let him know that she wasn't going to succumb to his affections.I will try to read the next book in the series. Hopefully it will be better, but I already sense a pattern with these books - SEAL falls madly in love with woman, woman rebuffs his advances, man refuses to stop, woman gives in and develops feelings, woman hears tail end of a conversation and thinks man is in love with another woman, and man has to regain her trust and love. We'll see.",
Great reading if nothing else,"I enjoy good writing.  I enjoy perfumes.  This books meets both needs.  While I do not always agree with the reviews, they are full of wit and grace, and are thus eminently enjoyable.  I have had to scramble for the dictionary a couple of times, but that was a challenge I rather enjoyed, not having had experienced it in a while.  I read it straight through.",
Great Item!!,Great quality!!,
A Fascinating Look behind the Scenes of Hawaii Real Estate,"To me, as a part-time real estate investor living in Hawaii, this was a very interesting read.  In fact, to me it was a 4-star, but even for general public, the topics, presentation, and life experiences described are worth at least 3-stars.  Stephany describes her entry into the male-dominated business world and the problems she encountered in proving her worth with each new step up the ladder and ultimately earning the respect of many prominent community leaders, not just limited to those in her own profession.If one is familiar with Hawaii, her story is doubly interesting as she recounts her experiences with well known real estate moguls, and other business and community leaders.  It is an easy read, entertaining, and provides fascinating insight into the world of real estate here in Hawaii over the past several decades.",
He was a wonderful man and will be greatly missed by the Montana ...,I met Mr. Steele. He was a wonderful man and will be greatly missed by the Montana community!,
Would be good story - if not so poorly written.,"I bought this book in 2014, it was in my 'to read' pile, I just got around to reading it now.  The base of the story is interesting but it is a very poorly written book.  It's difficult to stay in tune with the story when you constantly have to re-read as if doing a double take &#34;is this really written like this?&#34;.  Very chopping language and I'm not referring to slang or regional accents.",
Must Reading For Gun Owners!,The banditry after Hurricane Katrina is well known as is the incompetance of most of the local officials. This book details several first person accounts of illegal gun confiscations from ordinary citizens who were trying to protect themselves from the thugs. I would encourage any lawful gun owner to read this book.,
Painful AND helpful...,"Heartrending and hit painfully close to home, but was SO helpful to get a completely honest look at what the errant spouse was thinking that led to their actions.....",
Five Stars,Great book for math teachers!,
"Spying, Surfing, Shagging","No doubt there are a lot of things they don't tell you when you sign on for a hitch at The Agency.Gus discovers when he is detailed to the embassy in Indonesia that the other station hands are only interested in golf and diplomatic parties. Fortunately our hero has packed his surf boards, and arrives just when the country is being opened up as a surfing paradise. Along the way he also finds exotic women and interesting bars, forms an entourage of locals and international expatriates, and even commits a little espionage.The book is kind of an inverse of Graham Greene's ""Our Man in Havana""; instead of making stuff up for his handlers, Gus tries to avoid telling his boss about the contact he has made with an Iraqi diplomat on the cusp of the first Gulf War. While chuckling at Gus's bureaucratic entanglements with his superiors, the reader gets a travelogue of Indonesian beaches and colorful details of Jakarta nightlife.",
Amazing,My daughter LOVES this!!,
Very easy to follow and very tasty,"So happy with this cookbook.  There are lots of really yummy dishes.  I have made 5 so far, and each has been a success.  I can make most of these dishes quickly, which has been fantastic for those weekday meals.  I have also found that there are plenty of options for more special occasions.  The other element I like about these recipes is that I am really satiated and more than satisfied after a meal, they do not leave me feeling in anyway as if I have had a &#34;heart healthy&#34; meal and pinning for a splurge day.",
Not good!!,"Didn't like it, could not get into it. I didn't even finish it. I usually like this kind of book, but not this one. I would not recommend this book to anyone.",
Awesome book,"One of the best books I have ever read. Such wonderful pointers on raising children. Wish I knew those thjings, when my kids were small. What a wise wonderful mother Marie had. The Osmond kids, were very blessed. I would highly recommend this book to everybody who has children to raise.",
"good, but disappointing","Agree with a couple of the other posters.  This is a great idea/theme, and the pop-ups are, as usual, very intricate, but the lack of color is very disappointing.  This doesn't compare to his other books.",
Steel Structures Design by Alan Williams,"[[ASIN:0071638377 Steel Structures Design: ASD/LRFD]] I found this book to be a complele guide to the design of steel structures .It also  introduces the theoretical background and fundamental basis of steel design and covers the detailed design of members and their connections. This in-depth resource provides clear interpretations of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC).The book clearly is an excelent guide to Specification for Structural Steel Buildings Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures . The code requirements are illustrated with about 200  design examples and step-by-step solutions.  Coverage includes:Steel buildings and design criteria,Design loads,Behavior of steel structures under design loads,Design of steel structures under design loads,steel beams in flexure, steel beams for shear and torsion, compression members,Stability of frames,Design by inelastic analysis, of tension members, of bolted and welded connections,Plate girders and Composite construction.",
Summary of a Great Actress History,"I really enjoyed this book as Beverly's childhood home in Hollywood was close to where I grew up. Some of the actors and places she referred to were familiar to me. I thought her writing style was excellent and she showed how she loved passionately her fellow actors and friends. Also,I loved all of the pictures of her with famose actors,especially Jack Benny. Yes, I would definitely recommend this book to everyone I know!",
A perfect source for understanding social development,"I've read ""about"" spiral dynamics for years and read other works with similar models, but this is by far the best source I've seen yet. I find it useful not only in helping me with the teens that I teach, but also at work in understanding the various mindsets that I encounter - especially in this day of near constant change in the workplace. In the classroom, it helped me to think of types of experiential learning exercises for the teens to help them learn how to deal with their emotions, drives, and impulses. A mix of competative ""Red"" and ""Orange"" activities to get the idea that competition has a destructive side, followed by more ""Green"" cooperative activities to show how it solves so many problems. With so many of the teens now concerned about the environment and war, activities that highlight the Orange/GREEN transition has been key to their classroom experience. It has also helped at work in understanding why certain types of project management schemes (such as the popular SCRUM method) failed to work in our Blue/ORANGE company environment.",
All 60 Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle in just 2 volumes? Can it be true?,"Let me guess, you want to get into Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes works - but you do not know where to start?You recognize ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" the most but realize it was written after a number of Holmes stories.... You do not want to start at the beginning because there are other more well-known Holmes stories you would like to get acquainted with first.... You have heard about the large number of Sherlock Holmes short stories and do not know which one to start with....Elementary, my dear reader - there is a simple solution to your dilemma: The Complete Sherlock Holmes: All 4 Novels and 56 Short Stories.You honestly cannot find a better deal than this: all 4 novels and 56 short stories featuring Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in 2 chronological volumes for around $10.00. It is unbelievable - astounding, even!Arthur Conan Doyle is one of my favorite authors - and his Sherlock Holmes character (although Doyle himself would bore of the character and long for an end to writing about him) is one of my personal favorite characters of literature. Doyle's stories are suspenseful, funny, all-out entertaining and, of course, phenomenally written - the character of Sherlock Holmes is one of the most complex and fun to follow protagonists in the history of known literature.Unless you are a collector, there is no reason to try to assemble the works of Arthur Conan Doyle individually, piece by piece, when The Complete Sherlock Holmes offers you every story in two volumes for such a low price.",$
Great Book! 6th Sense+The Skulls+The Tale of the Body Thief!,"Will Clarke is such a great author, he reminds me of Anne Rice because you are sucked in and have no idea what is going on around you while you read. This book is so interesting because it is told from the viewpoint of a ghost, but instead of the typical nice naive person who is randomly murdered ghost (Lovely Bones, Dead like me) this is your stereotypical fraternity boy. The frat boy perspective gives it a fresh viewpoint and makes it really relatable because this guy is so normal and not perfect and not all harmonious & pious after death. Like Lord Vishnu, you have no idea where this book is going to go and you can't put the book down. I also liked learning about the inner workings of fraternity rituals which I've always wondered about, hence The Skulls reference above.  You can't go wrong with a Will Clarke book and here you have ghost stories, plus the college experience, plus great flushed out characters.  If you love interesting books that will make you think, this is for you!",++
Love this series!,Very enjoyable! Perfect beach reads.,
Interesting and Informative,"This book is so wonderful!  The first section tells you about the poses themselves with pictures to go along. It also gives you the options for the modified positions, which is helpful.  After that, you will find images of those same positions, however these images show the musculoskeletal system. It shows you exactly which muscles you are supposed to be working while completing these poses. That part was awesome, there are poses that I can do very well, but that's sometimes because I don't know what I'm actually supposed to focus on, for example, I may be using back strength instead of core strength.  Once I went over this section of the book it changed my practice completely.  I would recommend this completely!",
Meh!,"I have always been a fan of Ms Burke but this is probably my last read. I thought the story itself was weak and the characters unlikeable. As others have noted, I too am weary of the woke topics being touched upon regularly through the book, more even than in her last book. It isn’t that I disagree at all, but I come here to escape and immerse myself in a story, I do not need to be nagged to be a decent person.  I read the Clinton/Penney book prior to this and found a similar thing. It’s become tedious that the authors seem to think we readers don’t stay up to date on current topics so they need to push their agenda on us ignorant people.",
Funniest book ever!,We love this book!  Found it in Target and couldn't stop laughing!  Totally getting this for my dad for Christmas! He used to be a taxidermist.  The bear.... hysterical... totally our favorite!!!!,
Excellent mind challenging book,"I really liked this book, it challenges many of the physics theories that we learned but never really understood how or why. By challenging those theories the writer makes us re-think certain theories and not take them at face value. The book is easy to read yet it does address physics from a mathematical perspective.",
A Feast for the Eyes,"I haven't yet read the text, but I would very much like to comment on the reproductions of Bruegel paintings and drawings in the book: they are as numerous as they are excellent, page after page of complete paintings as well as close-up details. Very-very impressive. I would also highly recommend Larry Silver's ""Hieronymus Bosch"" published by Abbeville. Both are outstanding art books.",

The Title Says It All...,"Ok, well, not really.  Still though, it's a graphic novel about a time-hopping art thief and the girl he falls in love with.  Plus this hardcover version is signed by the author, Jeff Smith.  (He did the graphic novel &#34;Bone&#34; also.)  What more could you ask for.",

Excellent God-centered experience!,"My church used this a few years ago. I would love to do it agsin. It was a time for thinking, praying, worshipping - very well thought out product that any Christ- centered church would benefit from by giving their members this experience. I really enjoyed the freedom of this Labrynth, to go from spot to spot, thinking about the questions or statements offered. After going through this labryinth and spending time in prayer, I enjoyed the experience so much, I created a small room in my house just for prayer and time with God, and called it Sanctuary.",

Heroic,"I know that it would not be in Joni's intent to gain personal glory and accolades from the writing of this book. But I cannot help but be moved and challenged by the faith that she professes in a loving God that allows her to suffer.  I get it. I feel it...and boy am I rebuked to realize that her perspective on God is 100x greater than mine.I am grateful to God that Joni had the strength finish this book. I'm grateful to God that he would use the broken to teach the proud.  There is a reality to her faith that is refreshing and humbling.  At the end of the day she is just another forgiven person like the rest of us, but her lifetime of God experiences definitely sets her apart as someone I should be listening to and learning from.Her struggling and wrestling with her suffering is heroic because I know her testimony may potentially save lives by creating hope and forgiveness for those who are in pain (physical, emotional, etc.).",
Beautiful Story,"I had read another book by Weiland, and was disappointed by it. I was not really interested in paying for anything else by her. However, after receiving a free review copy of 'The Memory Lights', I think my faith in her is restored. I have a feeling that I might like some of her other books.Memory Lights is written with vibrancy and skill. The characters are awesome, and I felt like I was there, and everything happening was real. Though it's such a short story, I found it easy to keep up with each revelation, and the end result was touching and beautiful.",

A Great Start to A New Series!,"I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.This first book “Under Pressure” in Lori Foster’s new Body Armor series is great start to what I hope is a fantastic new series. I’ve been waiting to see Leese redeem himself since we first met him. Our first glimpse at Leese was not a very good one back then but he has certainly redeemed himself and won me over for sure! We are introduced to Catalina in this book and she’s a feisty woman that wants to stand on her own and has every reason to not want to get close to anyone because she doesn’t want them to get hurt by people she once trusted.Leese and Catalina have to work together in order to bring down powerful men that have hurt a lot of innocent people. Leese is able to work with his new boss, Sahara, owner of Body Armor Security Agency to figure out how to catch the bad guys and keep Catalina safe before it’s too late. All the while, Leese and Cat slowly fall for one another and find out what it is to truly realize what it means to sacrifice and love someone else.I am really excited about this new series (as I am for pretty much all Lori’s books/series). I love visiting characters from previous books. Next up is Justice and I’m really looking forward to his HEA.",

I like seeing Yelena without all her powers, it evens the playing field a bit.I hate all the secrets, especially between Valek and the Commander.

Who wouldn't want to work in a company with a Culture of Good?,"I was able to get an advance copy of this book and it's really something special. I've been working professionally for about 40 years, starting with your basic X style management structure at a large company. I've seen management ideas come and go, I've given a weekly portion of my income to the big company philanthropy in the sky, and I've consulted in many companies and industries. What I have not seen throughout all of that is anything like the culture these two guys have built. I was so taken by the ideas and the stories in this book that I had to check it out myself. I talked with several employees, young people working retail, to see if it could be real. To a person, they love working at TCC. It's literally changed their lives to the point that they care more about their fellow employees. They enjoy their customers and they want to help their communities. I can see how this would improve business results as well, but best of all, they're able to do great things to improve the world we all live in. Read this book and if you own or lead a company, build your own culture of good!",

6 Words - Why Did I Take So Long ?,"I decided that this year I was going to go through my Kindle e-books and read ones that I have had sitting on there for years. I scrolled through and came to Heartless by J. Sterling. I knew this was going to be a quick read as it's part of a three episode serial.  This book started with Elizabeth Lyons finding her boyfriend cheating on her with her roommate at the time. Of course, the guy Ben was a jerk and made it like it was Elizabeth's fault as she was ambitious and heartless, and no guy liked that.  Fast forward eight years and Elizabeth is still a hardworking female, and she has made a name for herself in the production business which for females is hard including a young one like herself. She is awarded the honor of being one of the Thirty under thirty to look out for and heads to a party where she meets Daniel Alexander. He wants her, and she doesn't want the hassle of a relationship. Can Daniel find his romance bone to woo Elizabeth as she's not like the ones he has had before and will drop her panties on the first date?  I liked the start of this serial and found myself really getting into the story and was sad when it ended but happy since I had the next two on my Kindle already to move onto.  One of the best romance serials I have ever read. Definitely worth the read.",

You May Want to Take a Pass on This One,I selected this book based on the rating (4 stars) and the price.

It did not. &#34;Moving Day&#34; was a slow mover.,

Thank you Mark!!!,
FIRR-Kids! Review,"There is an attractive quality to pop up books, and this one hits the mark.  A succession of brightly colored animals leap off the pages, mouths flapping open and shut.  Each animal declares ""I'm going to eat you for my dinner!"" to the animal featured on the previous page.  And he does.Frog Vulture Gorilla Tiger Crocodile SharkThe illustrations are large - each animal spans two pages, with similarly large fonts for the text.  The hinged mouths pop out to invite little fingers to probe inside.  The combination of a simple layout, bold colors and repeating text make this book ideal for young children.A note of interest: this book is reasonably priced at $6.99, with several others available by the same author.",$
Great for inspectors with minimal experience,Takes an approach that develops knowledge and understanding for inspectors and engineers with minimal to medium experience. Need to give more emphasis on building construction (small and medium size buildings).,
Interesting,"Hans was leagues ahead of time and his colleagues with his research. However, this book is sorely behind the times.For a much more up-to-date book covering the immune system and stress read Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, which is far more fun to read, too.",

It’s really easy to read and easy to follow with the book and CD combined! There isn’t really much to say about it and nothing negative to say. I really enjoy and it’s very thorough!",
interesting but very flawed,"Despite the fascinating interviews with vengeful and forgiving victims and with remarkable authorities, I almost dropped this halfway through, because Blumenfeld's drama-queen personality and self-indulgent writing style were getting hard to take; ultimately the book did not ring true for me. I stuck with it partly hoping to see the author (and her mother) get their come-uppance (hmmm...reader's revenge?). I felt truly sorry for her father (diminished more by her portrayal than by the shooter's action), and for her new husband, who kept a record indicating one out of four days in their new marriage was 'insufferable and intolerable.' (Her actions even made me feel sorry for Netanyahu!)Yet Laura plowed on -- oblivious to anyone else's needs or discomfort, deceiving and constantly manipulating people, cooly describing and then rationalizing her behavior, and scrutinizing her own tiresome emotional navel. Self-display is not the same thing as honesty or insight.Many reviewers are entranced by her writing -- and she has a really fine eye for telling detail, and at times turns a remarkable, poetic phrase -- but too often I found her writing felt forced, overwrought, or repetitive.Not really a book I can recommend.",

The author put a lot of work/thought into the book, a lot of small projects are included, which was a nice surprise.  But, and it's a BIG one, the ruler used in the book is not to be found on the ruler makers website.  Would have been nice to know the ruler was needed and that it was available.  Had I known the ruler was not available, I would have not bought the book.  That is the reason for the one star review.",

The Seventh...,What a powerful concept for a book. My daughter loved it and read it in less than a day. The Seventh Most Important thing is a book about a young boy and how he deals with the grief of loosing his father. It was engaging and heartfelt and is definitely recommended.,
Terrific cookbook,"I am picky about cookbooks. Although I love reading them, a cookbook has to be not only beautiful, interesting and unique, it has to be useful for real people, real home cooks (like me) in real kitchens, feeding real families and friends. On all accounts, this beautiful book from accomplished chef and food writer Rozanne Gold is a winner.First things first, the book itself--and this is so important for a cookbook--is easy to read and use. The binding is high quality and the typeface and layout are easy and comfortable to read, and there are beautiful photos for almost every recipe. The book will lie open flat so you can cook from it without fumbling.The recipes are wonderful--innovative without that tedious ""I'm trying too hard here to come up with something new and different!"" feeling in so many newer cookbooks. The recipes are geared toward quick preparation (15 minutes, 30 minutes) using fresh and simple whole foods, and even a few simple convenience foods, like canned beans and chickpeas, frozen peas and Dijon mustard. Fabulous.I cannot wait to try: ""Almost Confit"" Chicken with Melted Garlic, Pork Chops and Apples with Madeira-Bay Butter Sauce, A New Way to Cook Broccoli: Charred & Tossed With Chilies and Garlic, Spiced Salmon on a Moroccan Salad...oh, heck, I think I may just start at ""Bloody"" Shrimp Cocktail and work my through to Double Raspberry Sorbet.Recommendation: Excellent addition to a home cook's bookshelf.",
Great visit back to 90's culture.,"I enjoy this book more every day. I viewed the feature film first and enjoyed the characters so much I wanted more time with them. When the book is over, I will likely view the film again just to watch Sigourney Weaver as the boss and Margaret Qualley as our protagonist. Both actresses were endearing and loveable in their roles. And the wardrobe from the era is worth another visit!",
Thought provoking.,"This one put me through the wringer a bit. It's definitely not a feel good novel, though it does have its heartwarming moments. Most of it is bleak and raw. I'm happy to discover what I think is a very talented author and look forward to reading more of her work.Many years ago, Susan's little brother died while in her care. The guilt from his death continues to rule her life even when she has her own little boy to mother. Shockingly, the tragedy happened when she was only seven and her little brother almost five. A seven year old shouldn't even be left alone to care for themselves, let alone for another. Who is to blame, the child who took mothers pills? The slightly older sister watching him? Or the parents, the father who was working and left them in the care of the unstable mother who left her children alone to go out with another man? Little Mark was the clear favorite child of them both and with him gone, Susan suffers even more than she had before.  When she's grown and has a child of her own, she fears she'll hurt him and is too anxious to mother him in most any way. If she can't face her demons, she'll lose everything.I love books that just seem to flow. You don't want to put them down even if you're uncomfortable, you don't get confused by the characters or distracted from the story. This book flows and I read it all at once. Joan Ellis is one to watch for! I came away from it not only thinking about guilt and maternal instincts, but how small decisions we make every day can alter so much.I received a copy of this book from the author and Booklover Catlady Publicity in exchange for an honest review, thank you!",
I love the classics,"Poe is one of my all time favorites and now he goes where I go. I am adding more of these great writers to my Kindle. This collection is a great one and the price is good too. You won't regret ordering this one, I know I don't.",

Great Children's Book,Wonderful children's book!  Fantastic illustrations!  My grandchildren loved it.,
Pretty kickass.,"Violent is really not the right word for this spare-no-detail fantasy monstrosity. Insane? Maybe. Really, the only way to describe Remic's Kell's Legend is with a phrase: a bloody, violent, fantastic journey through carnage, terror, and a downright epic tale that makes Underworld and every zombie movie look bad. That sounds about right.Kell's Legend is the first is Remic's Clockwork Vampire Chronicles. It follows Kell, a legendary warrior who has grown old, and a number of other characters, from his granddaughter Nienna to Anukis, a clockwork vampire-turned-exile in her own homeland. When strange, twisted albino soldiers descend upon the city of Jalder, Kell must take up his axe once again to defend his family. But with that action comes a flood of memories hinting at his dark past, at the Kell nobody remembers or everyone chooses to forget...Remic certainly managed a tour de force with Kell's Legend. I've never read anything quite so unapologetic about its violence, but also brilliant in its brute force. Kell's Legend is rough, for sure; at the same time, however, it's entertaining and powerful, taking all that is wonderful about truly epic, adventurous fantasy and twisting it like Quentin Tarantino twists the movies. Remic is the Tarantino of fantasy (and science fiction, I presume), and if that isn't a compliment, then I don't know what is.Kell's Legend isn't just about action and brilliantly detailed fights. It's packed full of amazing dialogue (and some clever witty banter to boot), and the characters are three-dimensional, something I think many fantasy writers of the more action-packed vein (including myself) have issue with. Remic has managed to put together a tale that pushes the boundaries while maintaining the necessary elements of a good fantasy novel (interesting characters, gripping conflicts, etc.).There were only two problems I had with Kell's Legend:1) Sometimes the action can be a bit much. For the most part it's entertaining and propels the plot, but sometimes it feels overbearing; there aren't a lot of breaks.2) The language is outside of my comfort zone in one scene (and only one, as far as I can recall). If his language had kept in that vein for more than one chapter, then I would have tossed the book at the wall, but, thankfully, that is not what happened. However, if you cannot stand foul language in any form, this is not the book for you.Both of these problems are personal preferences and not indicative of any significant fault of the novel or Remic. If you aren't bothered by these things, then this is definitely a book for you. If you're already a Remic fan, then you'll love Kell's Legend.I look forward to the second book in the series. I'd love to know what happens with the Clockwork Vampires, Kell, his granddaughter, and some of the other characters.",

Review of Songwriter Deluxe by Fan & Friend,"In the mid 90s Ricky Roberts tried to make a revival of his R&R career with his &#34;An Evening with the Composer &#34; tour. Too bad he didn't have this book to guide him through that sorrowful attempt at a comeback. This book explains all the facts behind the creative compositions of Rick's songwriting from Flying Burrito Brothers to solo to Firefall to him as song contributor to Linda Ronstadt, Stephen Stills, Chris Hillman, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Bad, etc. Without being a scandalous &#34;tell all&#34; Rick takes the fan on a remarkable sojourn through the 80s always building interest as he was moved by his Muse ( no pun intended David or Mary) to write the next earmark of our lives. I suppose since Rick never took music composition you'll have to forgive him for not including the notes and written score. It would have been a big aid to the younger fledgling Rock Stars of tomorrow who would do well to cover Mr. Roberts' ballads & lullabies.",

Great book.,"After the first several chapters, I was ready to shut this book and not read again because I greatly disliked the book within a book stuff. I felt that those extra things distracted the reader from the main plot of the story itself. I would have rather have Jack Browning's books be more talked about than the non-relevant writers (since he is one of the main characters).Diane is a character I can relate and I enjoyed reading about her and her relationship with Jack.Overall, pretty good book.",

A genius at work.  Don't miss this one.,"Though long books exhaust me, I just finished this book and absolutely loved it.  I could not put it down and read the entire thing in less than a week.  I was so happy that Greg Iles dedicated it to Stanley Nelson, editor of the Concordia Sentinel, who is a true hero when it comes to reporting on unsolved murder and missing persons cases from the 1960s in east central Louisiana.  Using real events as a basis for part of the story, Iles demonstrates sheer genius in his ability to capture the reader's attention and hold it throughout the book as though he is reporting on non-fictional occurrences, complete with real people (many of whom are known to the reader).  My one frustration was related to the introduction of so many names that I sometimes got lost as to who they were and had to flip backwards in the book to remind myself. I would love to see a list of characters at the beginning of the next book in this trilogy.  This has to be an award winning piece of fiction.  Can't wait for the next one!",
Learn why prayer is good for you,"This simple book (only around 50 pages long or so) is quite inspiring. In it, Mr. Bounds expounds upon not only the many different reasons why we should pray, but also that we are being called to pray. He reminds us of how essential prayer was to the fathers in the Old Testament and how much prayer centered in the lives of Jesus and his disciples. While this book is written for pastors and other preachers of the gospel, it's a good inspiration to anyone wanting to grow closer to God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. While I do not think anyone will literally ""study"" this book, I believe that reading it once or twice in our lifetimes would benefit us in more ways that we might imagine. Pray, pray, and then pray some more!",
Rail networks?,"The publisher's description mentions that this map features, among other things, ""rail networks.""  On Kauai?  Er, no.  Read the description above and see.  Makes one wonder how much we can trust the map itself if their ad copy is not even checked for accuracy and plausability.  My guess is that like so much of this modern day world, people rely on pre-written templates out of laziness.  One size does definitely not fit all.  Go with Canada's ITMB map instead.",
It's has a good amount of photos,"This book was a treasure trove of information. It has a good amount of photos, but is not a photo book. I was particularly impressed with the authors treatment of the shootings of civilians. We have all seen allied propaganda which accused Germany of killing innocent people during the march into Belgium. I was able to interview a few remaining German vets in the 70's and they stated the same facts the book deals with. Civilians, under the rules of war, are forbidden to attack military personnel, doing so subjects you to legal reprisals. The civil population was aroused by priests and politicians to attack German soldiers by sniping. This in turn, caused a German reaction that executed these provocateurs according to the rules of war. Any nation would have done the same, and did the same. As with most propaganda, it's based on fact that is twisted to suit the accuser.",

Entertaining,"The Book of TOAD is an entertaining story that opens the door to a backstage view to the world of psychiatry as an  industry and career choice. In a clever and original premise, the narrator, a psyciatric resident at UCLA Medical Center, inadvertently inspires a patient to invent a web application that turns out to be a popular, wiki-like source of religious wisdom, called TOAD.The book is populated with a dozen or so interesting characters, and kept my interest all the way through. The main thrust of the story, however, is not TOAD. The first half of the book reads like an autobiography, focusing mainly on the narrator's ambivalence about his own career. Only in the second half of the book does an actual plot develop, involving chicanery within the political and professional world of psychiatry. Structured more like a mystery yarn, the intrigue of the second half succeeded at drawing me in to the conclusion.Unfortunately the book missed some interesting possibilities in exploring the ""wisdom"" of TOAD and the narrator's relation to it. Despite being seen as the project's inspiration, the narrator remains aloof from it, surprised that anyone is taking it seriously. We're told that TOAD enjoys legions of users who genuinely benefit from the program. It might have been fun if the narrator learned something from it, or an equally interesting possibility, learned to disagree with its teachings and became a heretic to his own following.Still in all, a good read told with inventiveness and humor, and lots to chew on.",
Superb! Love it! Fantastic!,Order did not take too long to ship from Brasil. Book came extremely well packed in plastic and inside a padded envelope to add extra cushion and protection. Not a single defect due to shipping. This is abrand new book and exactly what I hoped for. Amazing and easy to follow music arrangements. This is a must have for any Roberto Carlos fan and collector. I am very happy with this purchase. I wanted this book for a long time and finally was able to get buy it. Highly recommend Livraria Seline in São Paulo for its awesome services!!!,
So cute!,"Did you know that the author of this book, Alecia Whitaker, is from Cynthiana, Kentucky? Did you also know that I live about an hour away from there? Crazy! I could just relate to this book so much. What Alecia Whitaker wrote was so relatable and so true for this area of the country.The story is about an all country farm girl Ricki Jo, but please call her Ericka if she is at school. She is fourteen years old, lives on her father's farm, and her best friend Luke Foster lives just right down the street. This coming of age novel talks about all the things a girl wants to happen once she enters High School. Ricki Jo wants to be popular and fit in with the cool crowd, but can she still be herself and not change to fit in with the popular crowd?I just loved this book so much! I could relate so much to Ricki Jo at parts in the book. My dad was also a Tabaco farmer, but quite once there was a big buy out which is just what Ricki Jo's dad did also. I live on a farm with cattle, crops, and barns. So I just got really into the story. Ricki Jo lived in a town that isn't too different from mine. The author uses a lot of references that I could understand.I also really enjoyed the characters. Ricki Jo is friends with a bunch of mean girls, but at the end you really see redeeming qualities in them all. My favorite character was Luke and he really held the book together at times. While there relationship was perdictable, I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen with them in the end. I am glad that Ricki Jo's friend Mackenzie turned out to be a true friend. I really liked her at the beginning and thought that she was nice to Ricki Jo when the other girls weren't.Ricki Jo is relatable to me because there have been a lot of times that I have been in the same position as her. I never really fit in at my high school and I remember putting up with mean comments, just to say that I have friends. But I never had as good as friend as Luke. Ricki Jo is lucky! I also loved all her funny commentary; there were parts when I was laughing out loud.I also just got to say I love Kentucky! It is so beautiful and I love how the author you a lot of descriptive language to describe their farm and how farm life was.Overall, The Queen of Kentucky has a very good message that I think everybody should take the time to read. I would recommend this to any girl that is in middle school. I really enjoyed it and glad that I had it down in my 2012 Debut Author Challenge. I really wish that the author would write another one. There is so much that could go on with these characters! I also just want to read more about Ricki Jo and Luke! Along with Mackenzie and Candace.",
Best book of the series hands down.,"LOVED IT!!!!! Loved every story, loved how how some intertwine in some of the most curve ball kind of ways, and loved how it makes you feel life and that dust ball or a planet. Fantastic.",

As a woman-- this book irritated me,"I am certainly a foodie and love books that take place in Asia, so this book seemed like it was made for me. Unfortunately, the plot was undeveloped, and the food descriptions were so distracting that it was hard to read; however, I kept going. I even began to cheer for the female protagonist as she struggled to find herself. Once I was finally compelled enough to finish the book, the ending slapped me in the face.*SPOILERS* The female protagonist, a career woman with a love for food, finds true love for her coworker, an arrogant misogynist. And on top of that-- he validates her existence so much that she magically becomes happy/content in herself and her life and she loses weight? Perhaps this is a ""happy ending"" that was lost in translation, but to me, this was highly offensive, and had the opposite effect, at least on me. The book could have finished without this very outdated conclusion, which seemed tacked on to the end.",
Perfect!,"This book is everything. I wish I had this as a child. The artwork and detail to the African American characters is outstanding.I bought this for my niece, and my mother daw it and ended up taking it to work to show it around, 4 more people bought it for their kids as well.My niece who is 5 loves it and wants me to read it to her all the time.Also, in case your wondering Goldilocks is called Goldilocks because of the Gold Beads in her hair. Genius use of Black Characters Traditional Fairy TalesI love this book, and children do too.",
Right There All the Time,"An exciting read by one of my favorite authors of Christian fiction! Whitlow actually makes law sound interesting without using a lot of lawyer jargon. With numerous roadblocks and several critical junctions, I liked the winding route he took getting to the conclusion of the story. The characters are so real and cover such a broad spectrum of personalities. For me, the best scene in the story took place on the evening when Buddy and Gracie joined Beatrice and the judge for dinner. I would have loved to have heard Gracie as she prayed before their dinner. Some books have a faint spiritual undercurrent with an over-abundance of romance, action, and suspense. I appreciated the manner in which Gracie was able to just be herself and let her inner beauty shine out to light up the world around her. Unlike many who try to force their beliefs on others, she had a way of living her beliefs in such a way that people gravitated to her and trusted her with their deepest concerns. In so doing, they often opened themselves to receive a special touch from above in such a natural and unrehearsed manner. The world could use a lot more people like her. A wonderful story!",
Five Stars,awesome,
super cute!,This book is perfect for the season & just about anyone who loves cats.,
"Masterful plotting, credible characters provide new view to a tumultuous time","Authentic, credible characters give the reader a different perspective of this tumultuous time as seen through the eyes of a man and his family caught in the middle of it.Percival Chen is headmaster of a school that teaches English to Vietnamese in Cholon, a suburb of Saigon.It is the early 1960’s and business is good as an ever-growing presence of American military personnel in the country means there is an increasing need for translators.Chen is a weak individual, a gambler and whore-monger while at the same time pompous and arrogant. Because of his vices and his pride he is incapable of making a realistic assessment of unfolding events and his changing circumstances.And events are indeed unfolding, momentous and violent ones, dramatically and rapidly. The war in Vietnam is coming to a bloody climax and neighbouring China is in the throes of the Cultural Revolution.The Headmaster’s Wager is a big story that embraces powerful issues like culture, family, love and betrayal, loyalty, war, espionage, profiteering and politics and yet it never falters.Vincent Lam has created a masterful plot full of unexpected twists and turns though none seem impractical or forced as the reader harkens back to revelations earlier in the narrative that were carefully embedded by the author.One of the few novels that is truly worthy of the prestigious Scotiabank Giller Prize.",
Great read,Very exciting book. I couldn’t put it down once I started reading.,
shocking language,"This book is on the list for the International Baccalaureate Organization for English A1 HL as an approved work under translation.  However, the language and themes are quite shocking, and I am nervous about introducing this to high school students.  I would never have put it on the syllabus or ordered so many copies of the book if I had known more about it.",
Amazing Nutrition Information!!,"I bought this book because I was interested in the nutrition aspects of vegetarianism.  This book has an amazing amount of nutrition information. It is a great resource for planning a complete vegetarian diet.  I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but there appears to be a great variety of recipes.  The book is worth having just for the nutrition information.",
Beautiful & underwhelming,This is a wonderfully written children's book but is not what I expected.  Andrea Beaty just set the bar too high.  Pro tip- Buy every single Questioneer book that is published!!!,

"Kids have bad hair days, too","The three star rating is only because I am horrible with hair and I thought I would get more in depth instruction.

I enjoyed the book and had several good laughs from the ...,"One must remember from start to finish that this book is extreme satire. After I accepted this, I enjoyed the book and had several good laughs from the extreme situations described that would otherwise go against most of my values.",
Take off your shirt and wallow in the luscious footnotes,"The night I heard about this book, I could barely sleep. I love the War Poets of WWI, I love the Greeks, and I love the lectures of Prof. Vandiver (her lectures are available from The Teaching Company). Talk about an intersection of delights! Would it live up to my desires?Having read several books on the British literature of WWI (starting with The Great War and Modern Memory when I was in college), this was the most enlightening so far. Full of fascinating tidbits to support her conclusions, well edited, a lovely long read, and did I mention the great footnotes. (I'm a softie for good footnotes, and they were such a nice icing on a well-frosted cake.) It is a serious book, one that rewards a careful reader, but not full of specialized nomenclature known only to grad students. Give us more, Lizzie!(And if you've heard her lectures, you can hear her mellow Floridian accent run through the whole thing.)",
Insightful Devotional,"This little book provides big insight into God's Word.  The book is divided into 40 days worth of devotionals focusing on 40 questions that some are afraid to ask or free uncomfortable asking.  Not only will this book provide insight into those questions, it will provide answers to give to new Christians and those seeking God's will in their lives.  Even if you are a mature Christian with an understanding of the bible, this book will serve to be an invaluable tool for your own walk and for those you disciple.Some questions reflected upon in this book are:Why do I get angry with God?Why do I so easily  lose self-control?Why can't I overcome sin in my life?Why am I bored with church, the Bible, and Jesus?Why do I always feel exhauted?The author, C.D. Baker, uses scripture and life experiences to answer these questions.  You will no doubt relate to some of the 40 questions in this book.  You will also know those in your life who will relate as well.  I have found in my personal walk with the Lord that once I ask the tough questions, I find myself closer to God and walking straight on the path laid before me.Book provided by Waterbrook for purpose of review.",
Love,Love this book. Great for fifth graders.,
Another fun N. Roberts book,"I thought this was a great ending to the Bridal Quartet.

Five Stars,Great,
Really Disappointing,"This 'book' consists of ONE page of a description of labyrinths and their uses throughout time, along with their 'mystical' properties. There are then rather repetitive renderings of various mazes and none of them intricate or engaging at all. I bought this thinking that at the very least there would be something cool to color or some new shapes or ideas but nada. I'm especially bummed because I like Wil Stegenga books. Honestly, even as just a plain old book this is rather lame. I'm not sure what the intention was in publishing it. Like I said, ONE page of text and 52 mazes. Pages are double sided.",
"Such a great, fast read!","I don’t normally have time to read at home. I took this book on vacation. It captured my attention right away. I got lost in this beautiful love story. If I had to put it down, I was excited to pick it up again. Highly recommend!",
100% Deliciousness ~,"Just received this cookbook yesterday! In reading through, nearly every page is tagged to prepare!! This is going to be a VERY well loved cookbook in my house!!Proceeds of these cookbooks go back to their locations to help the people!! All around benefit to everyone. It's beautiful.",~
"Good pictures, very poor organization","Finding anything is very difficult. At the beginning of the chapters there are great tables that show all of the topics/subtopics covered in the chapter but they reference no page numbers. To make things worse the topic section titles are turned into sentences that often times don't even contain the topics name in them. If you want to find anything in this book you have to use the index for everything. Also the pages are so thin you can see through them, and I don't mean barely see through them, you can read the words on the next page. The paper quality is literally comparable to some bibles and if you take any notes with pens/highlighters they will bleed through.Content wise I like the pictures more in this book than in my copy of Robbins, but the way it is organized and with how thin the pages are it is hard to justify using it instead.",
How can you go wrong with Dr. Seuss?,We have bought about ~20 Dr. Seuss books thus far.  All of them are great to sit and read to the grandkiddos!,~
Lovely Read,"Sarah Rosenthal's long-awaited book Manhatten is a deeply introspective yet lyrical read about her time spent in New York City. The characters and humor popped off the page, and the setting was a vivid recollection of the city (which I especially appreciated because I grew up in New York). But the book is not just a portrait of Manhattan, it's Rosenthal's portrait of Manhattan. It's about her relationship with the city (and with being young and insecure and inspired and in search of one's identity IN the city). I think this is one reason why the title spells the city's name incorrectly - because this Manhattan is a private Manhatten, a skewed Manhatten. I loved this aspect of it, this searching for your footing in the big city that is only just a symbol or microcosm of the big world. I certainly had my own private relationship with Manhattan as a young adult, and this brought me back to that time of uncertainty, excitement, and the sense that everything simultaneously hangs in the balance and lies up ahead.",
Perfect condition. Just what I expected,Brand new.  Perfect condition.  Just what I expected.  quick shipping,
Great book,Loved the dialogue and character development.  Enjoyed hearing about post war Germany on the east side. Learned couple things I was not aware of such as people in gdr really did love their country. Looking forward to more books,
"Great intro to Danish, wish there were a longer version too","This was my first Pimsleur course.  It is remarkable how well it teaches you a spoken language - all of which you can do in your car.  Because they are constantly asking you how to put together words and phrases that you know, they reinforce what you have learned and force you to invent new combinations.  Very effective.  Unfortunately there isn't a longer version of this available.  It is just 10 lessons.",
A painful portrait of the poor in Colombia,"This book is a chilling collection of voices first published in the UK.  The accounts come from the very poor in Colombia.  To that end, most of the voices are female.  Journalist Constanza Ardila Galvis does an outstanding job of capturing the views of the poor in the Colombian countryside.  However, she is guilty on two counts.  One...the views are overwhelmingly pro-guerrilla and secondly her prose is too melodramatic.  Nevertheless, this is an important book that documents the suffering of the rural and urban poor war inside Colombia.  Two quotes stuck in my mind when I finished this book.  The first was by Laura who said,""the hatred against those who persecute and murder us kept me in the struggle.""  And Angela who said, ""I continue to be convinced we must keep dying, giving birth and bringing up soldiers for the revolution.""  On a positive note, all the voices in this book conclude that a non-violent and just solutions must be sought in Colombia.  The bad news is that no one knows how to get there.",

Houshold simplification based on big family examples in article style chapters,"The book is a summary of blog entries, which is mentioned in the headline.The articles themselves are focused on a big multi-generation family, which renders some advice too specific and hard to &#34;downsize&#34;.Overall the topics give you an idea how to &#34;declutter&#34;, fun anecdotes are included, the chapters - based on original articles lacked for me a red line for structure.If you look for a quick read on how to deal with family clutter and probably won't read the book in one sitting but each article individually this might be just the perfect book for you.",
A Killer Midlife: (Witching After 40 Book 10),"Loaded with joy,pain,success,failure and a ton of unexpected twists, this book really delivers! The romance was top notch, the humor really delivers. The best of all the reads up to now. I'm excited for the rest!",

Two things we need more of today...Devotion to Christ and more horses.,Beautiful photography that goes along perfectly with the spoken word.  There are two things this world needs....IMO.  More devotion to Christ and more horses.,
"LOVE these books, just like i remember!!!",Just like I remembered it when I was a kid! A great book with neat illustrations! I feel like even as an adult I can always learn a thing or two from the Frances books (like how to get my toddler to eat better using reverse psychology). The only bummer is I can't quite do the voices the way my mom did.,
Entitlement Isn't Nice,Don't jump to conclusions. Entitlement on the surface is not what you think. As defined by Townsend entitlement is expecting things to be easy and blaming others for the hardness of life. It is expecting people to recognize your greatness and treat you favorably.  It may start when you say to a young girl she is pretty and leaving her to feel she must be pretty to be accepted.  Townsend talks about a hard way in contrast to the easy way.  I found this book to be a delightful read and would recommend it for parents in the raising of their children. Get this book and read it. Pass it on.,
"Surprisingly, awesome!","This case is amazingly thin and does offer some protection. It has a matted feel and has plastic bumpers. Keep in mind, even though it offers some protection, this is no otter box. But definitely a &#34;must have&#34; if you don't like bulky cases.",

Enthralled!!,"An author, Seeley James, from Elements 42, recommended Brett Battles’ books to me. Mr. James recommended the Excoms series, which I did purchase all four books from the series, then my eyes strayed towards the Jonathan Quinn series…received a complimentary ebook, The Cleaners, from him..that’s all it took…couldn’t put the book down..and, yes, Mr. Battles also owes me “some” forty winks, but it was worth every minute that I didn’t sleep..currently, I am waiting for the second installment to arrive. Not to worry, while waiting, I am currently reading the second book of the Excoms series…I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good book.",

Great Book! But.......,"I was really excited to get this book because my son stuggles with history. We already had the textbook through our homeschool curriculum. There is only one problem. There is NO answer key! It is very time consuming to have to check his work without an answer key. Although I know the answers to the questions (or most of them), I don't always have the time, nor does it help in gauging if his answer needs elaboration.  I think it is totally ridiculous to not provide an answer key, thus, I only give this book 2 stars. It would have gotten 5 otherwise.",
"Good grief, this was fun !!!","I found this adventure of a book quite entertaining and worth the read.  Had me either smiling, snickering or laughing out loud through out each chapter with its innuendos, slapstick sarcasm, and double entendres.

"""Lion Man"" ""Green Eyes"" loved it","The Secret Enemy Saga “Fracture” Book #1 by Virginia McKevittWhere do I start??? I just recently had the pleasure of meeting Virginia McKevitt at a book signing function in New Orleans.  I hadn’t heard of her as an Author and was not familiar with her work.  I read all types but heavy into the paranormal, erotic, sci fi and contemporary romance.  None of which really are YA or NA.  I picked up both the books at the signing and promised Virginia I would read them.  Well since I hadn’t brought my kindle with me I decided to start the first book.  I was a little tired and didn’t get far along.  I didn’t have the chance to pick it back up until I got back from New Orleans.When I started reading I’ll be honest I wasn’t sure if this was something for me, I realize the first few chapters most authors set up the characters so it might be a tad slow, once we got past the formalities of the characters (BTW the set up was actually very interesting.  Good back ground info for later in the read), the read took off.  OMG I so wasn’t expecting that.Kristina based on all accounts is one feisty, strong willed, strong headed no nonsense young lady.  When her parents were murdered she didn’t crumble and fall apart, now don’t get me wrong, yes she was devastated, but she was out to seek revenge.  She wanted to see whoever did this dead. Kristina was what we might call a half breed. That’s all I’m saying on this subject. In comes Tegrin Guardian/Assassin and the King’s right hand man. Tegrin was sent on a mission by his King to dispose of the Couton (A clan of Women who feed off others emotions) who had found the opening between the two worlds.  They wanted out from under the King to do as they pleased.  On top of the pleasure they experienced from feeding on the memories of the humans they were experiencing other emotions and it became an addiction.  In the small town of Blessings the bodies were piling up and Tegrin was sent to stop them. It’s in Kristina’s home Tegrin meets his destiny “Kristina” (grant it he doesn’t know that yet).  Tegrin was to get in and out and not let any humans see him.  That didn’t work out so well. He ends up allying with Kristina’s two friends Sissy and Jimmy and of course Sissy’s dog Bo a retired CIA operative in order to stop the Couton.  So much for humans not finding out.There was a lot unknown about Kristina and we do find out what she is.  The story played out perfectly.  From the tattoo appearing after her first kill, to her warrior like instincts. What happens when she finds her real Dad’s military foot locker left to her when he died, to her going to Potwain with Tegrin to meet her Grandfather and be trained as a guardian and taught how to use her powers.  She’s the best of both worlds.There is a little touch of humor, for example when Tegrin brings Ahmor (a Guardian) to train and fight with Kristina (because he can’t be around her) and she breaks his nose. My favorite was when Kristina smacked Maketi’s nose (Tegrins Stallion).  Now you have to understand everyone feared Tegrin but they feared his horse also.  She had those two spinning.  She showed absolutely no fear.  As in all good reads there is a sad part but you’ll need to read for yourself I don’t want to give too many spoilers.  Hmmmm but I’m going to give one now Tegrin and Kristina do the deed. YES.  The stone cold hearted Assassin who has no emotions fell for our girl.  Everyone saw it.  The King, her grandfather everyone.  I loved it.  Now I can’t wait to jump into “The Hunted” Kudos Virginia I really did love it.",

A captivating memoir,"I started this book this afternoon, intending to read one chapter. And hour later, I was so caught up in the story that I read the whole thing. Dinner was late. It was worth it.Girl at the End of the World is a memoir by Elizabeth Esther,  a woman who grew up in a fundamentalist branch of Christianity founded by her grandfather.  It’s essentially the story of what happens when enthusiastic followers of Jesus (her grandparents were influenced by the Jesus Movement) slowly shift from the faith that drew them in and get wrapped up in rules and behavioral codes and the strict dictates of one charismatic, unaccountable leader.The storytelling here is so good. The author masterfully shares the scenes of her childhood without bitterness – towards God, faith, or her family. It’s impressive, and the book is one of the best I’ve read in this genre.  I was surprised by how relatable this story is. I grew up as far away from a faith based cult as one can imagine, and yet I feel like I want to sit down with the author, pour a glass of wine, and talk about the amazing ways God works in our lives. She really succeeds in making readers feel like friends.The story is divided into three sections: her childhood, her experience breaking out and trying to navigate mainstream culture, and then her process of figuring out a new way to engage with God outside of her strict, abusive upbringing. I loved it all. Her descriptions of her childhood are so vivid, I felt like I was right there (which was difficult at times – there are some tough moments).  Her take on first encountering Oprah Winfrey’s show and how quickly television commercials stirred up a dissatisfaction with her life she’d never felt before is a great reminder of how much we’re being manipulated by what we watch.  And there’s a real sweetness to how God pursues her as she and her husband seek a new way to raise their own family.Note: I received a copy of this manuscript from the publisher in exchange for a review.",
"Tender, Funny, Provocative","The Twelve is a beautiful fable of what 2012 just might mean to us all. Max, the hero, is a classic, modern ""everyman,"" struggling with work, romance and a creepy brother. He tries to listen to his inner voice, but it seems to go quiet for long periods as he tackles ""real life."" Sound familiar? Unlike many overzealous metaphysical books, The Twelve is quite amusing in a very human way. Like another reviewer here, The Twelve reminds me a lot of The Celestine Prophecy. But the ""spiritual"" scenes are a lot better; they're done with respect and finesse. All in all: Tender, Funny and Provocative.",
Good but not SEP's best,"I am a huge SEP fan - her books have had me laughing out loud and crying too, but I didn't feel the same emotional connection in this book.  Of course this is a well written book and the dialogue is engaging, but I agree with many others that there wasn't enough of a story line to fill the book, and in the end was predictable.And to the reviewer who said this seemed to mirror Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie vs. Jennifer Aniston saga -- I thought the same thing!!!So, all in all, worth reading if you are a SEP fan, but rent it from the library as it won't be one you are likely to re-read.",
5 star author and story!,I couldn’t put it down!,
Four Stars,Enjoyed the humor a lot. Good story.,
Steroids?,"The author looks like she’s (unfortunately) on steroids, which undermines the fitness  message, although there is some good info.",
"well crafted, old-fashioned style thriller","First of all, I read the book because I learned that JK Rowling had written it under a pseudonym. As an adult, I read the Harry Potter books and loved them, and now, my 11-year old daughter loves them also. Though their target was another age group, I noticed that, if you looked close enough, the situations, comments, etc., portrayed in the books hinted at a world of values that had permeated the fantasy story without burdening it without need. Afterwards, I read The Casual Vacancy and was confirmed in my theory. Now, with the first Cormoran Strike book, I was once again confirmed that, quite apart from the HP books, JKR is a writer on her own right. Come to think of it, the HP books are also a kind of whodunnit .... If you enjoy an old-fashioned thriller, with lots of sociological allusions, all of them absolutely functional to the story, slow-paced but not dragging, with twists and turns, character development and good vocabulary, I think you will enjoy this book.",
Disappointing for Nelson,"I thought I would want to read whatever Blake Nelson published, but I was wrong. Girl was by far his best book, but this one was a big letdown. The characters were uninteresting and sometimes repellent, the poems inserted every now and then added nothing to the work (and bored me), and the ""gritty city"" subject matter just didn't interest me.It's possible that the NYC writing scene could really dig this, but I didn't. (And I like Neresian.) Not really worth the time.",
Good buy,Very nice quality coloring book,
Fast-paced and interesting read!,I liked how each chapter was told from the perspective of a different character as the story unfolds. Everyone had a different voice and different stakes.  I enjoyed it very much!,
"Lyrical, haunting masterpiece","Incredible writing and a vivid sense of place make ""Housekeeping"" a modern masterpiece, marred only by a bit of Oprah Book Club-style melodrama. The lake and the Idaho community this book is set in come to life as a kind of timeless archetype of the Far West, complete with climate calamities, sudden violence and extreme isolation. In some spots, Robinson's lyricism makes the plot a bit hard to follow, but that said, certain images from this book will stay with me forever.",
Captivating Read,Intriguing and captivating. Loved the characters.  Was eager to keep reading but sad for the book to come to an end.,

This funny, strange, and haunting graphic novel explores our relationship with art (as both creators and consumers) through deceptively simple pen and ink drawings. In fact, I think that simplicity is important to its charm-- the cartoonish portrayal of the characters makes them feel vulnerable and innocent, which lends a sense of humanity to the abstract narrative. The metaphors here are powerful and thought-provoking, but not inscrutable. Any reader who loves art is bound to feel what what it means, and see themselves within these pages.",
"An intelligent, intriguing, mysterious work.","This book surprised me. I guess I've been let down so many times by poorly conceived, blandly written and inadequately edited books that I assumed 'She Does Not Fear The Snow' would be more of the same. Not so.Bobbie Ann Cole is an intelligent writer who has produced a perceptive and well written account of a significant life event. The heart of the book rests on three catalytic events: Cole's cancer diagnosis, her failed marriage and her examination of Hebrew and Christian faith.In a form of pilgrimage Cole travels from England to Israel, Switzerland and Canada, along the way encountering remarkable people and events. Her guide and confidant is often Terry, an impish, intuitive, serendipitous lover of life who emerges from her log cabin in Canada to join Cole in mystical discovery. The  friendship leads to another person - a quiet, humorous man who engages Cole in ways that surprise her.The romantic interludes may be of more interest to female readers but it is the stunning mysticism that intrigues me. Throughout Cole bravely approaches events that appear to supersede logic. Some are natural: an eagle flying beside her for miles on a frozen river, whitetail deer approaching fearlessly, the menacing, powerful appearance of a moose. And there are unexpected human events including the offering of a rug and its emergence as a map defining Cole's and Terry's natures and perhaps their futures.'She Does Not Fear The Snow' examines suffering, searching, finding and the place of mystery in transforming lives. It is a testament to friendships honed on a crucible of truth. This is an honest book that takes chances and gets away with it.",
So it Goes.,"I really enjoy the vast majority of the Modern Classics but Slaughterhouse-Five just didn't make the cut.  I didn't put this book down at all after I started reading it because I just wanted it to be over.  The story was too out there.Kurt Vonnegut wrote this book to protest war, but I think that he failed horribly at that.  The only reason I even gave this book two stars was because of the humorous moments in the story.",
Training!!,Great Air Force story.,
I'll keep looking,"I expected more - this is not very well written or well organized. It's not terrible, but I kept feeling like the author's mind works completely differently from mine, but in my experience this is usually a sign that an author isn't doing a good job communicating. The graphics aren't very helpful either.",
Good book.,Good reading.,
Oh my!,"Truly a memoir of mixed emotions starting on page one. I loved this story. Reminiscent of my mother's storyline., growing up in Kiev.",
excellent book,"well written and although a part of a  series, it stands alone. I like the respectwith which the Native American aspects are treated.",
Great Writing Lessons for GED,It's one of the main books we use in our GED related classes.  I bought it for a student's summer use.,
"The Russian may be OK, but some English words are mispronounced","Listen to the audio sample provided: this is essentially a long list of vocabulary words that are recited, first, in English, then in Russian, with a pause in between.  I was going to buy this, but listening to a list of words seems a bit boring.  In addition, the narrator has a strong accent (in English) and mispronounces some English language words (e.g., ""bicycle"", ""boat"").  If that doesn't bother you, this may be fine for learning Russian if you don't mind listening to a long list of words.  But it is quite obvious from the sample audio that the narrator is not a native English speaker.",
Very happy I bought this book!,Lots of interesting details - and good photos as well.,
Good Read,"I loved learning about the three generations of women and what their life was like. Their stories are told in a heart felt,eye opening way. This is a long read but it keeps you coming back to find out what happened next.",
Coben is always a good read.,"Drop Shot is involved enough to keep one's interest throughout the book, but not so complicated that it is hard to follow. There are twists enough so that I could not figure out 'who done it' until near the end. That makes it a good read.",
Good for the inexperienced but weird to reach out on Instagram for a sale,"I was enjoying the book despite the likeability of the main character. She paints herself in a very real way, but pushes her insecurities to the forefront more often than is admirable. My least favorite part about all of this is the fact that when I was 3/4 of the way through the book, I decided to follow her on Instagram. Probably a day or so later she sent an obviously copy and pasted message to me on Instagram saying thanks for the follow and that I should check out her book. It honestly rubbed me the wrong way. This whole book is about her dealing with her insecurities but it was a little earth shattering to get a current message from her obviously still dealing with being incredibly insecure. I bought this book because I'm an adventure climber and I wanted to read more accounts of women in the wilderness, but this was not the story I wanted to hear.",
"Everything you need, no frills though","The booklets covered all the material that was on the test. It wasn't the most exciting read and lacked some of the diagrams and formulas that I would have hoped for, but if you have the time to study all of this book, you should be fine on the test.",
How to use the Windows Command Line,"This book presents a clear explanation of some of the commands that can be used with the Windows Command line. The author provided the meaning of various acronyms like FAT and NTFS  for example, and others, of which the reader may not know the meaning.  Even though I started computering with DOS, and the command line is a leftover of that system, I felt that the book provided helpful reminders of how to navigate with basic commands.  The author's warning to cautiously use some of the commands is well taken because the command line is a powerful tool and not forgiving if the user makes a mistake.  I liked the book and believe that it is a good read for one who is interested in knowing what the Windows Command Line can do.",
"Best book in interesting trilogy about US Navy career, flying in F-14 Tomcat fighter","As other reviewers have indicated, Dave “Bio” Baranek has completed his trilogy of books about his US Navy career, flying in the F-14 Tomcat fighter, with a flourish. He has written what many, including myself, find to be the “best of the best” among his three excellent books.Bio takes you through his Tomcat flying days from the time he left the Navy’s Topgun school as a still-young Topgun Instructor, all the way through the rest of his 20-year Navy flying career… as he advances in experience, rank, and responsibilities… to eventually became the Commander of an F-14 Squadron.Tomcat RIO also provides a look at how the previously air-to-air-only Tomcat adapted to a new additional role as a “Bombcat”,  with potent LANTIRN-assisted day and night air-to-ground strike capabilities. Bio details the varied real world armed-and-ready missions his squadron of Tomcats flew in support of Operation Southern Watch. This was the joint operation enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq, which was implemented following Gulf War One.If you like books about military aviation, I predict you'll like this one....  it's a keeper for the personal aviation library.

Good read,"As always with Cussler there is a good historical bent to the book.  He always weaves an intro story to set the scene for what will eventually take place.  I love the interaction between the macho hero types, be it Pitt or Austin and their cronies.  I don't miss a Cussler book and this was a good read.  It's not his best and I did miss him in the book.  If you like Cussler, you'll like this book.",
Not what I was looking for,Maybe alright for some people. I wanted more information on the formation of rocks. I didn't return it and will give it to my club.,
"Great resource, great inspiration","I like others received a full copy for an honest review, I think it is a great resource for both new GMs and experienced ones alike. I thought the tables were great because sometimes you get in a rut designing new dungeons and just a simple roll can get you out of that and thinking a new way. Sometimes answering what the walls look like for the 15th time that night you can have a new response.If I had known about it before I was offered it I would have gladly purchased it. In fact I enjoy it so much I am considering having it printed myself so that I can have when I design dungeons as I still prefer to draw them by hand. The section on dungeon designing was very much needed as when I started 20 years ago, we did not think about the realities of how did monsters get there, we just created a dungeon and filled it with things to go boo. Now with this you think more about the ecology of how monsters and that river got there.If you ever agonize about what to make the 5th room look like, or create a dungeon at the 11th hour pick this book up. If sometimes you need inspiration, pick this book up, I saw no cons with this book and have thoroughly enjoyed using this resource.",
Ended up loving it!,"The first page was a little hard for me to focus on but after that I was hooked. Jane builds excellent characters. The book had unexpected twists and hidden deeper meanings. I couldn't put it down once the plot was revealed. It made me smile, cry and it made me think about the life I'm living. Thank you Jane Smiley.",
Buckle up,"This is book #8 of the Gabriel Allon series, and at this point, the art restorer/spy/assassin feels an old and dear friend.

AMAZING BOOK!!!!!MUST READ!!!!!!!!!,I’m living proof of this book. So proud of my mommy I can’t believe she told my brother & I story to the world. It is such a beautiful story & I am so grateful for both my parents. I love them so much & they are the most amazing parents in the world. Being adopted I don’t care they are not my biological parents to me they are my real parents. I love this book,
Wonderful book,Wonderful book. Arrived in fine condition.,
Not bad.....slow read!,Not one of his best....lots of analyzing things in his head and from the past...the end had some good action but overall just average.,
Wonderful Calendar,Well made and plenty of room in each day so you can plan and keep track of your life.  Lovely Collie on the front is a boon.  A must for the busy Collie fan in your life.,

... Julie Nutting doll stamps and this book gives some pretty good ideas and tips for using the stamps,I have recently discovered Julie Nutting doll stamps and this book gives some pretty good ideas and tips for using the stamps. I would definately recommend it.,
Historical disappointment,"I cannot stand this book.  The author's writing suggests that all that is left is good and all that is right is evil.  He rewrites the history of the fall of communism to try and show Bush and Reagan as fools, while conveniently skipping the Carter years. The Pillars of the Earth will always be one of my favorite books, but I am not sure I will ever read another Ken Follett book after this horrible experience.",
Five Stars,good book,
Great book!,"A timeless classic. Although, hard to read without tearing up. 😉",😉
OUTSTANDING! Incredibly MOTIVATING!,Kelso does it again in this adaptation of Romeo and Juliet for young people! My sixth graders seized upon this book and mounted their own production in just 2 days with absolutely no adult assistance! The author knows just the right words to get kids motivated to read and perform this work. My entire class is now captivated by Shakespeare and wants to learn more about his work and life. Anyone who teaches young people can really use this book!,
You must read A Candidate for Murder!!!,Wow what a page turner! And like her first book with these characters-- Inn Keeping with Murder it has an important social justice message. The writing is very witty and engaging. I hope she keeps this series going because I can't wait to hear what is next for these women!,
Not a let down,I cannot believe how amazing this was for me. Loved the time travel aspect and twist and turns. A book that I couldn't determine the outcome of. Great job Mr. Saul!,
Nice but could've been handled better,Wow some of my beauty and the beast items have not been coming in the greatest condition. Nice book for my collection I'm working on. There was a big dent in the front of the book and a rip on the back. I guess I will still keep it.,

DONT GIVE UP!!!,"I have not seen the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"" and at my 3rd attempt at reading the book, I finally finished. The lanuage is very hard to understand AT FIRST. Once you get more into the book, it starts to clear up. My message is this: Do not give up on reading it. Its GREAT.",
I want a dog like Wrigley when I move into senior care hopefully much much later in life,"Loved this book which detailed the life of Wrigley, a 4-legged canine caregiver at a home for senior adults (nursing home in my southern vernacular).  Told from the dog's point of view.  Highlights why I love dogs so much.  Treats the aged with dignity.  I highly recommend this book if you're a dog lover.",
Wonderful book!!!!,"My 8 year old boy read this and immediately asked for more like this!  He loved these books.  They take the kids into the Middle Ages with three fictional kids from our time.  Plus they fill it with fun facts from that time period.  A great book, for learning and for fun reading!",
My favorite so far!!!!,I loved this book. It has been my favorite so far of the Silver Springs Series. The story was very well written.In the story you are just never sure how if Ellie and Hudson will ever find each other. These books even though they are a series are stand alone books.,
Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it.,"To keep it simple, I bought this as a gift for my wife who is an absolute Christmas junkie and starts planning the next Christmas somewhere just before Valentine's Day.  This book is very short, but it hits home with ladies that are like her and all the female ""Clark Griswald's"" of the world.  It's about overdoing Christmas and it struck a chord with her on almost every page.  I read through it, she read it, and she laughed a lot - I take that as a good sign.  I've also noticed most people who don't like this book are not from the south.  Surprise, if you're from Montana, you're probably not going to find this book very amusing.  Also, if you're not a chronic Christmas over-achiever, you're also probably not going to find this book very interesting.Not a bad little book at all and I'd recommend it for anyone with a wife who thinks she's Martha Stewart.  My only complaint, it is a brief read - one or two hours, tops, and you're done with this book - not very much text.",
Nice,This was bought for some friends that just got a new RV.  Good for them but first part is too focused on what to buy,
One of the best books ever written and series developing,"The first couple of pages into the book I thought this was just going to be one of those stories but what a twist, I was so surprised and thrilled with this book, that I grabbed off of my teachers shelf to borrow, that I stayed up all night reading it then bought the next one, silver eyes, online the next day, I've been waiting for the third book, angel eyes, and encouraging Nicole Luiken on Facebook to continue to write it, I can't wait! if you go on Facebook she posted a link to read the first two chapters of angel eyes for FREE its going to be fantastic!",
Nice condition,"It's a good book. But I don't like it as a textbook, the words are too small and it's content is very lengthy. The book is in great condition though.",
Irvine Welsh strikes again,"if you like his books, you'll love this one!  almost everything i've read is great!  can't wait for the next book!",
Great Book - Did not Like Oprah Notes,"I loved the book.  Sue Monk Kidd's new book is almost as good as &#34;Bees&#34;.  I read the Kindle edition.  The Oprah comments are extremely annoying to me.  As I read a new book, I like to form my own conclusions and opinions.  With the Oprah underline and directions to read and return, I was continually reminded that this was just a book.  About the time I would lose myself in the text again, there was another Oprah comment.  I like Oprah.  I would like to have read her comments AT THE END of the book.  With my Kindle Paperwhite, I could only &#34;turn the page&#34; without reading the comments by very carefully touching the screen to turn the page--and when I did go to the comments, I did not always get back to where I had been.  I am giving the book 5 stars--a great story, beautifully told.  But I will never again buy one with notes from Oprah.",
Fell short,"I've had this book on my shelf for a while but never read it until now... I recently rewatched a couple of documentaries then the movie and I wanted to compare. There were a lot of inconsistencies across everything.  This book was clearly written for Azie for absolution and I hope he felt that he achieved that.I will give credit where credit is due and I believe others should do the same.  I don't think Azie did that. It seemed to me the he was taking more credit than I felt was due to him with the influence him, Rich, and Alpo had on EVERYTHING,  but then, that's just me.  There was an excessive amount of name-dropping in the book as well, from DJs, rappers, and singers to actors and music producers. Was that really necessary? Azieboasted about the flashy, customized cars with the sound systems and wearing customized jewelry to match the cars, the money, and the flashy clothes,  then turned right around and said something about keeping a low profile... yeah, no...After watching the documentaries and the movie and reading the book, I have my thoughts and opinions about dude's role in the game and what would've happened hadn't certain other people not have gone to jail. It's his story though and he told it well enough.I had higher hopes but the book just fell short. Maybe my expectations shouldn't have been so high? I get that he wanted to write the book to tell about the ugly part of the game but I'm not so sure he accomplished that. It seemed to me to hype up his experience while telling what could happen if things go wrong... I felt it could have been better.",
"Only alright, much better of the Touch and Feel collection.","We have a lot of the Baby Touch and Feel books but this one gets a miss with my two little ones. Oddly balloons on the cover aren't inside as a first word. I only mention that because usually cover art is featured on a page inside, not that I miss it as a word for them, but the collection as a whole doesn't hold their attention as much as most of the other Touch and Feel books. Seems like random things just tossed in rather than any firsts for babies you'd think to put in. Would skip this one.",
Five star book. One star author editorial. Wish I could give it a five.,"Great story that really captured my attention. Two different plots that tangled together nicely with some unexpected twists. However, when reading the author's view on the have's and have not's in the world and how every one ""deserves"" things just because they exist, I immediately became turned off and will not read or recommend this author. Entitlement is a HUGE problem in our society. No one deserves anything. If a person wants to go to college, that's great. Take out student loans like I did. And pay them back, like I did and shut up about it. I didn't expect someone to give me a free education just because I exist. I worked damn hard for it. Then I got a job that offered excellent benefits so I had great health care. Before then, my parents covered my through their great jobs that they worked hard to earn benefits through. No one DESERVES anything just because they exist. There is no such thing as ""free.""  If you, Daniel, want people educated and insured, who do think is going to pay for that? The rich, you say? Because they ""deserve"" it?  Unfortunately it will be me, the middle class paying, not the rich. I already pay for other people's health care, while I have my own, so I guess I should now pay for their education, too. If someone wants to go to college, pay for it -- student loans are available -- or don't go. It's that easy. Unfortunately, our esteemed President has made it impossible to go without insurance, even if you're a man and don't need prenatal care -- according to law, you still must carry it. But get a job and EARN the benefit instead of being a leach on society and thinking it's DESERVED. I really enjoyed the book, but you ruined it with your ""debt free, free health"" nonsense. There is no free.",
Five Stars,Good Read,
Another Marti McAlister book where she must juggle home life with murder.,Best so far.,
Good read,Sweet story.  Our five year old really likes it and asks for this story.  He loves the animals.,
Terrific Treatment of a Difficult and Complex Subject,"I really said it all in the title to my review. This is an enormously useful book that opens the expansive (and still rapidly expanding) world of APIs to PHP programmers like myself. His writing is meticulously clear, the examples work (or at least get you nine-tenths of the way there), and the chapters on actual APIs (PayPal, eBay, FedEx, Google, etc.) are useful. Of course, I'd have loved even more chapters on still other APIs (there are so many), but you'll probably learn enough about Web APIs from these examples to tackle any not covered. Easy download access to the source code is also appreciated.I was personally less interested in the section on Web Feeds, but this is also well presented -- interestingly in context as a counterpart of Web APIs.One final word: To get the most out of this book, you need to be an intermediate level PHP programmer. (If you're not, I recommend ""PHP and MySQL Web Development"" by Welling and Thomson as a good way to get there -- particularly if you're interested in tapping the power of MySQL along with PHP.) But back to the book in hand: 5 stars with thanks to Mr Reinheimer.",
Incredible,I purchased 2 of these for Christmas presents. One for my daugher (7) and one for my neice (10). They both LOVED them. The pictures are beautiful and inspiring. The women who wrote these words were truly inspired. An excellent book for any age.,
My honest assessment of the book.,"Skill for Growing by Charles Dowding is a gardening book meant to help and teach the reader how to grow his own vegetables in the garden all year around. I liked how the author provided only the essential pieces of information without charging the book with useless words. I liked how it takes you from 0 to the final product so that you can find an answer to any question regarding your garden, from how to prepare the ground, the space needed between seeds and plants, the characteristics and proper time to plant each seed, how to grow strong seedlings, the rotation between vegetables, and many others. I also appreciated the visual support provided by all the pictures and tables that can be found in every chapter.",
One of the WORST Earp-Tombstone books ever written!,"This book is an absolute disaster. I received an ARC of Clavin's latest ""study"" of Tombstone and while he alleges through his bibliography that he cited numerous credible sources in his research he clearly did not use the information to his advantage. Please, save your money on this error-filled book. It was lazily written and poorly executed. Among the true historians of Earp and Tombstone history, this will surely go down as one of the worst books ever written on the subject.",
Frist hand review of actual cases,"I like the first hand review of cases because I was familiar with several of them, but not in the detail that the book furnishes.",
Love it,Kept me on my toes.,
A Fun Read,"I enjoyed reading this and plan on reading it again. The protagonist takes a while to grow on you, but by the end of the book you are sorry to see it end.",
Real Story of Moby Dick,"This book is an amazing read. Makes a subject that I could've cared less about (whaling) very interesting. Well written and exhaustively researched. The story in itself is an amazing tale of greed, pride, adventure, and tragedy. My copy came in fair condition, as promised, and within the delivery window I was given. A+ Bookseller. Would definitely purchase from them again!",+
Five Stars,Bought this to help me learn French vocabulary and have found it very helpful.,
Great settings for this multi-generational quest for answers!,This author takes us on a journey that crosses and ocean and generations. The protagonist is the product of a rich family history and unanswered questions. In the process of trying to get answers she encounters some very dark characters in a remote and desolate place. Nice twists and turns to keep you reading towards an interesting resolution.,

"THEY TOO WERE AMERICANS: THE GERMAN-AMERICAN BUND IN WORDS, PHOTOS,AND ARTIFACTS","THEY TOO WERE AMERICANS: THE GERMAN-AMERICANS BUND IN WORDS, PHOTOS, AND  ARTIFACTSSCOTT FREELANDR. JAMES BENDER PUBLISHING, 2011HARDCOVER, $66.95, 320 PAGES, PHOTOGRAPHS, BIBLIOGRAPHY, ACRONYMS, TERMSThe 1930's proved to be a fertile time for demagogues and radical movements to appear in the United States, whether on the left or the right of the political spectrum. Huey Long combined populism with quasi-dictatorial rule in Louisiana while Father Charles R. Coughlin broadcast a popular national radio program blending religion, economics, and politics, lacing it with ever-increasing amounts of anti-Semitism. With mainstream strands of anti-Semitism, popularity of the KKK and worsening economic conditions in the Great Depression, German-American ultra-nationalism provided a voice for thousands in America. This was another side to the ""melting pot"" theory by demonstrating how two different traditions converged in the United States with immigrant families offering new ideas to their local communities. These ideas also united other groups, such as German fascists in Long Island holding rallies with Italian fascists under the American flag. Indeed, the United States didn't escape public displays supporting fascism and the terrain served as grounds for different groups to ""melt"" their ideology together.The German-American Bund boasted in the late 1930s, that it had 250,000 members in 42 states-patriotic Americans all, dedicated to the democratic principles of the United States. Many of its leaders and members were sincere not only in their personal convictions but also in the best interests of their country-the United States. Yes, there were some who had negative attitudes towards Jews and other minorities but then so did the majority of Americans at that time. The author has unearthed that some Bund chapters had working relationships with Hispanic and other minority groups and even had some Jews as members. Yes, they flew the swastika because it was central to their racial identity.Discovering how the local Bund blended fascism and democracy has been made difficult by local hesitations to revisit a negative chapter of the past. This is further compounded when people seek to hide history. One notable example was in 1995 when Suffolk County, New York legislators passed a resolution, sponsored by Herb David (R-Yaphank), ""for the removal of pro-Nazi references on the subdivision records"" from original documents. This proposed re-writing of history on the original records failed since it wasn't approved by the state government. Despite these obstacles, this new book, THEY TOO WERE AMERICANS: THE GERMAN-AMERICAN BUND IN WORDS, PHOTOS, AND ARTIFACTS sheds a whole new light on an often neglected part of local and national history in order to paint a more accurate view of history prior to the U.S. entry into World War II.Author Scott Freeland skillfully uses primary documents to sketch a history of the Bundists as they might have viewed themselves as well as to be more understanding of the German-American Bund members place and time in the history of this country. His book (published by the well-known and respected R. James Bender) is a very detailed and well-written account with excellant photographs accompanying the text. As one reads this book, you are impressed with both the dedication and knowledge the author has managed to put together on a subject that has been not only overlooked but much misunderstood in our nation's history.Lt.

Excellent Introduction to Container Gardening!,"I'm new to gardening in any form, and I'm starting with containers. So far, I have bought containers. 🎉 I tried last year to grow tomatoes (one late frost took then all out), and strawberries (they migrated to other pots and took over but didn't yield much fruit). I had no idea what I was doing! I'm so happy to have this beautiful, comprehensive guide to growing food in container gardens!I love the organization of this book as well as the overall tone and style. This begins with explaining why container gardening has became important in our times and then moves on to detail how to prepare and gather the materials to be successful. This book never talks down to beginners like me, but it fills in the gaps between buy seeds... Then harvest. That's a big gap, and I love the way this book takes the reader through the process.I feel much more confident as spring approaches that I will be able to successfully grow food in my container garden. This book provides a wealth of information on overall strategies as well as particular techniques to use with different herbs, fruits, edible flowers, and vegetables. If you're looking to grow a successful container garden, this book is for you! Highly recommend!",🎉

"This is an amazing, wonderful book","As someone who think a lot about habits - and how they strengthen families, make children more resilient and happier, and give our lives deeper meaning - I can say, with absolute conviction, that this is one of my favorite books. Jenny Rosenstrach is a gifted writer, a warm and encouraging chef and, to anyone reading, the friend whom knows more about how I should live than I do myself. Buy this book.",

Relaxing into a better life is possible.,A very unique read. An absolute vibe. In our current culture to come into this relaxed form of eating is rare. In fact I've not met anyone my age that is into the artful slow style of fine dining. The book can get a bit slow and really hard to read at times as it goes into a vast series of topics but the vibe is really awesome.,
Story captivated me from start to finish,"A Jew was inside a German camp during WWII and experienced monstrosities in a more secret part of the camp.His Nazi guard with in the secret section, looked startling like this particular prisoner.  The guard took this one prisoner as his &#34;favorite&#34; but forced him to kill fellow Jews just to survive.No one incarcerated w/in the secret cell had gotten out alive except for this one Jew's impromptu cunningness.Many years later, after the war ended the Nazi guard was hiding in England to avoid being prosecuted as a Nazi.  Thinking the Jew was dead and buried in the trench w/scores of others at the camp, and, since he looked so alike the victim, he was able to pose as the Jew prisoner, taking on the Jew's name, and identity.The victim Jew, also, was living in England under another name.  Due to several murders of Jews in England, the two men were suspects of being the murderer.Each man claimed to be the same man.  A trial was held to determine who was whom.....Many twists within the tale.  I recommend reading this story.",

Definitely a must read for all historical fiction lovers.,"“When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.”----Nelson MandelaLucy Cruickshanks, an English author, has penned yet another enticing and poignant tale, The Road to Rangoon that is set across the beautiful yet sad land of Burma which is centered around three characters whose lives are entwined and engulfed in the clutches of the civil war against the Burmese Military Armed Forces, officially known as Tatmadaw.Synopsis:In 1980s Burma, the British ambassador’s son goes missing.Discovering himself in the north of the country, Michael Atwood is in imminent danger, trapped between sides fighting a bitter civil war and with no way back to Rangoon. His best hope of salvation is to trust Thuza, a ruby smuggler who offers to help him escape.Beautiful and deeply scarred, Thuza has spent her entire life in a frontier town between rebel and government forces, never choosing a side but trying to make a living from both. For Thuza, the ambassador’s son is her ticket out of poverty. For Than, an ambitious military officer, exploiting those caught in the war offers an opportunity for promotion and distinction.But as all three learn to their cost, in this enigmatic and savage country, everyone has a price.From the heart of Burma’s exotic Rubyland comes an emotional thriller, as three lives are thrown together by the desperate choices they make to survive in a country gripped by civil war: a tale of ambition, salvation and hope that confirms Lucy Cruickshanks as a master storyteller.Michael Atwood, the son of a British Ambassador in Burma goes missing and soon he realizes that he is caught in the war from both the sides and the power they holds on his capture is invaluable, that is when he needs to trust the only person who can help him to rescue from the grips of the rebels.Thuza, the local Burmese girl, is a ruby smuggler, who knows her job well like the back of her hand, on how to differentiate ruby from the rocks, as it is the only salvation to buy her parents' freedom from the right officials.Than, works and abides by the strict rules of the Tatmadaw army, is soon tested on his loyalty towards the Army, and he is forever desperate to climb the ladders of success by pleasing the General. Things change when he forces his son, Min, to join the forces and to take strict measures against those who wrong by the Armed Forces.These three lives in Burma, now known as Myanmar, will break the hearts of the readers as their lives unfold and when their fate plays a major role to bring them together under dire circumstances.The author has once again delivered a spectacular tale of love, freedom and loyalty towards one own government set against the back of another country from the far east- Burma, which harbors a difficult era in Burmese history, which not only torn apart the lives of the common man, but which made it impossible to survive under the dominance of the Tatmadaw army.The author has evocatively captured the time frame as well as the location with her eloquent words. The background of Burma is dominated by lush and dense green forests and the tombs of the many Buddhist temples and that the author has vividly captured in her story line. The land where beauty of mother nature and repressive army plays a major role, is well painted into the canvas of the story as the author strikingly captures the culture, the local dialect and the grief of the citizens through her story. The author has done her research quite well with the ways how to find a ruby among the rocks, where to find it, and also the governance of the army and their torture among common people.The author's writing style is spell-binding that I lost track of time as I devoured the novel in just one sitting. The book is highly addictive as articulate narrative shifts from one character to another. The pacing is really fast, despite the fact that the author has written the scenes descriptively, that made it easier for me to picture the events right in front of my eyes. The story is engrossing and kept me glued till the very end. The author has penned with so much deep, moving emotions and it definitely felt like she has poured all her best emotions into it.The characters are drawn with realism and simplicity. The challenges thrown on their track made me rooting for them. All the three characters are inspiring and sad laced with grief and their demeanor is something to watch out for when they are caught in the politics and the war with the government and they are bound to leave an impression long after the end of this powerful historical fiction. The story has a complex and nostalgic ending that definitely moved me. The supporting characters are highly well-developed.Overall the story is enthralling, thought-provoking and thoroughly gripping till the end set against the back drop of Burma in the late 20th century.",
"Great calendar, just small errors with names","Fantastic calendar!! Only took off 1 star because of the obvious errors on names for CASSIDY (not that previous name that shall not be mentioned, this mistake earned the deduction of a full star) and Mei. Unless, like the previous reviewer stated, we’re meeting her secret twin Mel in OW2. Lol! Otherwise, the calendar is well made and the graphics are awesome. I also love that holidays from all around the world are listed. Will definitely use this all year long 😉",😉
I only wish this Pas de Deux was Longer!,"I am again blown away by this talented author!  I loved 'seating arrangements' and am happy to report that ms. shipstead is not a one-hit wonder! 'astonish me' is a wonderful book that will have you wanting to watch movies such as 'the turning point' and 'white nights' and of course 'black swan'.  while this book isn't as broad as 'seating arrangements' - and that's my only complaint that this book is too short!!! - it's an intense story of the ballet world, and also a family drama and a love story...ms. shipstead is becoming one of my favorite authors with her deft story telling ability and wonderfully drawn characters...",
Prejudice,"To Kill a Mockingbird contains criticism of the prejudice and moral laziness that allowed Southern society to have a double standard of  justice. The novel also presents a somewhat optimistic view of white  Southerners that was somewhat unusual at the time the novel appeared. The  story indicates there are good human beings like Atticus Finch everywhere,  even in the midst of a corrupt society. Even those who do wrong, the novel  goes on to suggest, often act out of ignorance and weakness rather than a  deliberate impulse to hurt others.Another theme of the novel is the  transition from innocence to experience. At the beginning of the story  Scout's world is limited to the boundaries of her immediate neighborhood.  She feels safe and secure, and totally confident that the way things are  done in her home is not just the right way, but the only way. The arrival  of Dill, who comes from a broken home and has lived in another state, gives  Scout her first hint of a variety of experiences beyond her narrow  horizons. Then, on her first day of school, she begins to discover that not  everyone agrees that the way things are done in Maycomb, Alabama, is  necessarily correct. She also learns that sometimes it is necessary to  compromise in order to get along. Even though Scout's teacher's ideas about  how to teach reading may be wrong, Scout must respect the teacher's  authority. Her own father advises her to ignore the teacher's ban on  reading at home, but to pretend to go along with the teacher's methods  while in the classroom. This kind of social hypocrisy is new to Scout, and  she is surprised to hear her very moral father advocating it.Related to  the theme of innocence and experience is the novel's suggestion that  innocent children can often see large moral issues more clearly than  adults. Scout, Jem, and Dill never waver in their horror at the injustice  done to Tom Robinson. The adults in the story, however, see all the  complexities of the situation to the point of being blinded to the central  issue of right and wrong. However much Scout may grow through her exposure  to new experiences, one hopes that she will never lose her childlike  undertaking of justice. In the view of this novel's author, justice is a  simple concept. To recognize the difference between justice and injustice  does not take any special degree of wisdom or sophistication. In fact, the  learned members of the community--such as the judge and prosecutor--and the  proudly religious Baptists who are spectators at the trial are, willingly  or not, allied with the machinery of injustice.",
Even Better Than The First,"Enthralling mystery that keeps you in suspense right up until the end, and even more suspenseful than the first in the series.",
"Reading, thinking, & reflecting all in one!!",Love the think/relate aspect. I’m able to write my own reflection as I go. Being able to do so makes it more meaningful to me. I also feel as if I can hold myself accountable for my next steps upon reflecting.,
A good scare but not too scary!,"The novel takes you back to Victorian times, with its fascination for Egyptology and mysticism. Good story and well told, in a language that captures the turn of the century to the 1900. Not too heavy, though.A good read!",
The best book ever.,"I love this book , it is very cute and colorful. I read this book to my sister and she loved it. Now I can't get her to read anything else! Barbara Miller you are amazing author and I have to say you have taste in making wonderful story's .",

Steamy and adventurous novel,"Another great novel by Madeline Hunter!  This story is the 2nd in the Wicked trilogy about three brothers.  It is a very steamy and adventurous novel.  Although it seemed to start off a little slow to me, soon caught fire and I couldn't put it down!  I like how we learn more about all three brothers in this book.  I think I'm going to really like reading the Duke's story!In this story, Ives, the younger brother of a Duke, is a lawyer, and is asked by a Padua to defend her father at trial.  However he has already been requested by the Prince Regent to prosecute the case. Ives looks into the case further, and finds there is more involved than it appears, and because he is drawn to her, decides to delve further into the truth behind the accusations.I liked the character development, and the chemistry between the characters.  I like how we can learn to love a character for the very attributes that seem to keep us from liking them at first!",
Five Stars,"wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, thank you",
An appalling book,"The thesis of this book is that the South lost the War because of insufficient nationalism.  To call this argument preposterous is to be kind.  Out of a white population of nine million the South lost a quarter of a million dead and many times that number in wounded.  The South kept fighting until every Southern city was controlled by the Union.  A small agrarian nation, the South fought a large, industrialized nascent world power.  Unbelievably the South came close to winning this unequal contest.  To contend that the South failed because of lack of will is ahistoric and a contemptible insult to the brave rebels who fell under the stars and bars.  A better judge of Southern will during that war was General Grant who, while attacking the Southern cause, admitted that never had men fought harder for a cause than the Southerners.",
Five Stars,Great book. Clearly a lot of time and effort went into this novel.,
Six Stars.....,The best fiction book I've read in many months.And I'm fussy.,
If you liked the movie then reading this book is a must,"I had the movie and book related to it. I bought this thinking I would find new information and it's is truly full of choice info on Nam  I feel it is a great piece for anyone interested about Nam.  I served in The Nam 1967/68 , with the Big Red One , First Infantry Division,. 1st/4th Calvary and was in the first Tet in 1968 I was a M-60 gunner on a Armored personnel Carrier and there is no BS in the book.It's the real deal Also a very good and intesting book to read, Hard to put down and regretted it when I came to the end.

"Great story, pulled me immediately!",I was.literally hooked.within the first.few.pages and then sacrificed sleep to continue reading. I enjoyed the intriquses woven throughout of the murder mystery while beginning to cheer on the heroine created as Katie Freeman.,
The love is evident on every page…both for his wife and St. Martin,"To say that I devoured this book would be an understatement.  I downloaded the Kindle version and read it while laying outside on my porch, all cozied up on the loveseat.  Many times, I was crying or laughing.  What a four-hour journey.From the beginning backstory of Shanie’s fight with cancer you become keenly aware of the love this man has for his wife.  To say that Billy pays attention to detail is putting it mildly! This writer can recall and describe things that make you feel as if you were there seeing what he sees.When he wrote, “She is sporting a black sun hat, black mini dress and black flip flops.  Her smile and sheer enjoyment of her life during this café stop seems to emanate out of her soul.”….I was a goner.  I knew they were kindred spirits to my love of the island of Sint Maarten/St. Martin.That is exactly how I feel after my plane touches down each and every visit.  I am relaxed.  I am at home.  Having visited SXM two to three times a year for over 27 years I know her well.  My heart hurts for what Irma did to so many people and good friends.Given that this was Billy’s first visit to SXM he could have chosen to paint the island in a negative light, especially given the lawlessness and tear in the thin fabric of society that he was witness to.  He did not.  His story is one of community, friendships, and survival.I wish Billy would write an Epilogue!  I became invested in the people he encountered along the way.  Did he ever return to SXM?  Have they stayed in touch with Alain and Martine?  Did they try to salvage anything from the first condo? What became of Joyce, his angel taxi driver?  How did she and her family survive Irma?  So many untold stories.",
Well Done,This book is great on multiple levels. It is a unique prospective on young children's challenges with having alcoholic family members. I highly recommend it for all ages.,
Just read it already!!,"I love Heidi.  She's irreverent, fun, sexy, silly and has a unique view of the world that will make you laugh out loud.  Her life reads like fiction, but you can't make this stuff up!  It's a great ride.",
Painful,"Stephenie Meyer can describe it so perfectly, that you can even feel the pain and the joy of the characters.",
Nice memento book,"This would make a great gift for parents on their child's birthday, and I wish there were more opportunities inside it to use as a scrapbook. The illustrations are beautiful, and there is a fair amount of negative space to allow for adding your own photos or mementos to match the milestones in the book.That being said, it would not go over well as a read-aloud for a 2 year old -- the illustrations and concepts are too complex for a toddler audience. Older siblings might appreciate it, but this is really for a parent audience.I received this book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.",
Not as good as some others,"This wasn't her best book, but it was good.  I thought it was unrealistic -- but then again, it is a romance novel!  I'm really tired of virgin heroine's who have no experience and don't know anything about life and  heros who have slept around and been with dozens of women.  How about some  real world people!",

"Audio CDs for Exploring Medical Language, 8e","I liked that the CD pronounces the words for you. I suggest that anyone can gain some type of knowledge based on if they are working in the medical field or preparing for the medical field. I guess the only disadvantage to the CD is finding the time to listen to it on the go if your car doesn't have a CD player or if you don't own one. I usually listen to it on my laptop while studying so I can hear the words out loud and so that I can pronounce them correctly. I thought it was okay especially since it's a refresher class for me but it would definitely help in other areas of the biology such as A&P, medical term, biology in general because the classes build off of one another. I would definitely recommend if you are having trouble or just want to brush up on some things this would be the CD.",
Not what I expected,"I was expecting more of a historical fiction book. I had a hard time following the Chinese political parties and what their motives were.

Sometime He Wants Them Back,We may encounter over time people who go through a tragedy in their life and may wonder how do they cope?  This book provides an insight into what this family went through when their child was diagnosed with cancer.  It tells how their faith kept them strong and how this faith also helped their son to deal with his disease. After reading this book any parent will feel fortunate to have healthy children and it makes the small trials in life feel unimportant.  It ends by giving parents who are dealing with a smiliar situation a list of suggestions that may help while going through this ordeal.,
Great Read,"For me, this book is the best read of the three books in the &#34;killing&#34; series Mr. O'Reillly has written.  I enjoyed it from the opening chapter until the end.  It kept my attention through out and was hard to put down once you started reading.  Great book!",
Great for Beginners,This is a great word search for beginners. The puzzles only have a few words to search (6 or less) for each one. The book does offer fill in the blank puzzles also where you fill in the blank and then search for the word you used to fill the blank.This would be a nice book for children and adults where they may get overwhelmed with a bunch of words to find.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.,

"Hook, line and sinker!","Wow! That was quite the introduction you started with...War is not pretty and this definitely shines a light on the darker parts of war that nobody wants to hear about. Is it realistic? It seems so but I am no operator. I do, however, enjoy a good read and with this book Jack hits it out of the park. I think I read it in three days and that was taking my time as I could not set it down when I had some time to read.Excellent plot and characters you both love and hate, perfect!Keep up the good work as I look forward to more books in this series and wherever you decide to go.",
Awesome,"This is a fantastic book. Alhough I received an &#34;A&#34; in my college calculus class, I did not feel that I learned the material as well as I should have. It was more of a &#34;memorize the stuff to get a good grade&#34; instead of &#34;learn the material&#34;. So this summer, I decided to study calculus as a whole, both to master the concepts of last semester and to prepare myself for Calc II in the fall. This book is fantastic and challenging. I love it. I cannot stress enough the benefits of learning something intuitively versus memorizing formulas. Get this book. I paid only 15 dollars because I bought it used, and it was WAY BETTER than my textbook.",

unique twist on the bad boy theme....,"Lucifer is ready to retire.  But which one of his three sons is worthy to take over Hell?  Lucifer gives each son a task with success ensuring control of the fiendish empire.  ""Jack"" by Kathleen O'Reilly revolves around Lucifer's oldest son, Jack Vassonovich, and his quest to purchase the Book of Souls.  The lovely Gabriella D'Angelis wants to escape the dreary life of a bookstore owner.  Will Jack complete his task or will he learn to love Gabriella instead?  Kathleen O'Reilly's ability to show any redeemable value in cold-hearted bad boy Jack Vassonovich is incredible.  Jack is more used to the boardroom than the bookstore whereas Gabriella knows that the heart is more important than any dollar amount.  The resulting clash is both sizzling and heart-warming.  ""Nick"" by Julie Kenner is the story of Lucifer's second son, Nicholas Velnias.  Nick is a famous painter but each of his paintings captures a piece of the soul of the model.  His task: to capture the entire soul of Delilah Burnett.  Will Delilah's innate goodness overcome Nick's desire to please his father?  Julie Kenner is an extremely talented author with a gift at creating poignant moments out of some very unusual circumstances.  Her characterizations of Delilah and Nick are captivating and very vivid as one can easily apply their circumstances to other real-life situations.  Julie Kenner maintains the heat level as ""Nick"" is a very sensual story.  Dee Davis concludes this collection with ""Marcus"", the story of Lucifer's youngest son, Marcus Diablo.  Marcus is assigned the task of obtaining an infamous ruby called the Devil's Delight.  He'll have to work with old flame, Celeste Abbot, to locate the ruby.  But what choice will he make if the Devil's Delight is located?  ""Marcus"" is an Indiana Jones style escapade that will delight those who enjoy the combination of steamy romance and high octane action.  Dee Davis produces an excellent modern day historical mystery.  The twists and turns will definitely keep readers on their toes!  HELL WITH THE LADIES is an unusual anthology in that all three stories are intertwined nicely into a much larger story.  Each author contributes a piece of the story and the overall themes are well-managed.  Lucifer, while more of a sympathetic figure than one might expect, still maintains his evil status by assigning each son a task to obtain an object that can be used for great evil.  Kathleen O'Reilly, Julie Kenner, and Dee Davis are to be commended for the superb collaborative effort it took to have such a consistent and smoothly flowing anthology.  HELL WITH THE LADIES is definitely worth reading as it provides a unique twist on the ultimate bad boy theme- the sons of Lucifer!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES",
Lisa does it again!,"You should buy this book and anything else Lisa publishes. So witty, cute, wise and REAL. That's all I have to say.",
Humanity Is Not Doomed,"""Titan"" is a novel about how two astronauts' dream of going to Titan eventually made it possible for life from this solar system to spread throughout the galaxy, but you have to read almost 700 pages of unrelenting pessimism before you get to the payoff.  In describing the book to my brother, I was compelled to point out how the real subtext of this novel is that humanity is doomed.  The book was written in 1996, published in 1997 and describes the adventures of the final crew of the shuttle Discovery during the first fifteen years of the twenty-first century, set against a backdrop of a rapidly declining Earth.The author, Englishman Steven Baxter, gets the development of American society flat wrong.  Disney merges with Coke and forms a monopoly over the web when every other internet provider is shut down.  There is never any doubt that a radically anti-science fundamentalist will be elected President of the United States in 2008.  The U.S. Air Force tries to shoot down America's last manned space mission.  After that, croplands dry up all over the world, segments of the United States secede (but strangely copy the right-wing agenda of the country they're seceding from), and the only really sympathetic character, Apollo veteran Marcus White, is euthanized in his nursing home.Meanwhile, the heroes of the story, Paula Benacerraf and Benjamin Rosenberg, are flying to Titan with three other astronauts who are killed or crippled in nasty ways during or before the landing.  The new President abandons any effort to bring them home so they know they will die on Titan, but they are determined to get some useful science done and broadcast their findings back to Earth.  The focus of the mission changes after a giant bolide propelled by a Chinese nuclear explosion crashes into the Atlantic Ocean: Rosenberg believes their real mission is to store bacterial spores on Titan in a miraculous lake of liquid water, so they will be warmed in billions of years by the expanding sun and evolve into some form of life.  Earth is no longer there to return to even if anyone were interested in bringing them back.This is one novel which I'm glad to say is unfilmable without a complete revision of the plot.  If I were filming this novel I would cast an ex-girlfriend as Paula and her real-life daughter as Paula's daughter Jackie, who is lucky enough to live in Seattle (the Pacific Northwest secedes from the US and becomes New Columbia).  The movie would be about how Marcus White started a space program in New Columbia to build spacecraft capable of retrieving the heroes from Titan and would end with them being rescued at the last second.  The actual ending of the novel beggars belief and is difficult to even describe.  There are lots of better books about the exploration of Titan out there.  Read one of them.",

Great map for the professional,"This map is fantastic--if you're on the road all day every day and need to find every nook and cranny as well as how to get there. This is not the map to get if you just need a regular city map. However for the ambulance driver, utility tech, delivery driver etc, this map is perfect.As far as the first persons complaints--again, they don't waste space with overlap, they keep the same scale on every page--no squeezing the little town into 1 page.You will get used to the page numbers on an everyday basis--they also can be looked up from the front map foldout, find area, look up number and go. It also is used for the CD usage.The roads are easy enough to follow if you note where they leave the previous page...but this is not the ""in-town for a visit"" map.Enjoy!",

Cute book,I've never really been into sugar skulls but then I saw this book. I love dogs and this book looked cute. It is indeed cute and there's a nice variety of breeds to choose from. However I did find it hard to tell the specific breeds. Some are pretty obvious but others you can't really tell.The paper seemed a little thin to me and I'm not sure if markers would bleed through. I've only used pencils.I received this item at a discount for my review.,
Good experience,"Super book, and easy transaction.  Can't wait to begin reading/citing!",
Quick shipping and good story.,"If you like british naval fiction, pick this up.  Get the entire series. Same class with Hornblower, Kent, Ramage and the other stalwarts -- but a lot more fun too.",
Complex characters and intriguing plot,The Trespasser is my favorite of all of French's novels. The novel's characters are fully developed and interesting people. The plot runs in many directions but stays taut and focused. A terrific read.,
Undeniable chemistry!,Two actors who could use a profile boost enter into a staged relationship for the positive press—but is it all positive? I thought this fake dating trope romance would be a breezy and light read but it had a surprising amount of depth and tackled some heavy subjects. I got invested in these characters despite their flaws and their messes (he is her teenage crush and this has some “A Star is Born” vibes) but their chemistry was undeniable and you can’t help but root for them!,

Leave your phone at the door.,"A good and entertaining read, especially relative to some of the other ""canon"" books Lucasfilm has come out with recently. Alexander Freed is a decent author and I think he should be give other opportunities to write SW books. I would have given it 5 stars, but you can tell that Pablo Hidalgo had a hand in shaping this story. There were a lot of ""San Francisco values"" in this book. He seems to be too focused on Twitter while at work, which detracts from the quality of work he puts out. Pablo, you seem to be decently talented, but word of advice brother: leave your phone at the door.",

Could Be My Fav Patterson...,"...and that's saying a lot.  I can see on the surface where the Jester might turn some people (even Patterson diehards) off.  A love story, adventure, mystery all wrapped in the setting of the Crusades?  This is definitely a departure for Patterson and if you go into this expecting Alex Cross I can see where you'd be disappointed.That being said, the Jester has slowly become one of my favorite Patterson novels to date.  I say slowly because I have found that this story has stayed with me much longer than a Cross novel.  This is the type of story that is allowed to stew in your mind and grow with time.  I highly recommend the Jester.Hugh De Luc plays the key role in this novel.  An innkeeper with adventurous ambition, Hugh leaves his family and home to pursue riches in the Crusades.  The Crusade story line does not dominate and should not scare away the casual reader.  The setting merely sets the stage for Hugh's acquisition of a relic that's value is unknown to even him.  Upon Hugh's return home he finds his village in shambles and his family presumably dead.This sets in motion the key storyline of the Jester as Hugh goes in search of those responsible for ruining his life.  A David vs. Goliath revenge story unfolds with Hugh resorting to any means necessary to get close to those responsible for his pain, even resorting to taking up the role of a jester.  Here is able to gain the trust of those responsible and devise a plot worthy of the pain he has endured.  Along the way Hugh gains allies and uncovers truths beyond his imagination.  Patterson's imagery and detail pull you into the story as you root for Hugh in his own personal crusade.Patterson and co-collaberator Andrew Gross tie everything together in a climatic final battle, discovery, and of course a Patterson plot twist.  The plot twist can be seen coming and came as little surprise to me.  While fault could be found in this fact, I still found The Jester well worth the time.  Patterson's trademark rapid pace keeps the pages turning and suspense mounting.",
Fun and entertaining,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered the Callahan Garrity series. I have long been a fan of Mary Kay Andrews but since some of my favorite authors now had some less than stellar early books, I just kept my fingers crossed.  Much to my surprise, I am thoroughly enjoying this series.  I like her characters, the plot twists and turns, the humor and earthiness.  Although some of the language is not politically correct, sadly it is accurate to the times. I am awaiting novels 6, 7, and 8 in the series and have loved 1-5.  Can't wait!For reference (in case you like to read them in order like I do), the 1st is Every Crooked Nanny, the 2nd is To Live and Die in Dixie, the 3rd is Homemade Sin, the 4th is Happy Never After, the 5th is Heart Trouble, the 6th is Strange Brew, the 7th is Midnight Clear, and the 8th is Irish Eyes.  Phew!",
Looks to be as good as advertised!,"I haven't yet read the entirety of this book.  I have merely thumbed through it some and read a few portions.  I tried my hand at egg tanning a couple of hides some months back and when I was researching how to do that, I came across a large number of recommendations for this book, many touting this as required reading for any beginners in tanning.  I have thus far been very impressed and will change my review if after finishing I am any less happy with what I have learned.",
Great resource for chasing waterfalls in North Carolina,"My only regret is that I found this book AFTER visiting North Carolina in October.

Huge book but well made,"This book makes a nice gift edition with the book stored in a box.  I paid a sale price for it so am very pleased with the thick pages, beautiful illustrations and all around quality.The size of the book/box is huge though.  Picture a little bigger than the average desktop tower and you have a good idea of the height.  The width is just slightly shorter.Whether you are reading for the first time or enjoy the classic story, this is definitely one to have in your library in some form.",
"The ""Ah-ha"" moment makes it worth the read!","Such a great book! I love that moment when you figure out how all the stories are connected. Every one is unique but ties together so well.Also, the colors make it a fun visual piece of art too. In my first copy the printing had messed up and part of the color was cut off at the top, so I sent it back for a replacement copy which looks much better.",
As kids' literature it's pretty good,"I haven't really read this closely yet, and don't know if I will. I did breeze through it. It is a good book for kids. I only bought it because my great-nephew is the inspiration for one of the 3 main characters.",
Great Old Bluegrass Songs,"I recently stumbled across this book in a school library.  While the book is quite old, so are the 88 songs, all of which are classic bluegrass tunes.  The melody notes are kept simple, and the chords are given for each song, making it a great book to use for playing in or practicing for jams.  Highlights: many Ralph Stanley songs, interesting anecdotes about bluegrass songs, instruments, and musicians.  Great to have the words to ""Pffftt, You Were Gone,"" made famous on Hee-Haw.",
A MUST have Kipper book!!,I've just started learning Kipper and I'm VERY impressed with this book! What I really like is that the lessons are very informative and easy to follow (just like the author is speaking to you). You will feel like you are being guided step by step throughout the book. Great book! Worth every penny!,
Could be better,"I would have loved to give it five stars, but I expected a lot more from these flashcards than the redundancy and waste of space that I received. It's mediocre at best and unfortunately few products are available outside Nigeria to compete with it. It focuses more so on vowels and not the entire yoruba alphabet, which would have been great. Also, if you are a native speaker, you will come across some words that seem archaic or belonging to a different yoruba-speaking region. Nevertheless, it is a decent teaching tool for kids and non-yoruba speakers.",
Old Material Revisited,"A big disappointment. She kept her very conversational style and a promise of continuation, but there was no real plot, no character development, and even an open question and poor resolution of one of the issues. I've read All her other books so I didn't enjoy this rehash of earlier cases. It was like she had to deliver a new adventure and she didn't have any ideas.",

Assured Independence,"As one of the series about the Greek Village by Sara Alexi, I believe this was the best of all of them! The plight of the illegal immigrant, the maneuvering of the police, the failure of the political system, and the description of the inadequate facilities used to house the immigrants kept me wondering how I was so blessed to be born in the United States. At the same time, Alexi's description of how her main character changed her life to one of independence pleased me beyond words! Juliet found a way to finance her own decisions and helped others around her do so as well with ingenuity and a certain amount of assurance that many older women would have found difficult. I hope to read more books by Sara Alexi.",

The action-packed adventures of a librarian!,"Being a librarian myself, I never thought I'd find a book that fit that particular description.  But Beinhart has managed to weave his mild-mannered librarian hero into a web of political intrigue filled with evil right-wing conspirators and provocative women.  Cudos to the author for making the librarians depicted interesting and sexy (even the one old woman librarian is revealed to have had a very active sex life in her younger days), not the usual stereotypes.  My only small problems with it are that it could have been shorter by about 75 pages, and that the election-based plot is so thinly veiled that he may as well have called the incumbent ""Bush"" instead of ""Scott"".  All in all, though a great read for anyone, not just librarians.",
One of my favorite!,One of my favorite cookbooks. I've gotten it as gifts for others on multiple occasions.,
It was OK Quick read but nothing memorable,It was OKQuick read but nothing memorable,
Worthwhile,"The book has also been published under the title The Penguin Book of Latin American Short Stories. It came out in 1991 and contained 26 works by as many Latin American authors, from seven nations and Puerto Rico. Brazil, with 10 selections, and Argentina, with 5, were by far the most frequently represented countries; the emphasis on Brazil perhaps reflecting one of the compiler's specializations, Portuguese literature. With the exceptions of pieces by the writers Machado de Assis and Quiroga, who were described as the pair marking the start of modern Latin American literature, the book's selections covered the period from the 1940s to 1990, with special focus on the 1970s and 80s.The collection featured old and new voices, the celebrated and the lesser known, and highlighted writers who created unexpected, dreamlike worlds. Some of the works could be regarded as classics: Machado de Assis's ""The Psychiatrist,"" Quiroga's ""The Dead Man,"" Borges' ""The Circular Ruins,"" Cortàzar's ""Axolotl,"" Carpentier's ""Journey Back to the Source,"" Guimarães Rosa's ""The Third Bank of the River"" and Fuentes' ""The Doll Queen.""Other writers were well known - Onetti, Rulfo, García Màrquez -- but their selections differed from the usual ones in other anthologies. There were other celebrated writers - Amado, Bioy Casares, Lispector, Scliar, Allende, Puig, Arenas, Cabrera Infante, Ferré. And then writers who were comparatively lesser known and from Brazil (Armonía Somers, Murilo Rubião, Joao Ubaldo Ribeiro, Lygia Fagundes Telles, Rubem Fonseca, Paulo Emílio Salles Gomes) or Puerto Rico (Ana Lydia Vega). Writers who might be considered comparable in their creation of dreamlike worlds but who didn't make it into this anthology: Asturias, Levinson, Pinera, Arreola, Monterroso, Donoso and Peri Rossi.Some of the stories were written in a minutely described, hallucinatory style and/or seemed merely to pile incident upon incident (Borges, Carpentier, Bioy Cesares, Somers, Puig, Arenas, García Marquez, Rulfo, Cabrera Infante). The one by Cabrera Infante differed from the rest in that it was a humorous parody filled with light-hearted wordplay by the narrator. But many of these stories were nearly unreadable and couldn't be penetrated in any depth. Exceptions for me were works that described the killing of a pig and a participant's revulsion in grotesque and memorable detail (Ribeiro), the shift in consciousness of a narrator who entered a museum (Cortàzar), and a narrator who sought a character from his childhood (Fuentes). These succeeded in drawing me in to their bizarre worlds.Others were told clearly but in a style similar to folk tales or fables and involved extraordinary, larger than life events and/or fantastic characters, such as a psychiatrist who decided to help humanity by building a madhouse in town (Machado de Assis), a father who went to live in a boat on the river and never returned (Guimarães Rosa), a lover who escaped from an angry husband (Amado), a man who found and ""tamed"" a woman (Allende), a magician who could pull tigers out of his sleeves but was worn down by reality (Rubião), and the plagues of Egypt as described by the Egyptians (Scliar).Others were also told in a more or less straightforward and realistic way but created a strong atmosphere of unreality or tension, as in the description of the death of a man (Quiroga), the events surrounding a murder (Onetti), the description of a plot by two characters against a third (Salles Gomes), a female narrator's budding independence from her controlling grandmother (Fagundes Telles), a narrator's description of the menace involved in several relationships, including her own (Vega), and the friendship of two girls at school that crossed racial and class boundaries (Ferré). Fagundes Telles' writing was described by the writer as closer to the psychological precision of French writers from the 1940s and 50s than to the naturalism and regionalism (or magic realism) of her contemporaries, which won her comparisons with Colette.Aside from the classic stories, I appreciated this collection most for the many examples of writing from Brazil, for a number of the more straightforward, well-constructed stories, and one or two of the folk tale-like stories.",
A must-have on your trip to the Big Island,"After reviewing most of the popular guidebooks to the big island, I can say that this one is clearly the best.  Kudos for the authors' attention to detail and objectivity.  Some of the information on restaurants seems innacurate or perhaps outdated.  The condition of some non-paved roads is also somewhat unreliable, specifically the road to Makalawena Beach (what road?!?! its an off-roading expedition).  All in all, the book is an excellent guide for all parts of the island we visited.  The sections on volcano national park and Captain Cook monument give you the locals' scoop.  In many cases, you need to read between the lines to get at the author's real message (eg. viewing lava, etc.)  A must have.  Enjoy your trip!",
A mixed picture of today's Russia,"In Secondhand Time, Svetlana Alexievich paints a mixed picture of post-Soviet Russia.  While an oral history, the author is skilled at threading a common theme of disillusionment, hope, and sacrifice throughout the stories.  I found this book to be particularly effective at explaining what happened in the lead-up to the fall of the Soviet Union, much better than some of my high school and college textbooks did.  This book reads like a collection of well stitched together short stories.  I was quite depressed to finish it, as it was one of the best books I've ever read.",
Lots of keeper recipes,"We got this book a couple of years ago at a local book signing event hosted by a local farm. Before this summer we may have made one or two recipes from it. They were good but we didn't use it that much. However, this summer has been hotter than normal. Trying to avoid the stove and oven as much as possible, we went back to this book and tried some more of the recipes. (Note that many of the recipes call for meat or fish so you can't avoid heating altogether). What we've found is many great and diverse recipes. We've tried four or five in the last month and all have been great as well as quite different.Highly recommended, even if you don't normally think of salads for dinner.",
Great follow-up to Note to Self,"I LOVED Joe Thorn's Note To Self. It is a little book that I've read twice now. If you haven't read it yet, you should, you really should! It's WONDERFUL.Experiencing the Trinity is a follow-up of sorts. Fifty devotionals addressed directly to YOU. Thorn is a big, big believer that believers need the gospel every single day, that believers should 'preach' the gospel to themselves daily. This book does that within the framework of learning about grace and the trinity.It is divided into three sections: God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit. Entries from the first section include: &#34;He is Holy,&#34; &#34;He Is Present,&#34; &#34;He Is Good,&#34; &#34;He Is Love,&#34; &#34;He Forgives,&#34; and &#34;He Is Father.&#34; Entries from the second section include: &#34;His Humanity,&#34; &#34;His Deity,&#34; &#34;His Poverty,&#34; &#34;His Love,&#34; &#34;His Obedience,&#34; &#34;His Suffering,&#34; &#34;His Death,&#34; &#34;His Resurrection,&#34; &#34;His Reign,&#34; and &#34;His Return.&#34; Entries from the third section include: &#34;He Regenerates,&#34; &#34;He Indwells,&#34; &#34;He Intercedes,&#34; &#34;He Comforts,&#34; &#34;He Teaches,&#34; &#34;He Points to Jesus,&#34; &#34;He Sanctifies,&#34; and &#34;He Resurrects.&#34;Each message is rich in scripture and doctrine. And I loved how straight-forward and relevant the messages were.I loved the scriptural focus. I loved how simple and straightforward it was. I loved how relevant it was. But most importantly I recognized how needed it was. These fifty reflections speak truth--needed truths. Thorn's book is a blessing to believers.",

Excellent reference for anyone who deals with transportation security,"On any given day at America's airport terminals, grandmothers are asked to remove their shoes, raise their arms, and submit to a wanding with a magnetometer. That is in stark contrast to commercial transportation security, where even nearly seven years after 9-11, risks far greater than grandma go unchecked.The book Transportation and Cargo Security: Threats and Solutions provides a comprehensive look at the myriad details involved with the complex, dynamic world of commercial transportation security. It includes information on maritime, land (railroad, trucking, mass transit), pipeline, and air transportation modes.The book's 14 chapters provide a thorough overview of the specific topics that cross sectors, such as threats, countermeasures, and personnel concerns, as well as laws, regulations, government agencies, and standards for specific sectors.Many books on these security topics include over-the-top statistics and fail to present a pragmatic view. Transportation and Cargo Security takes a practical yet hardheaded look at the core issues, which gives the reader a superb understanding of the various threats to the transportation system.What is frustrating is that the book often refers to laws passed just after 9-11, yet many agencies and industries are still noncompliant with the many requirements contained in those laws.Transportation and Cargo Security: Threats and Solutions is an excellent reference that anyone who deals with transportation security will find extremely valuable. This is the book that everyone in transportation security should have read.",
Save your money,Didn't need to buy.  Nothing new was learned by purchasing this book.,
Fun Couple Activity,"I have seen books like this in the past but it has always been in the context of writing down things about yourself for your kids to treasure later. I knew that these types of books existed for couples but this is the first one I have seen. I thought it would be a fun thing to do with my wife. There's a lot to like with this little book, but there is some room for improvement too.The idea is simple. The book provides a writing prompt based on a common interest or a past experience. The questions are clearly meant to be discussed or worked through together, unless each has their own copy and they exhange. It's a fun activity either way and it will keep you busy for a little while.The questions tend to be somewhat repetitive in that they are often very similar to others and there usually is not enough room to write everything that needs to be written.This isn't a bad book at all and is fun to work through. It would be better with a little more room to write and more variety in the questions, but it will definitely provide couples another way to connect.",

I was truly disappointed that the book wasn’t longer but Mr. Burnett gets his point of view across in this short profound masterpiece.

Misses the mark,"A novel about a con man being conned. Sounded good but it missed the mark for me although I could tell the author was trying. It's difficult to follow because it's distant third POV and switches time periods (and many of the characters use fake names so they are sometimes hard to keep straight.) There were no real surprises since it's clear fairly early on what's happening and generally why, although the particulars and the how it plays out remains to be discovered. The biggest problem was I did not care about any of the characters. There was nothing that made them individual or alive to me and nothing that kept me interested in what happened to them. By the end of the book I was skimming large sections. Not awful but hard to recommend.",

The deceased detective is found on his fishing boat dead, and his wife suspects murder. She calls on Bosch to investigate his death. Bosch is retired and working as a private detective. His investigation takes him to Las Vegas, Nevada, with a short stop in route. This is where he and Walling begin their search. Is it a murder? Perhaps not. Is it a self? Maybe yes. Bosch and Walling begin their search for the truth in Las Vegas. There they learn a few facts. Walling's FBI supervisor, does not want her getting involved ""personally"". He wants her just to follow him around. However, Walling does go with Bosch. In fact, they go to a small town north of Las Vegas, the only means of income is one bar and several little ""homes"" for prostitutes. Then back to Vegas and L.A. They do find the answer.

This is a great book if you want to learn about finishing wood,I really like Bob Flexner's writing and I enjoy his articles in Popular Woodworking so I decided to order this book since finishing is what I struggle with the most. I have a few other books on finishing but I definitely like this book the best. I really like how he beaks down the process and simplifies it so that I can understand what is necessary and what isn't. And he covers every type of finish and all the pros and cons. There is just the right amount of detail and the table of contents and index are detailed enough that I can use this as a reference book after I finished reading it.,
So glad I have it now,Been waiting to buy this for awhile.  So glad I have it now.  I'm learning from the best.,
Awesome book,Great deal,
Dissapointing,"For me, this book becomes more and more irritating the more I read it.The drawing for tip 94 bares no relationship to the tip. One talks about leg strength while the drawing appears to be about using a wall for club head position. The drawing for tip 97 mentions teeing up on the right side, 'aim for the left' and 'you can now fade the ball', yet the drawing shows the ball flight to the left, surely a draw or hook?Tip 83 ""Bermuda Grain"". ""The more pronounced the grain, the more you'll have to account for it on your read and in your stroke"". Thanks for that.While the drawings are suburb in that Readers Digest 1950's way I am yet to be convinced that they are enough to really clarify the tip sometimes. Golf tips at best are often contradictory and perhaps more than realised, not neccessarily suitable for your type of body mechanics, particularly swing tips.

WOW,"Catherine Coulter never disappoints. Her character s are so believable. After you have read a few FBI  books in her series, you feel like Sherlock, Dillion and Sean are family.  The pace moves right along and I loved the ending.  I won' t even give a hint and don't look ahead, enjoy and let the suspense build.",
Five Stars,"Loved this book, a few of my girlfriends have borrowed it and have loved it as well!!",
Great!,Love it. Short easy to pick up and put down.,
Funny and awesome book,This book opens your eyes up to the legalistic way that some churches bring up children and the confusion that they face when they become adults.  It is written with humor but makes an important point about problem churches.,
Great Book!,"This is a really fun book.  Well-known songs such as London bridge have been given new words to go with the pictures in the book.  There's also a few Thomas songs from the show.  A train lights up in the mirror when you push the button, really cool, and you can sing along with the tune as the lyrics for each are provided!  It even has an on/off button, a nice detail for a book like this.  Tons of fun for you and your Thomas fan!  Takes 3 AAA batteries.",

Workmanlike Western with crossover appeal,"The central character in the novel is ""Dan Stuart"" a prominent(real life)Texas gambler and sporting man who diversifies into boxing promotion and sets out to stage a world heavyweight championship match between the champ ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett and the number one contender Cornishman Bob Fitzsimmons.Corbett,now an overweight ,vain posturing matinee idol retires and so is replaced as contender for the now vacant title by ""Pat Maher""a brawling Irish pugilist of renowned toughness but little skill.The novel---factually based--deals with the multitude of obstacles placed in the way of the promotion taking place.Boxing is illegal in Texas,and civic and religious leaders denounce the plan in press and pulpit.Texas Rangers are brought in to enforce the law declaring they will shoot any fighters who enter the ring for any bouts scheduled on the bill.If this was not bad enough for Stuart a gang of outlaws,lead by the beautiful but devious ""Lea"" are assembled in town with the intention of making away with the gate receiptsHow Stuart deals with the legal and political obstacles is the main theme of the story but as a boxing lover as well as a devotee of the Western it was the boxing bits that mainly engaged my attention and made this novel stand out.Its a good sturdy read with lots of interesting background material on the early years of boxing as a global sport,and the role of the emerging technology of motion pictures and the impact it will make on the sport.Good too to see a less than flattering portrait of the Rangers ,normally seen as stalwart and heroic but here as borderline thugsOne for sports fans as well as the regular coterie of Western devoteesMy one real problem is that its theme'of the ruggedd individualist overcoming all obstacles in turn of the century Texas echoes another Braun novel ""Gentleman Rogue"" and the revisionist portrayal of Western heroes that was a feature of his ""Luke Starbuck""novels is giving way to a more benevolent view of such figuresIs Mr Braun mellowing as he ages I wonderWell worth reading all the same",
Five Stars,Wonderful book that goes into great detail about infantry formations and the changes of tactics over the period.,

Wow,"Quite a story.  This new series pulls in the remnants of the author’s Black Flag series to go along with some new characters.  Lots of twists and turns, and it takes a few pages to figure who are the bad guys and who are the good guys.  Cold War Soviet plot meets current day black ops.  If you like spy action thrillers you’ll love this.",
Action packed.,I really enjoyed reading this book. A crazy amount happens in such a short time. The story and characters were interesting and engaging. I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens next. This one is a must read.,

Very Informative Book,"I found the book 'Mac OS X Tiger: Missing Manual', by David Pogue, to be very informative and detailed, but yet not difficult to read. This large book covers many areas of Mac OS X, and includes sidebar tips & hints, and suggested software downloads. Overall, I found the book to be excellent.",
Michael Crichton at his Worst,"I am a big fan of Michael Crichton's novels and have liked all of them, so it came as a surprise how bad this novel is. The story starts out very interesting like all his work, but after few chapters it goes downhill. Each new chapter gets worst than the previews one. By the end of the book I was hoping for something good to happen, but nothing ever did. I'm still amazed how Michael Crichton put his name on this atrocity. It should have been called Timecrap.Avoid at all costs.",
Great story,I loved the story and will recommend this title in a celebration book I am writing.Hope many will enjoy it as I did.,
Great,Could not put it down. Great story,

An Emotional and Touching Love Story,"Note: This review contains NO spoilersWow! Jojo Moyes has done it again with Louisa's story. How does Louisa deal and cope with the loss of Will Traynor!?! She only had six months with him...six months to fall in love with him and then to lose him...in such a short time.In After You, that is what we, readers, find out. Does Louisa live boldly as Will had wanted her to do. He left her with some financial stability to be able to venture off to be on her own...and out of her family's home. In the beginning, it has been some time since Will's death. We find Louisa struggling with the loss...and not knowing where to g o to next. Louisa is coping, not fairly well, but it is apparent that she is also angry with Will. Several events forces Lou to face her present and future, and to let go of her past.What an emotional rollercoaster ride Jojo Moyes took me as I turned the pages on Louisa Clark's life in After Me. This was a touching telling of Louisa's journey in finding herself again and living again...as Will had wished for her. There were various moments of frustrations, tears, and laughter as Louisa rediscovered herself, found life with new meaning, and opened her heart again for love.If Me Before You captured your hearts with the touching and emotional, and short lived, love story. After You will also give readers another emotional ride with Louisa as she lives boldly.",
Missing 20 pages,The book is missing 20 pages. I bought it new and just now got to reading the book.,
A fun history of Nintendo and the gaming industry at large,"A fun history of Nintendo and the gaming industry at large. Appropriately, the book starts at the beginning with the quick rise of Atari, followed by Nintendo's nascent move into (and early failures in) the US market, followed by its meteoric rise. The author then walks us through the lineage and the evolution of the game consoles both by Nintendo, as well as its competitors: Sega, Sony, and Microsoft (Xbox). Not surprisingly, the Mario theme is threaded throughout the history of Nintendo - it is, after all, arguably the most successful game franchise ever.The book is a mix of business history and reporting, mixed with some humor and author's own commentary, which makes for a light and fun read. You'll get to meet and learn about the life and the creative process of Shigeru Miyamoto, Minoru Arakawa, as well as the main character behind the success of Nintendo - Mario! A fun and an educational read.",

A Must Read,"My Rating: 4/5My Thoughts: What a major cliffhanger twist… was not expecting that one. Stella Gray as always loves to have major twist cliffs endings, and she did not disappoint. Karina lives for freedom and romance. On the other hand, Marco enjoys racing and being a ladies' man. The two meet and sparks immediately fly. This was such a good start to this series.

Best of Archie Comics,"I grew up reading Archie Comics. I would be so excited to read the adventures of Archie and friends (Veronica, Betty, Jughead, Big Moose, Reggie, Miss Grundy, and Mr. Weatherbee). After a while, I stopped collecting the comics and moved on to literature. But the famous comic that started in 1941 is still going strong.While browsing Amazon.com, I came across a new release: The Best of Archie Comics. This was a must have! I immediately purchased a copy. It features the best stories of the past 70 years! It is in full color and designed for both young and old Archie fans. It highlights the eternal love triangle (Archie/Betty/Veronica). It's also a great introduction if you're not familiar with the Riverdale gang because it covers the 1940s to 2010 and beyond. If you look closely, you'll notice the price change. In the 1940s when Archie first began, it only cost ten cents. The comics are categorized by decade with a brief description of the American culture at that time. A history lesson AND memories!As a bonus, it includes comics from the spinoffs like Josie & The Pussycats and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. My only gripe is the spine. I had to bend the spine back further to read some of the pages. A hardcover version would have been better. So I would suggest purchasing two copies: one copy for reading, one copy for the collection.Literary Marie",

A Disney Fan Must Have!,Absolutely love this book!  It is up to date on the latest characters in the Disney/Pixar world.  It has interesting information about the characters.  My two girls love reading through this book!,
Fun sensory activity and super calming,I love these scratch and sketch pages for so many reasons.  I started using them as a sensory activity with some of my students with autism.  After sitting down and doing a page while my students worked on them I realized they were calming for me too!  We all love the colors and the feeling of scratching away the pages.  Ability to draw is not a factor with these because every mark you make creates a neat and unique pattern on the page!  These are well loved in my classroom and at home!,
Highly recommend,"Honest, funny, entrepreneurial. This was also a very easy read, and also gives insight into what it takes to truly build a multi billion dollar company.",

Things are not as they seem in this cerebral thriller,"They say there is only one plot: things are not as they seem. This is certainly the case in Jonathan T. F.

Graeme Henson, released from confinement to unearth details about an al-Qaeda like group for a shadowy intelligence organization based in the US, finds out more that he should.

Poorly bound,"I love Louise Hay, and was really looking forward to using this calendar. The affirmations are perfect. I love the one at the first of each month, that's a nice touch. Also including the month calendar is cool. I pin it to my desk board. But the binding is not well done. As I tear off a page, more and more gets stuck to the adhesive part, and soon it makes the page rip. I had a day by day calendar last year that tore cleanly the whole year. I'll buy that one next year, for sure.",

Awesome resource!!,"I initially checked this book out at the library and just had to have my own copy.  The author has done years of research and provides  very detailed and interesting information about various grains to include their origins, historical uses and various methods of preparation.  There is also a section detailing little-known places where you can order seeds to grow your own or purchase ready to use grains/grain products.  This book should be in every home cookbook collection!",

Custom ornaments and decor!,"I can't believe this book has been out for several months and no one did a review yet! I LOVED ""Patchwork Puzzle Balls"", bought a book on Temari (the threaded balls) and didn't like that one bit. Kimekomi - Japanese for ""tuck in"" - is very cool and fast fun if you're into instant gratification! :) Also called quilt balls, these make fun tree ornaments or bowl/table accents.The short version? Take a smooth foam ball, use a hot knife to cut your crevices/tuck lines, cut little fabric shapes slightly larger than the lined areas, and you guessed it, tuck it in the slit! My first attempts using an exacto knife and a butter knife for tucking came out OK but had the down comforter puffy look.  Do it the ""right"" way with a hot knife and tucking tool and it comes out a thousand times better, neater, and  smooth like the photos.Tool & Supply tips:A ""hot knife"" is basically a not-so-sharp exacto knife tip on either a woodburning tool or the mini craft iron II, you might even have it already if you own either of those tools. Makes a nice, straight and smooth cut in the styrofoam ball. That was a new tool term for me so I went running around looking for something by that name before having a Duh! moment.plasteelcorp sells smooth foam balls, any size will do, just remember bigger=heavier if you're doing Christmas ornaments! Up to 6"" should be fine unless your tree is really wimpy or you go nuts with the glue and ribbons on top! Majority of book patterns call for 3"" balls if you want to be ready when your book arrives.Web search for Kimekomi ""tucking tool"", or ""tucking spatula"" and they are common enough. I got one for $5.50 + S&HI hope you give the book a try, have fun!",=$+
Very disappointed,"My mom bought this book and we were sharing it.  I read it first and now feel like I should give her her money back and tell her not to read it.  Sorry, Mom!If you're as bothered as I was by this book and it's ending in particular I recommend reading the review by egreetham.  Suddenly, my 10th grade Shakespeare class came back to me and I realized that I'd just been dragged through a poorly disguised and badly done rewrite of Hamlet.I enjoyed the author's use of language which was quite beautiful.  But the story itself had too many story lines that went nowhere, foreshadowing that foreshadowed nothing, and chunks of story that seemed to be included for no particular reason.",
Book that finally came.,This book did finally arrive after waiting almost a month for its arrival.  The book fits the purpose of identifying a variety of things in my new state of Florida.,
Most beautiful translation,Steven Mitchell's translation is clear and beautiful.,
"Loved it when I was a kid, and I still love it.","I loved ""Winter Camp"" when I was younger.  It's a great book if you're looking for adventure, and now that I'm older, I can appreciate the way it introduces kids to a different culture.  Toughboy and Sister are the two main characters in the book, and they both learn lessons about who they are, how they're different from the past generations, and how it's not always bad to be able to know traditional and modern ways to do things.  A great book for kids, and I'm sure adults reading it aloud can't help being entertained too.",
Book,Very exciting book,
Great Collection of Sudoku Puzzles!,"I have so far really enjoyed this collection of Sudoku puzzles. I have completed 8 of the easy ones and 8 of the medium ones, and I am definitely going to have fun finishing the book completely. The puzzles are laid out nicely, and the text is easy to read and not too small.I thought it was really cool that this book has a nifty little QR code that can help you figure out whatever puzzle you are working on. When you scan it, you can either choose to see a step-by-step guide to that specific puzzle or the answers. There is also a section in the back that includes the answers.The easy puzzles are perfect for anyone who is new to Sudoku, and the book offers plenty of puzzles to practice with to get you prepared for the medium difficulty. The medium puzzles are great for anyone who is familiar with Sudoku. They are a bit harder than the easy puzzles but not so difficult that you can't figure them out.Keep in mind that these puzzles only range from easy to medium, so if you are looking for more of a challenge, check out the seller's other Sudoku books! If you are just looking for a Sudoku book to relax with, this book is definitely a great option.",
Disappointing,I was so excited to receive this book!  I didn’t open it for days because I wanted just the right quiet evening.  I poured a glass of wine and settled on the couch and then…this??  The photos are of such poor quality I can’t believe Liz let it go out this way.  And they’re often  tiny and cramped beneath the TONS OF TEXT!  I didn’t buy this book for pages of writing about decorating for the seasons!  I wanted to see the plethora of gorgeous seasonal photos I know that she has that made me want to buy this book in the first place.  Most of these aren’t even as good as ones she posts on her blog!  I wanted a picture book of seasonal inspiration and I got 3 minutes from beginning to end before throwing it down in disappointment.  I’m a major fan of this woman’s immense talent but I’m sorry I spent the money.  Where was the editor here???,
Five Stars,Great!,
Thoughtful & Practical,"Transitions of all kinds are tough, complex, and risky. And none of the leaders shepherding such transitions have been trained to develop expertise aimed at effectively negotiating and navigating that risky, complex and tough challenge. This book is a very valuable resource for anyone directly or indirectly involved in leadership transitions.  It is thoughtful, practical, and contains rich and useful insights.",
Pick this one up!,"The opening catches the readers attention as you are transported alongside Viking 1. Pyle's vivid detail flows throughout the work; his passion is almost visible within the pages. A symbolic metaphor opens Chapter 25: ""When one hears the word Phoenix, one usually thinks either of a hot city sweltering in the Arizona sun, a Grammy-winning French rock band, or the mythical bird representing rebirth."" (229). Beautifully written and dangerously accurate. A must read!",
Relaxing Read,I read this book years ago. It's a short and relaxing read.,
Great for the GM on the go!,"This is a great resource to have on the go for your games! I got this book to serve as portable maps for on-the-fly encounters when someone else hosts, or I run at conventions.

Amazing Read!!!,"Definitely one of the best books I've read lately, maybe ever. This was the first Amber Scott novel I've read but I can't wait to read more! I have to admit reading the first few capters I didn't think I would like it. I almost stopped reading but I'm so glad I didn't! I loved Grant, Leigh, Bea & Nick.

I will miss these remarkable women and their families.,
Highly useful information in a well organized format,"Homegrown Harvest is an excellent introduction to starting and maintaining a home garden.  The planting and maintenance information is organized in an easy to follow seasonal format with the different vegetable and fruit families followed from season to season.  The information is presented simply without verbosity.  The photographs are excellent with real garden results - not studio produced ideals.The book gives a mulitude of practical information relating to bringing the food into the kitchen.  For example, the authors point out that broccoli sideshoots can continue to be harvested after the head has been cut, tells you exactly when an apple is ready for harvest and how to store it, to harvest brussel sprouts from the bottom up, etcetera.  The book emphasizes natural means of pest control such as how to build a wasp trap and how to attract natural predators.  The information is sufficient to get a home garden up and running from the ""how to"" to where to get seeds and supplies with sources that cover the United States - but there is an emphasis on northeastern and midwestern suppliers.",
Interesting reading,"I wondered why we hadn't heard much about Mr. O'Keefe for awhile.  I would seem the media avoids any wrongdoing connected with the government (as opposed to American business)and won't air his findings.  And the government......well, read the book.",

amazing  writing!!!!!one million stars!!!!!,"Wow to this comic masterpiece, written pre sandman and cages,  often overlooked because it's a black and white independant... but placed in it's proper historical context this 1990's tome came out of nowhere and changed the scope and power of what an independant company could publish and what a real artist (Francis) and writer (Mack)can do with just ink and paper. One fish, two fish. rEd fIsH, bLUe fiSh. It belongs on the book shelf next to the watchman, the dark knight returns, maus and bone. buy this. It will soon be out of print and the powers that be have sworn it will never be released again. There are mathematical rythems and mystic codes hidden between it's pages.  This is like finding a third album in Sgt. Peppers that no one knows exists. Trancendednt poetry of the inner cosmos and the outer mind.  It should be considered a holy book. buy one and build a shrine.",
Great gift!,I got these books for my grandparents for Christmas. They loved them! We all believe that these will make a great keepsake for us grandkids and cousins to pass down to each other.

Review: P&ugrave;qest Book 1: The Hunter,"I am a huge fan of fantasy fiction featuring new worlds, ideas, adventure and of course, an appropriate splash of magic and romance. Ms. Carez did present a tale suited to just this after I gave up worrying on whether I had the right pronunciation of the language used. I felt my frustration with Ellseyan as her story unfolded and her path crossed with Marsem in an unexpected way, and the family bond and loyalty she shares with her brother. She can be related to by many as she is considered an `outcast' in her family. Despite the small frustrations that I encountered, this story was fast-paced, full of action during fighting scenarios, offers a love story and if one notices, a bit of spiritual enlightenment. I did find myself unable to put the book down as I was anxious to see what would happen next. This tale sets up perfectly for the next book to come in a way as I for one was left in suspense in my desire to know more of the main characters trials to encounter.The down-side of `P&ugrave;qest Book 1: The Hunter"" for me was not that the author created a new world of un-ending possibilities, it was the `created' words (or language) was used often, and a small few were left undefined. A pronunciation key to know how to interpret the words would have helped me, personally to understand how to interpret the words. A handful of sentences had me wondering what was occurring or being expressed. I feel that Ms. Carez may risk others whom could also become confused, or put the tale down and move on. Until I decided just to `flow' with it and read the language without special attention, other than looking in the glossary when necessary, then I was able to get an understanding of what was being told and enjoyed it. As this story is taking place in another world or planet, I personally would have liked a `foreword' or similar to perhaps give us, the readers, a clear understanding (Think of Tolkien and preface for the Lord of the Rings.) of the place, history and time era.",`````

I did not like it,Most of the experiments are not worth it. I believe there's 5% of the book that is worth reading. I do not recommend.,
Wonderful!  Inspiring!,"I actually bought this book directly from the author at a farmer's market.....out of curiosity and wanting to support the small farmer/rancher.  What an amazing, courageous, determined, and inspiring woman!  She had the gumption to move away from a corporate lifestyle that was not fulfilling and jump into the unknown.The book details this shift into bison ranching from a personal viewpoint while providing practical advice to its readers.  It provides visibility into the food service industry that keep this nation fed and alternatives to the mainstream approach of raising, processing, and consuming meat animals.I cannot recommend this book more and am grateful that I had the opportunity to read it!  Wonderful!  Wonderful!  Wonderful!",

Leafing through snippets of 20th century business history,"Economic history or the history of business is often too abstract for the non-specialist reader to take any interest in the subject. This is quite different from the cases of military or art history, for example.Which is why this book is helpful. No one can seriously consider the history of the twentieth century without looking at the vast transformation of businesses and the marketplace which have taken place in this period.The 300-odd pages contain photographs and articles from the New York Times which sweep through major epsiodes of twentieth century business including trust busting, the Great Depression, the electronics revolution, and mega-mergers at the close of the century. The articles are accompanied by commentary from the married couple who are the authors, both of whom have been business writers for the New York Times.Whether you are a student doing research for a high school paper, or a policy maker who wants a quick reminder of the events and forces which have shaped business in this century, you will find this book highly readable and informative. In the introductory words of former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, &quot;Rereading history may never subtitute fully for personal experience in shaping our behavior. But there is something to the admonition of one of the 20th century's leading philosphers, George Santayana, about the importance of understanding the past. And this book surely brings our economic history alive.&quot;",
"great story, bad illustrations","I enjoyed the text of this new American Girl book, but the illustrations were extremely disappointing. The book shares the story of a COVID-era girl dealing with returning to school, her own prejudice, being biracial, racism, and pollution. It does a good job of showing how young people face very serious issues every day, and how they can deal with them and learn together.I really disliked the illustrations because all of the characters looked exactly the same. They were all stick thin with identically shaped faces- girls, boys, old, and young were all depicted with the same bodies. The only differences were hair and skin tone (which is pretty disappointing in a book that deals with racism). The extreme thinness of all the characters doesn't set a very good example for kids reading the book either. It's sad to see a good book brought down by poor illustration choices.",
When the bats appeared,"I first read this book after finding it on the bargain table at my college bookstore.  I have read it several times since then, and have shared it with friends and students.  From the first bizarre line to the last, it was hard to stop laughing.  It is one of the unusual class of novels that truly enables you too look through another man's eyes, distorted as that vision may be.  Admittedly, this is perhaps not for those who have never enjoyed being not sober.  Still, if you are open minded, it is an amusing and enjoyable read.",
Awesome bonding and learning book,Do one or two of these every night with my 3-year old daughter before bedtime. She looks forward to it and is very helpful in teaching her advance topics. Love these books!,
Beautiful pictures,"My six year old son loves hippos which makes the Fiona books a much loved series. These were the first non dinosaur books I was allowed to read more than once.

Worth checking out!,"Good, quick read and nice story.  I got teary a few times, so it definitely moved me.  I've had a moral dilemma myself in the past and I wish I could've come up with a solution like Steph did.  She kept to her principles all the while respecting the business.",
Four Stars,Interesting book,
Literary Disconnect,"The character of Marcelo is interesting by himself. It is kind of neat to get a glimpse of things through his unique perspective. But, that's where the positives end. I don't feel that Marcelo is the best character for this story's plot. It seems as though Stork already had a legal drama story ready to go and tried to push Marcelo in, even though he doesn't fit. I just don't see how Marcelo being autistic adds anything to the story, except validating confusing dialog where I have to step back and map out who is saying what, because the total absence of pronouns, while perhaps characteristic of autism, works against the reader in a literary form. If the story was just about Marcelo living his everyday life, it would be a refreshing change of pace, but putting him into this story creates a convoluted mash-up of under developed plot lines. The story leads you in one direction, only to completely abandon that path and pick up another in the opposite direction. Not like plot twists, but more like following a fly across the room, watching it randomly buzz about without any real direction. Stork sets the story up in one direction and then switches it to irrelevant, tangential plot lines. It is clear from the beginning what the ""result"" of his experience will be. It's almost sad that Marcelo was wasted on this story.",

Poorly executed;  Look elsewhere,"Information in this book is as advertised.  It is indeed a book full of synonyms (even though it can't seem to spell that word correctly). I gave it an extra star since it's free and you get what you pay for.And now I've run out of nice things to say about it.Major Complaint #1:  Layout The lay out starts off like a reference book should; there are appropriately spaced words and page breaks so that everything is organized and legible.  Then about 1% of the way into the A's,  that suddenly stops and you're left with this giant confusing mass of words.  Sure we can tell you words similar to &#34;hoof&#34;, if you can find it!Major complaint #2:  SearchingSearching for something obscure like &#34;addle-pated&#34; will yield good results.  Searching for something like the word &#34;popular&#34; however is going to leave you with a headache.  It takes my ereader four minutes to conjure up 16 entries throughout the book.  Good luck figuring out which is the main entry thanks to the previously mentioned awful layout.  It's going to show you every mention of the word with every conjugation and participle that appears with no distinction as to which is the actual entry for your searched term.Major Complaint #3:  NavigationThere are two way to navigate this book:  The page buttons and the search function.  Why is that bad?  It means that if you  want to look up a word that reoccurs about hundred times throughout the text your only other option is to leaf through each page individually.  That might be fine if your word starts with A or B, but if it's in the bottom half of the alphabet...it'd be quicker to walk around until you don't open WiFi and just Google it.",

An excellent intro resource for 3-string guitar players.,"Answers/info related to questions I wondered about before buying this book:+The book is large format, easy to read, professionally printed, glossy cover, tight binding. The price is reasonable and shipping was lightning fast.+Offers a wide and varied selection of songs from diverse genres.+Tablature diagrams are clear and easy to read and follow.+Full lyrics are provided with chord changes visible above the corresponding words.Virtually anyone can start playing songs they've heard by following the songbook.I would highly recommend it as a 3-string guitar intro, and hope that the authors will be able to produce more books (perhaps intermediate to advanced level and slide tabbed songs) in the future.About me: I've been playing guitar for many years and 3-string for one year. I have purchased virtually every 3-string guitar songbook on the market. Some are very good, some are overly complicated, others are poorly printed. This  3-String Songbook: Intro to Sing and Play Along by Piper & Corps is hands-down the best one I've seen.  I have no affiliation with the authors nor am I ever compensated for writing reviews like this. I just write them when I buy a product I feel strongly enough about - either because I like it or don't like - to share with other folks.",++++
War changes people,I found this to be an educational book. The description of the bravery of the French troops  in Vietnam and  the loyalty  to each other is well presented. Equally interesting the second phase of  war that shows the carryover of behavior acquired under fire  in Vietnam to later stages of life..  The  result is a  decay of  morals towards the &#34;home&#34; citizens in the absence of constant danger.,

Ideas from great thinkers on living life to the fullest,"What a relief to read in these times!  Eric Weiner's ""Socrates Express"" is just what I needed after reading many books about today's existential threats political, geopolitical & environmental.It felt like a ray of hope to revisit via the author's own words, which in and of themselves are a treasure, the thoughts of some great thinkers & philosophers of the ages.  This book  offers the author's fresh insights to a myriad of intellectual philosophies  presented in a completely down to earth style &  structure, a fun read deceptively deep.  It's the author's personal journey & travelogue (mostly by train) that also intrigues & draws the reader in with his authenticity, lightheartedness & obvious desire to share revelations of some of humanity's best thinkers besides Socrates,  from Marcus Aurelius, Epicurus, to Montaigne, Thoreau, Rousseau, Ghandi,  to Weils & Beauvoir among others.  It's a real treat!",
"Very engaging story, well written.",It is a fast read.  Simply written.  It describes dedication and fortitude as a medical clinic is set up in pre-war China.

Do not like to be left hanging,"I did not realize when I bought this that it was 3 books, I do not like it when there is not an end to a story.

Life and Times,"I was recovering from heart surgery when my wife came into the hospital room and told me that Peter Gzowski had died. I started to sob. And hour later the wife of the man in the next bed came in and told him that Peter Gsowski had died. He started to sob. His influence on the Canada of his day was profound. We all thought we knew him. This is a readable and well researched biography of an extraordinary man. It could be called &#34;Life and Times&#34; for the extent to which it covers his work. It works well to portray him as a human and flawed individual. However, it strangely does a much better job of portraying his childhood family - mother in particular - than his wife, children, partners and lovers. In fact, the portrait of his secret lover and the child of that union in the final chapter is better covered than his wife and children. This book is worth the read though like the subject it is an imperfect creation.",
Trip essential,Very detailed and accurate. Makes for easy planning ahead.,
cute loved by all,The book is so cute !,
Informative and well-written,"Extremely well-written book which provides information unavailable in other Jyotish books.  A Thousand Suns isn't the best for mechanics of casting or interpreting a chart, Bloomfield's book is best for that.  But after reading Svoboda, Frawley, Levacy, and Bloomfield, I can say this book is extremely well-written and presents interesting background material you won't find in the other books.  I wish I had read this book BEFORE some of the others as it is more concise.  A Thousand Suns makes plain certain subjects (like house rulership) which were confusing and poorly explained in other books.This book won't serve as a stand-alone if you want the actual mechanics of chart interpretation (Bloomfield wins on that score) but I highly recommend it for the mythological and historic background material which is essential to a deeper understanding for Westerners.  Also, Johnsen's writing style is so clear it will save you hours of trying to understand other writers who explain the same topics, but not as clearly.  I found A Thousand Suns at my local library.  I don't know why it never came-up in the Amazon search engine?  I wish it had so that I might have read it sooner!",
"Reprinted maps are dark, and hard to read.","This reprint of &quot;The 1930 Olmsted-Bartholemew Plan for the Los Angeles Region&quot; is more exactly a low-quality copy.  The maps are so dark they are very difficult to read, and the way they are bound into the  book, much of the details are lost into the seams.  The original maps were  color, so any references to colors in the legends are lost, and the gray  scales blended together make the maps even less articulate. It's important  that a document such as this is reprinted for all to see, but it seems as  if this volume has missed an opportunity of becoming a library keepsake.",
Inadequate all around,"Sadly, this isn't a great resource for Faroe Island knitting.  The history of Hans Debes collecting the charts that were on the brink of being forgotten is interesting and nicely told, but the patterns aren't nicely chosen or done.

"Gasoline, Sparks, and Fire","One of the most thought provoking books I've read in a long time, Scott Berkun's Mindfire is well worth an investment of your time. From the title(based on Emerson's reference to the creative mind as a fire) to the epilogue, the book is filled with essays about topics of interest to any and all readers who are willing to truly ""think"" about where their ideas came from and perhaps even be willing to challenge them. For starters, there's the essay entitled ""How to Be a Free Thinker,"" a personal favorite.The writing is clear, crisp, and easy to understand. As a psychology instructor at a community college, I'm accustomed to reading texts and other types of psychological literature that is often pedantic and ponderous. Berkun's writing is so refreshing juxtaposed to my usual fare! Simple and deep at the same time, the essays provoked my thinking without using a lot of obscure jargon.As a teacher, I'm always on the prowl for ideas to use in my classes, and I found several in Mindfire. For starters, I used this quote as a discussion prompt when covering factors affecting longevity: ""A funny thing about the human mind is that it tends to believe what it wants to believe....We worry about snakes, or getting on airplanes, when the real threats to longevity are cheeseburgers, chocolate shakes and long hours lounging on the couch."" While the text said basically the same way, it didn't carry quite the same punch.All of the essays are fantastic, and I hope to incorporate ideas from them into my courses next semester...and into my thinking for the rest of my life.",
Great Series & I'm Already Reading the Next,"The third installment of this series gives a deeper look at the web of interstellar politics and connectedness going on in the universe and it's all taking place in Armstrong City Dome on the Moon. This one took me a little longer to get into because at the beginning there are points of view from characters unknown & unnamed on planets never heard of and in the past. I felt a bit disconnected and took in the information like one does all info dumps thinking that this is probably important to what's coming but this isn't making it a riveting read by any means. Things improved greatly when Noelle & Miles are back on the scene and it's clear that the story is firmly planted on the Moon. That's kind of what I'm here for. I liked meeting the mayor Arek Soseki and hope he's around for future books (perhaps as the governor-general because he had better foresight than the current one).There was a detailed conspiracy going on concerning Etae and their bid to become part of Earth Alliance that was so multilayered I'm not exactly sure I've got all the details worked out. Suffice it to say, many threads were related and culminated in multiple murders, rioting and some serious terrorist activity that damaged the Dome and killed a bunch of people. The descriptions of that were unsettling. Also in the unsettling category was the way the media & corporate influence played a pivotal role in social sway and political shifts. It was an all too timely reminder of our modern age.As always, Miles & Noelle get the job done in the end but this time they ended a lot farther from one another as the line that is the solitary life of a Retrieval Artist, has been underscored. I'm a little sad about that but I do look forward to seeing how their cases intersect in future books. I'd recommend this one, of course.",

A riveting and inspiring Hero's Journey through a Nairobi slum,"Paul Higdon tells a good story. This non-fiction narrative reads like a novel; I could hardly put it down until I got through the third appendix. But ""Hope and a Future"" actually is a biography. It’s the kind of profile we rarely encounter in literature - a deeply moving narrative whose final chapters have yet to be written. Higdon chronicles the story of a “street boy” coming of age in and around a vast Nairobi shantytown. We meet his family, friends, and many of those who either pulled him up or dragged him down. Yet it’s more than a biography. It’s a well-researched introduction to the social conditions that govern the day-to-day survival of immensely resourceful children in urban Africa. It’s a graphic depiction of dangers and tragedies that relentlessly stalk street children, but it’s also a story of resilience, loyalty and imagination. And if that weren’t enough, it’s a genuine morality tale, a hero’s journey, a depiction of true community in dire circumstances. ""Hope and a Future"" simultaneously entertains, engages, informs and inspires. It also is being used to jump-start an imaginative initiative, Little Boost Press, to help children in situations like the one described in the book. This is Higdon’s first book; let’s hope it’s not his last.",
a delight for any little girl,"Every little girl at one time or other (or all the time, in some cases) believes she is a princess.  Most kids of both genders believe that their parents are sooooo unfair- for instance they make them do chores and eat healthy food.This delightful romp through one such little girl's imagination melds those two concepts into a wonderful fantasy of how her ""real"" parents, the King and Queen, would treat her as befitting her station in life. The tone is perfect, the little girl's attitude is right on, and the illustrations perfectly complement the writing.I highly recommend this to every little girl on the planet.",

However, the story isn't like this at all.  It's a tale of hardship, strength, fortitude, ingenuity, and hope. The story is gripping, and I wanted to get to the end of the book to find out what happens to this very young boy who has been left alone to travel to America to find his brother. Many incidents and many events narrated by the author in this book do not end up positively.  Nonetheless, it is an uplifting story told by a man who persevered through tremendous strife, and he created a life for himself. I highly recommend.",

Very detailed and substantive book,"This book covers the study and history of Interlingua. It explains a lot about languages in general, then goes into more in depth detail about the Romance languages and Latin.I know of two books besides this one which are about Interlingua, and this one by far has the most depth, and is the most intellectual.There are stories which have been translated into Interlingua therefore there should be enough material to keep a beginner busy, and there really should be no need to buy separate books online for reading practice for quite a while.There is an Appendix titled ""Standardization of Grammatical Participles"" which is particularly helpful. And following that is an Interlingua - English  Glossary with the 3248 most frequently used words. And after that is it's counterpart ""English to Interlingua"" Glossary.The book is thick and there is a lot of information crammed into every page.It is a serious read, and somewhat academic.It doesn't have exercises.

"Not a real-life application book, but good for academics","This book is not good for anyone that wants to get into the practical applications of Relational Databases immediately.  This book is geared to people interested in learning the theoretical analysis of Relational Databases stemming from mathematical analysis.  This approach is highly impractical for real-world applications and will remain as conversation material for academics.  This book is frustrating to read since the author constantly makes references to material that is not addressed in this book, illegal use of SQL (utilizing the &quot;#&quot; for illustration purposes) and not indicating clearly how his examples have deviated from the way it is &quot;traditionally done&quot;.  The author is frustrated and spends too much time berating other people's work, and his attempt to explain SQL is poorly illustrated.  This book is mistakenly referred to as the bible of relational databases and the only explanation I can think for this is that it has been around for so long and read by so many people that are endeared by the unreachable tone of his writing, that they assume this is how it should be written.  After seven editions I would expect perfection, and this book is a far cry from it.  Spend your money and desire to understand the theory behind Relational Databases somewhere else.",

"Ultimately, the story was satisfying, but not overly exciting.","I have to honestly say that I didn't truly get into this story until I was about half way through it.  The start was a lot of bouncing around between characters with each new chapter, and what seemed like a lot of back story.  Anne Rice has a way with words, but sometimes ideas can go on a bit too long.That being said, I did like the story.  Once the characters came together, the switching between chapters wasn't so bad, because they were in the same physical place and I didn't have to switch mind frames for whichever character we had switched to.Julie and Ramses have started their life together, but Cleopatra is lingering in their minds.  Where is she?  When will she show up, if at all?  Plus, the two have to concoct a story about Julie's changed eye color for all her friends.  All while traveling and getting ready for their engagement party.  And what a party it was!  The things that happen bring them into contact with more immortals, and they make some new friends in the process.Ultimately, the story was satisfying, but not overly exciting.  I liked the book The Mummy or Ramses the Damned better than this one.",

Best by far,"I waited a long time for this book, finally finding out how everything tied together and how this ""family"" found their forever place.

The storyline and the characters are amazing, how they work together and help each other. There were a lot of hanging threads in the other books leading up to this one and I'm so glad Jeff tied them all together for us in the end. If you haven't read these books, you are missing out on a really awesome story that follows these people from the beginning of this outbreak to the very end.

I am not sure, things are said and I was supposed to understand how we got from point a to point b.  Were the aliens bad or good.

Potential another destruction coming up?  What?Look, I was really taken with the book the first 2/3's of the book.  Good, really interesting, fascinating in spots.  But, when it came time to &#34;tie&#34; everything up, I was not really &#34;getting it.&#34;He also spends [the author not the protagonist] way too much time explaining something in great detail that could have been &#34;explained&#34; in a paragraph.I think of my self as a relatively intelligent person, but there were a lot of things that just made no sense.  And the biggest is that the bad guy's minions just follow along, having a clue but not really concerned with potential end of the world.Trust me there can not possibly be a sequel.  This is definitely a stand alone novel.  This the type of book you read in a group and then discuss, because, trust me on this, there is an endless list of discussions coming from this book.I will read this book again.  But not for a while.  It is worth a read.The problem with detailed explanations is I thought I knew what you were explaining and then you totally lost me.",
Nice Pictures,Hubs and I love music festivals but this book did little to help us find any.  This book is more of a compilation of previous festivals around the world.  I was hoping it was guide to festivals we could still attend but most are a historical account.  If you're into historical accounts of festivals then this book should be very helpful.  I like the pictures as they captured the ambiance of the festivals quite clearly.,
So Funny,"This book has a lot of dad jokes in there. I love that there’s not only jokes, but there is still fun facts! It’s a great read for the young ones.",

Five Stars,Good book,
Love this book.,arrived promptly in the condition described.  Great story.  The library edition is very sturdy and should continue to hold up for many more years.,
Overwrought with analogies and descriptions,"I had high hopes for this read, however, I kick myself for not pulling the plug on this right from the start.  Although I do believe the author has talent, this book goes in too many directions  with no defined purpose.  Each time I thought this must be the story line - diversion.  There is an overuse of song lyrics (author created) throughout the book, which gets old very quickly.  As I stated in my title, this is a book of painful analogies.  I stopped counting how many times the words ""like"" and ""as"" appeared.  The unfortunate part is that the author does appear to have talent in providing interesting descriptions.  Here, however, these were over the top.  The author would be well served by taking a close look at how other proven writers, such as David Sedaris, are able to find a way to provide extremely visual descriptions without seeming to put the word ""like"" in every other sentence.  It takes the reader off the story line.  I found myself eyerolling after the first few chapters.  I forced myself to finish this book, hoping desperately that I would find something (even one thing) truly meaningful.  This was simply not the case.  Here's an analogy for you - it felt like a ride on an attention deficit train (wreck)switching tracks continuously with no destination stop.  Don't waste your time!",

A Stellar Story,"Judy Pierce's tale, along with Silvia Hoefnagel's illustrations, give life to a little girl's dream of being a Princess.  Because this book was published as a fund raiser for the treatment of seriously ill Stacey Mowle, I purchased two copies.  One copy I gave as a gift to my nieces to share with their friends, and the other I kept for myself.Judy's imagination, and her ability to transport us to the magical world of Farlandia, makes this a great adventure for all readers.  It is a delight to follow her story that includes the magnificent Ozette, a singular white squirrel, and all her animal and mythical friends of Farlandia.  Come share in Princess Stacey's Magical Adventure!",
So many flaps!,"What this book lacks in substance it more than makes up for in presentation. There are myriad flaps to find on each page, which gives young readers all kinds of things to look at from one page to the next. Each spread has a paragraph of text that describes what the cat family is doing to prepare for Christmas, including decorating, writing letters, and preparing packages. It’s written as a non-religious approach to Christmas that incorporates Santa and family connection. The book itself is printed on a thick, oversized cover with sturdy board pages inside. The flaps occasionally get stuck or ripped when opened, and there are several typos in the text. Otherwise, it is a fun story for kids who celebrate Christmas and enjoy cats and lift-the-flaps.",

Four Stars,Great for overseas adopted children,
P.G. Wodehouse meets Dr. Who: a complete pleasure,"If you got P.G. Wodehouse to write a Dr. Who script you might come up with something like this. Why not? Apparently as well as script editing for series 17 (featuring, for example, 'City of Death' where John Cleese is an art dealer), Adams wrote a couple of episodes ('The Pirate Planet', and the unfinished 'Shada' which featured none other than Prof. 'Reg' Chronitis and his TARDIS style study). Sorry, enough trainspotting (thanks G &amp; J).The Dr. Who thing only hit me late in the book, but that's partly because 'Dirk Gently' only pops up about half way through, and he's most enjoyably reminiscent of Tom Baker in his distracted purposefulness. I suppose there's something of Ford Prefect there too, and other elements of Hitch Hikers - yet another confused alien species looking to earth as an Eden and changing the deep past and whole evolution of humanity. And I suppose Richard could be played by whoever was DentArthurDent in the TV show.But, hey, this isn't having a go at the book, which is sheer pleasure to read. It's not at all a cheap carbon of earlier Adams, there's just some lovely echoes. The guy just writes so wonderfully - like Wodehouse - and the dialogue is full of good (frightfully British) humour and character. Moreover the comic observations on the everyday are clever and flawlessly executed. The setting is surprisingly coherent when you get down to it (I *love* the way he casually resolves the sofa paradox that's been running through the whole book) - there's really nothing I can think of to complain about with it. I'm used to books lifting me up and then disappointing, but this manages to ebulliently float you along from start to finish.I'm so glad I decided to start rereading books. It must be over a decade since I'd read this and I only had the vaguest recollection of some of the key images. But the chief pleasure of Adams can't be reduced to, say, the plot line, which, while fine, is in one way incidental (i.e. the characters and dialogue are good enough to stand alone). I get the impression he was in a fairly positive state of mind when he wrote this (as opposed to Mostly Harmless), and in excellent form, so these character's are simply pleasant to be with - as well as being hilarious and - as with those of Pratchett on a good day - charming.",
Stickers not precisely cut and/or printed,"[[VIDEOID:e7fc1caa14437d5d2e1760e886e134b6]] Perfectionists beware. I bought one of these sticker by number books at a scholastic book fair for my kids. It was fantastic! The stickers were precisely cut and fit together nicely with not guidelines showing underneath.Then I bought this book. I am very disappointed in the lack of precision that was put into this book. I am fairly good at placing stickers in the correct way. But as you can see from my video, there is no way to get a majority of these stickers to fit in the spaces without overlapping. It ruins the design, it ruins the aesthetic. Wish I could get my money back",
Beautifully done....,This is a beautiful devotional for morning & evening.  It is so well made & looks like hand tooled leather.  It makes a lovely gift & how can you go wrong with Billy Graham!,
EPIC,"The previous book was frustrating because it was boring.  To much philosophizing, although I do enjoy that aspect of Bakker's writing, there was far too much of nothing. Very little happened in the previous book except for Achamian's storyline and that was only at the end.Not so with this book.  Epic.  Loved it.  If you have liked any of these 5 books, you should have no problem loving this book.  It has everything that has made this a unique and interesting fantasy series. Act 3 is as good as anything I've read.  All three story lines were epic.  The Great Ordeal-epic battles, struggles (internal and external), death, dust, despair.  Kellhus was far more interesting, though not in much of the story.  Esmenet - far far far more interesting story line with her, her insane children, Maithanet and the capital. Achamian-the best of all three.  Interesting the entire way with an (word overuse warning) EPIC ending.  Loved this book. Enjoyed every moment.",
Trilogy,"This is the last book in a trilogy written by Joe Johnston and produced by the Missouri History Museum.  The writing is lively and engaging, enticing the reader to turn the next page to learn what happened.  The first book is on a single subject, and it did slow down about two-thirds of the way through, but the next two deal with various vigilante groups and criminals and how they came to be.  Wander across the Ozarks from Springfield through the Irish Wilderness to the Bootheel.  You can see how easy it would be 150 years ago to hide out in Lynn Creek or Pilot Knob.  You'll learn about the Border Wars, the Bushwhackers, the Baldknobbers, and the Regulators.  These ruthlessly researched books deliver the facts, along with what might be some speculation as to motive of the characters, but they illuminate for me the early days of Missouri.",

I lost a son 6 weeks ago and as I read this book, I just found myself shaking my head yes, yes! through all the pages. I could not have written my feelings better myself.

REAL Advice from REAL Professionals,"I have every single page of this book starred for later reference in Google Reader, straight from the authors' website at [...]. I've read it all before, some of it multiple times.So why did I buy the book? Because it is full of absolutely invaluable advice for any writer on the planet (and most that aren't), whether they be aspiring, amateur or professional. It was essential to me to have this in book format, so I could hold all that knowledge in my own hands. (Plus - it's easier to cuddle up with than my laptop!)From brainstorming to plotting to characters to querying to marketing (and more!), this book covers every aspect of a writer's journey told in complete honesty from professionals of the speculative fiction genre. I've read a lot of so-called how-to articles for and from writers.A. LOT.This book (& website) are among the top 3 in terms of helpfulness that I've found, ever. And I have been searching for a very long time. These authors aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves and show you how it's done - no vague references to ""finding your voice"" here (although that topic is covered). These are actual, step-by-step how-to ""this is what worked for me"" articles from commercially published authors (and an occasional editor).If you're serious about writing, you'd be a fool not to buy this book. But don't take it from me. Head over to Magical Words (.net!) and see for yourself!",
"Obnoxious, self-aggrandising, and questionable.","While a newcomer to gardening, I'm reading this in parallel with several other books which contain more detailed and accurate information, presented more elegantly, by vastly more likeable authors.Mel's particular blend of arrogance, bombastic poor taste and self promotion makes reading this book about as enjoyable as the captions on a late night infomercial - and for most of the same reasons. There are many other more enjoyable and informative books about intensive home gardening, and gardening in general; the popularity of this one appears to be due to the author's unceasing appetite for self-promotion, and his willingness to cater to the lowest common denominator in doing so.If you're not particularly discerning, don't have high standards, and are happy to sit through the odd TV infomercial, the tone of this book is targeted directly at you. Don't let me put you off; enjoy the planet. If you already own a few books on gardening, are just looking to pick up a few useful tips or a different perspective, you're prepared to take what Mel says with a grain of salt, and you can stand his company, you also might enjoy this one. If, on the other hand, you're looking for an informative, enjoyable tour of urban gardening, written out of a compulsion to serve your own best interests rather than those of the person who wrote it, I urge you to look elsewhere.",
Interesting,I thought it gave quite an insight into Edwards point of view. You can almost imagine how he would have felt in the other three books. It also gives way more background to the other Cullens which is refreshing.I would recommend reading at least Twilight and New Moon before reading this accompanying novel to the Twilight series.,
Not Fun.,Probably the least clever Bruce book in the bunch. Not as much fun to read as the others.,
More Editorial Notes,"Performing The Goat - A Collection Of One Act Plays is gradually proving itself as a fresh and entertaining resource for actors and theatre groups. Its success speaks for itself in festivals and acting classes. The collection of one act plays contained in Performing The Goat has proven successful for on stage productions in standalone events.Kyneton Theatre Company in the north west of Victoria (Australia) performed Fergus' Envy and Champagne Ladies during the 49th Kyneton Daffodil and Arts Festival in 2005. The two scripts individually won, the Adjudicator Award for Best New Play; winning two cash prizes.Scone Acting Dramatic Society (SCADS) in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales (Australia) performed The Mechanics from Performing The Goat in May and June 2007 during the Scone Horse and Arts Festival. Its success and audience appreciation was proven by full houses to ten performances.Performing The Goat remains a great inspiration to actors and theatre groups looking for something original and fresh. The Millfield Theatre's acting class (London) used Fergus' Envy and Champagne Ladies contained in Performing The Goat. The response from their students was that of great joy and success. To quote: ""They (the scripts) were the hit of Millfield last night..."" relating to the actor's enjoyment from using fresh scripted ideas.",
"Great writing, not great story telling","The painting, The Goldfinch, was on display at The Frick this past winter which fueled the intrigue surrounding this novel.  Additionally, many friends of mine were reading this novel over the winter and one gave me a copy as a gift.  I was immediately captivated, as it begins in the city I love most and in a neighborhood I frequent.  I did, however, find it to be too long winded.  Parts of the story in the latter third of the novel became quite boring and disjointed, but I continued to read hoping for some sort of cohesive ending which never came. This, along with the fact that I could never conjure the main character (I never truly had a picture of him in my mind's eye) results in my lackluster rating.",

Again, not just a read, but components and definitions that empowered me.  And exercises to keep me strong in my own understanding. I have re-read the book a couples of times already.",

Romanov has it all.Nadine Brandes made me fall in love with historical fantasy with Fawkes, her last novel that puts a colorful twist on the Gunpowder plot. Of course I was eager to see what rich details and plot twists Romanov, just released May 7, would hold.I was not disappointed.Things I loved:Getting to know the deeply loyal and caring Romanov family. Nadine drew from real facts about Tsar Nicolas and his family. Watching them interact kindly with their revolutionist enemies while in exile was beautiful.Anastasia(Nastya) Romanov is a delightful, impish, and clever main character. I loved her from the start.Russian culture details--fascinating to see the background of the story come forward at times and take me to a land I've never visited. I was never bored.Nastya's character growth throughout the story was an inspiration.Things I didn't love:Umm...The only thing I can think of was that a few times the characters' motivations for doing certain things wasn't completely believable. But I know that each reader is different, so this is probably simply because of my personality.All together, I highly recommend this book!",

"Short, truthful, clear and easy way to learn about JGH",The book tells well the story for JGH,
essence of religion,"This book is the reason that Sam Harris has always been my favorite of the New Atheists. He recognizes and practices what I always called the essence of religion. Stated simply, if you meditate, pray, fast, ingest certain substances, you can experience self-transcendence. Most of the major religions have a name for this experience... enlightenment, nirvana, satori, samadhi, state of grace. The beauty of Sam's book is that he cuts through the trappings of religious dogma and new age mysticism that tend to cloud the experience. This is especially an important book for those unfamiliar with this phenomenon, and can hopefully lead some to a path of self discovery. As more of us learn to quiet the ego, this will become a much better world.",
Most frequently used cook book I own,"About four or five years ago I took a couple of hour class from the author, Suvir Saran, at Sur La Table in Portland, Oregon.  Since then I've made 35 recipes out of ""Indian Home Cooking"" - which may not seem like a lot, but when you consider that I eat out more than 50% of the time and I don't think I've made more than 10 recipes from any other cook book I have ever owned - not to mention that there are a few of the recipes that I like so much that I tend to make them repeatedly (grape raita, stir fried green beans with coconut, stir-fried carrots with cumin and lime, coconut chicken with cashews, ground turkey with spinach and whole spices, and mangalore fried shrimp), 35 recipes actually is pretty good!  Tonight I made three that I hadn't tried before:  the red kidney beans with ginger, tomato and curry leaves; green chutney; and onion pachadi.  As usual they were all wonderful - although I probably didn't pick the best complements since all three have lots of onions in them.  I'm hoping to try another 30 recipes in this book by the end of the year.  Making things from this cookbook is one of my favorite simple pleasures in life, particularly when we have friends over to share the deliciousness.Before Suvir Saran introduced me to Indian cooking, I was intimidated by it.  While I loved going out for Indian food, there were such varied and unrecognizable flavors to me that I couldn't even imagine how the dishes were made.  Yet, once I started making Saran's easy-to-follow recipes I found that it really isn't difficult at all.  In fact, I now understand the basic cooking techniques and spices well enough that I can look in my refrigerator to see what ingredients I have and then improv something using Indian spices and cooking techniques and end up with something that tastes great.I'm not a vegetarian and have always felt sorry for my vegetarian friends because of how much they were missing out on the flavors and variety of an omnivore diet.  In fact, often when I ate vegetarian meals in the past I felt unsatisfied.  Yet, if I were to cook out of ""Indian Home Cooking"" every day, I could easily be a vegetarian and not feel like I was missing out on anything.  The flavors are varied and interesting enough that I don't feel the need to necessarily include meat dishes in meals.  When I do cook an Indian meal, frequently the meat dishes are a small part of the meal, rather than the focal point.  I guess what I'm saying is that when I cook out of ""Indian Home Cooking"" I tend to eat more vegetables and less meat - which is a far healthier diet.  If I could only keep one cook book of any type of cuisine, ""Indian Home Cooking"" would be it.",

The  Last Days of the Tavern,"_Callahan's Secret_ (1986) is the third collection of stories about Callahan's crosstime saloon. In an introduction, Robinson stated that this would probably be the last of the Callahan books. It wasn't. But I think that it is fair to say that the later stories were \""second cycle Callahan tales.\"" A number of things come to and end in this collection. There are four stories in the collection, all novelettes from _Analog_: \""The Blacksmith's Tale,\"" \""Pyotyr's Story,\"" \""Involuntary Man's Laughter,\"" and \""The Mick of Time.\"" A comparison between these tales and the stories in the first collection, _Callahan's Crosstime Salooon_ (1977), shows a marked difference. The later stories are more skillfully plotted, more smoothly written, and a bit more bawdy. Also, the jokes, tall tales, and puns are-- if you can believe it-- more clever and outrageous. We sometimes have a tendency to underrate humorous fiction. Great fiction must be serious and solemn. Humerous fiction can be _good_, you understand. But not great. We forget that doing humor really well can be deucedly hard. In any event, I am giving top rating for these stories. They are some of the best of the Callahan's Place stories. They are great fun and great writing."", ""images"": [], ""asin"": ""0812572297"", ""parent_asin"": ""0812572297"", ""user_id"": ""AFKQOH5UOFIZUE4R5ITELBUZ6HJA"", ""timestamp"": 1197534903000, ""helpful_vote"": 8, ""verified_purchase"": false}

An utterly delectable and totally addictive New Adult romance,"BOOMERANG is an utterly delectable, incredibly exciting and totally addictive story that is the perfect blend of sexy and sweet. Told from both Mia and Ethan’s perspectives, this story will keep those pages turning as things between them go from awkward to competitive with an undercurrent of tension that sizzles.Waking from what should have been an unforgettable night that neither can quite remember, Mia and Ethan soon learn that their one-night hookup was not the last they would see of one another. When it turns out that they’re both vying for the same job, they’ll have to decide what’s more important – the chance at an amazing opportunity with Boomerang or the possibility of seeing whether the connection they have could lead to something more.The authors crafted a novel with two very likable characters whose chemistry is electric, whose predicament makes for a story that is at times angst-filled, at others swoonworthy, and whose happily ever after readers will very much hope for. They don’t skimp on character development - readers will get to know and adore both Mia and Ethan, with all their flaws, insecurities and hang-ups, and they’ll get a peek at one of the central characters in the next book in the series.As things heat up both on the job and off, more will be revealed about past relationships, current desires, how they met, and what landing the job at Boomerang really means to each of them. Their story is captivating and romantic, a touch suspenseful and a little bit heartbreaking. It’s a story that will be unputdownable.From the competition, to Mia and Ethan’s undeniable attraction, to the head-meets-desk decisions, to the questions about what exactly happened that first night, BOOMERANG is a quick, nail-biting and wildly entertaining read. It’s a fantastic start to this series that is not to be missed by fans of this genre or readers who like clever and engaging stories with just the right amount of heat, sexual tension and romance.",

Great!,"This is a an outstanding book, which in this readers opinion was clearly not created to be a concise and detailed history.  The subjects covered would take multiple volumes to do so.  It does however, briefly cover multiple events in which America took a pivotal role.  Whether we like it or not, we have perpetrated irreparable damage to the environment with nuclear testing in areas in the Pacific.  Its upsetting to think that native peoples were permanently displaced, for all time from their ancestral island homes.  I'd recommend this book enthusiastically to anyone interested in our far reach and as perhaps an introduction to more detailed reading on the many subjects mentioned in this book.",
I almost put it down ...,"I'm not sure the last time I read a book where I was tempted to stop reading and throw it away ... but I was sorely tempted with ""The Pirate"". The main character, Alex Hawke, is completely and utterly unbelievable, the situations which he and his friends get into and - miraculously - get out of border on the ridiculous, the writing cliched, etc. Moreover, the book is riddled with factual inaccuracies in places where the inaccuracies were not needed for the story. Where were the editors??",

Christmas stories!,"This book was so good! It’s a Christmas theme book, so it will definitely be a book you’ll want to read to get you in the mood for the holiday.Sarah M. Eden’s was a great way to start off the book! We get to see a glimpse as to what Lucas, Julia and young Adam are up to while getting to meet Nurse Robbie! I was so excited to finally get to learn more about the famous Nurse Robbie who helped raised Adam. Like most of Sarah’s books your emotions are on a roller coaster ride. I loved making connections to the Jonquils/Lancasters series in this book.Esther Hatch’s novella  had me laughing from the get go. It’s an enemies to lovers story, so if you like that then you’ll definitely love this one. The characters are amazing, but I personally think the grandmother stole the show. She was a riot and so good at playing matchmaker. I wished this one was a little longer because I wanted to see a few things before it ended but that’s just me.Dana LeCheminant’s novella  was one of my favorites from this book. This is my second story by her and I’ve vowed to read all the other books she has written. It was easy to see how this story was going to end but I was more than happy to read the whole thing. Graham and Beth were so much fun to read about! I wish it was longer because I needed more of their story!Anneka Walker’s novella was such a good way to end this book! The way this story started had me dying! Thomas’s sense of humor was so good. And Alice was such a good leading lady to not hold what happens at the beginning against Thomas.  I loved seeing Alice and Thomas grow as an individual and unknowingly as a couple. The ending was great! Bless Alice’s grandmother for saving day.",
Looks promising,I purchased this as gift for grandson who likes history & aspires to be an entrepreneur. I’m hoping he will enjoy it.,

too much notes/highlighting,"Got delivery promptly which is good, but the condition is poor.  Understand this is used one but did not expect that heavy notes and highlighting within the book",
Difficult and Frustrating.,"I am amused by the professors who rate this book so highly; have you ever followed up with those to whom you recommended the book?While working through this text for a distance education course, I am finding it a difficult and presumptuous book which introduces concepts and formulas without any explanation as to what the parts mean. Seemingly from out of nowhere, numbers are thrown into formulas without explanation of their meaning or even where they come from. The end of chapter questions are of extreme difficutly at times, trying to trick and outsmart you rather than re-enforcing concepts. Expectation of previous knowledge of the workings of financial concepts and markets make parts of this text impossible to understand without outside help.For an introductory text, this one does an extremely poor job of explaining the concepts. From the perspective of a student and not a professor to whom these concepts should be elementary, this is a difficult and poorly geared text that is nowhere near ""high-school level.""",
Charming preteen mystery,"Sharon Shaefer was my sister in law for over 45 years.  She died recently after a valiant fight with an unexpected illness in the presence of us and much of her family.  So I am not totally unbiased.  I had hoped to hear her voice through the pages of this book.  That didn't really happen for me, but it may have for others.  That being said it is a charming book lovingly edited by her friends.  It is reminiscent of books I loved as a young girl and I'm sure she did as well.",
The most important link to GD,"This translation is the best, the most authentic  and the most true to the names of the Almighty GD.

An Excellent Addition to the Snowmen series....Love! Love!,"Ah Ha...brilliant!  A Snowman story we can read all year long.

"No damage,great price !",Great quality for what I paid for!,
Great book!,"My son is in the fifth grade and just finished reading this book.  When we start a new book we usually read it together at first to get in to it quicker, discuss the book, and make sure he's in to the story before he goes off on his own.  However with this book I found myself grabbing it when he got home from school to catch up on what he read during the day and we'd read it together at night.  What a great book with a lot of life lessons.  This might be my favorite book of 5th grade year.",
A cognitive scientist's rant about politics,"I was disappointed with this book.I was hoping for a book full of solid cognitive science, offering readers insights in order to make their own judgements and to better understand politics. Instead, the book felt like a rant about politics; a rant which just happens to be written by a cognitive scientist. Many studies are mentioned, but little detail is provided (though, the author does include references), and the discussion feels very much like hand-waving. I don't doubt the author's own credentials, but he leaves little opportunity for the reader to reach their own conclusions.I therefore found the political discussion unconvincing and cheesy (this may have also have been in part because I am not an American and the book is very US-centric).However, the book was not a complete waste of my time -- I did enjoy reading it as it offered a way of thinking about discourse in terms of framing and metaphors.",
One of my all time favorites,"I kept hearing about this book, and finally read it at the beginning of this year. I ended up staying up all night reading it! It's true what some detractors say about them acting like children in a professional work environment. It gets pretty established though that the work environment is hostile in a lot of ways, since it was a merger of two very different companies with opposing views on the world of publishing. The co-CEO is a blatant sexist. The main character Lucy acknowledges that she's not proud of her behavior, and you get the sense her nemesis Josh never has been proud of it either. He says as much actually. People aren't perfect. We find out that Lucy's childishness is due to just being plain lonely and homesick and wanting attention from the only person she interacts with day in and day out. She's smart and quirky and witty, with lots of attitude. I loved seeing the layers of Josh peeling away as well throughout the book, and learning why he acts the way he does. The way they banter and flirt is amazing, and seeing their relationship develop was so rewarding, paying off with one of the sweetest and hottest love scenes I've read since Chapter 55 of ACOMAF. These are two complex, imperfect people that are perfect for each other, challenge each other, and come to understand each other on a soul deep level. I loved it so much.",
"CHILLING SUSPENSE, FINE AS A STAND ALONE TOO","VANISH is part 5 in the Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles series. However I read it as a stand alone and did just fine, so I can recommend it that way too. I'd also never heard of author Tess Gerritsen before this but will definitely be searching out more from her and this series. I loved her style of writing, the realistic characters, the suspenseful medical based plot and the fast moving thrill of this story as a whole. There were elements that you could tell if you were invested in the series (and reading it in order) would have been even better or funnier or sadder however I never felt lost or left out of some big plot due to the excellent story telling. This is crime writing suspense at its very best.Vanish pulls you in from the very first page starting with Mila's heartbreaking story of human trafficking. She and a group of Russian girls are crossing into America from Mexico having been lured there by the promise of a better life however by the end of the chapter one of the girls is dead and Mila has been sold into a prostitution ring. Mila's story (which we keep flashing back to) is gritty and often hard to read probably because it is very real.We then switch to coroner Maura Isles who is going about her daily routine (in vivid medical detail) when she discovers that one of the bodies in the morgue is still alive. ""Jane Doe"" is rushed to the emergency room where we meet up with our other protagonist Detective Jane Rizzoli who has just gone into labour following a take down at the courthouse (she rocks)Through a fantastic series of events that kept me on the edge of my seat and never able to guess what was coming next, the formerly ""dead"" woman grabs a security guards gun and takes 6 people hostage in the hospital, one of which is Detective Rizzoli. ""Jane Doe"" won't talk to the police negotiator and we only learn her motives after a man disguised as member of the SWAT team joins her. His story is equally enthralling.This tense drama plays out for a large part of the book bringing in a host of other characters (and their POV'S) along with clever plot twists and exciting action. All of which Gerritsen manages to tie together. We meet Jane's husband FBI agent Gabriel Dean (I'm assuming we met him in earlier books) we also have Jane's partner (hints of a love triangle), reporters, spies and bad guys in Washington. We get crime scene investigations and the makings of a political thriller which thankfully doesn't take over and a very realistic story involving a new mother trying to get to know her baby while maintaining her identity. Throughout it all we keep coming back to Mila and her story is the one that haunts me.What a fantastic unputdownable read. Not my usual fare but a series I will definitely be coming back to. Cheers.",
Beautifully written.,This is such a beatifully written book. Sometimes you want to read a book just for the writing style.This is one of those books. Highly recommended!,
Coloring and Learning,"This coloring book is great for all ages! The pictures are bold and fun to color! The book starts up great discussions on God, the Bible, and the other characters that are a large part of Gods word!",
One of Seton's best,"This novel has so much to offer. It tells the story of the relatively unknown Winthrop family -- specifically Elizabeth Winthrop. The novel is long but you'll find yourself wanting even more at the end. Seton takes her time, describing the girl's life growing up in England, her voyage across seas to a new land, and her adult life in Massachusetts and Connecticut. It is a fascinating story and once again, Seton does an immense amount of research that makes the novel even more enjoyable to read. I certainly recommend it for anyone from the New England area, as the Winthrops were quite a prominent family in the 17th century. One of Seton's best.",

Be Ready To Spend Some Time Cooking,"This cookbook works to ensure your access authentic Indian recipes! Richa does a wonderful job explaining different ingredients as well as cooking methods.  I also like that most recipes have alternatives written into them, so you don’t have to google a replacement.  As with most great home cooking, the recipes I’ve tried do take some time, but they are worth it! The pictures are also a wonderful motivator for what your food could (and probably will) look like. I love that this book helps keep so much diversity in my diet, as well as teaches me about Indian culture through cuisine. Definitely buy if you love Indian food, vegan food, or cooking in general!",
My kids teachers loved these,Cute!,
A Miraculous Journey,"Imagine healing from the atrocities of war without punishment, prisons, or revenge. Imagine demonstrating a new way of being, based on the strength and wholeness of individuals and communities. Imagine working with impoverished villages devastated by war and Ebola, where those remaining are not seen as victims, but are seen as creative leaders with the power to rebuild their devastated communities.This book describes a journey of healing for the author and the leaders of the Fambol Tok movement, and how together they rebuilt Sierra Leone, village by village. As the story progresses, the villages heal and transform, and the author and her partners also transform in some beautiful ways.The book gets a bit rambly in places, but delivers a powerful message. It shows us what humans are capable of, when given the opportunity to organize themselves for the common good. It shows that traditional humanitarian aid, no matter how well intentioned, often prevents communities from organizing and getting what they truly need. Readers will find new ways of looking at the world, and great hope for humanity in this unique and highly engaging book.",
disappointing let down,"After reading and adoring Tam Lin, I rushed out to buy Juniper, Gentian, &amp; Rosemary, but after the first few chapters I was bewildered, and finished the book out of duty, hoping it would take off.  The literary  references in Tam Lin inspired me to check out things I meant to read in  college but never got around to, where as the references in Juniper,  Gentian, &amp; Rosemary just seemed pretentious.  ( I guess one expects  references from a university crowd, but not from young high school  students)  I kept waiting for something intriguing to happen, some element  of Faerie, but when it revealed itself I was alternately relieved that I  had finished the book, and disappointed that there was nothing more.",
Pacifists that got people killed.,"While this book is informative, the author takes great pains to both credit the anti-warriors with helping to end the war, but basically absolve them of any responsibility for causing the Vietnam War to continue and kill more Vietnamese and Americans.  They emboldened the North Vietnamese to continue on, end of story.Anyone who knows history knows that the North Vietnamese attacked American where it would hurt most, that is, the court of public opinion back home.  They knew from their experience with the French that no matter the cost, the population of a democratic government will inevitably cause that government to end its participation in a war, no matter how noble the cause seems.Too bad we’ll never know how many people the anti-warriors killed.",

"Not what I was looking for, but okay.","I am sure for some this will be great. For me, it was a bit too fur-fru with the recipes. It did give a lot of good advice on cooking pans that are needed.",
Glad I finally read it - Should have read it sooner!,"I finally read this book right before the movie came out. I admit that this book had been sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust. I also admit to enjoying the Twilight books, so I was not opposed to Ms. Meyer's writing or style. But I'm not a huge Sci-Fi person, and the premise of this book just did not appeal to me, despite having friends tell me how much they liked it. So I procrastinated...and procrastinated...and procrastinated. It took the movie and a Stephenie Meyer event I attended to kick me in the butt and move it up my reading pile. And once I read it, what do I have to say now?I LOVED IT! This was one of those books where I just shook my heads and thought to myself, ""What took me so long?"" This was a beautifully written book, exposing the many layers of love and humanity. The size of the book is intimidating, and it starts a bit slowly. But I found reading it worth the time and for me the reading process quickly sped up as I became more and more engaged and invested with the characters and plot. I found the plot unique and engaging, the character development well fleshed-out, the multi-layers of love development thoughtful, and the analysis of real humanity beautifully examined.I also admit to not being a fan of love triangles. They tend to be exhausting, unrealistic, selfish, and overly dramatic. But what I loved about this story is that it really wasn't a love triangle, not in the simplistic sense of the term. I don't want to spoil the plot, but I found the whole thought process and relationship between Melanie and Wanderer fascinating. I really found their relationship the most engaging. Then with a love interest or two thrown in there, and the confusion over two minds sharing one body, the plot really thickened, but again, with an imaginative process. And the love discussed wasn't limited to just romantic love - there's also friendship, family, forgiveness, camaraderie, community, sacrifice, and many levels of love in between these. This is one of the things and subjects I was most impressed with in this novel.Bottomline: I loved this book and added it as one of my favorites. I have also listened to the audiobook (because I needed to read/hear the book twice in a row, it was so good), and found the narrator quite engaging, so if you'd prefer the audio-version over text, I highly recommend it. This is one of those books you don't want to pre-judge. Perhaps you disliked Twilight, perhaps you hate love triangles, or perhaps you have an aversion to Sci-Fi. I would still recommend giving this book a chance. I'm glad I did.",
I couldn't put it down!,"Once I started this amazing book, I couldn't put it down. I am not a ""horse person"", but Melissa made me understand the special bond between horse and rider. As other reviewers have commented, it was a book that really resonated during this time of divisiveness. It made me remember that the power of human kindness transcends politics. Plus, there is the added bonus of a wonderful dog and mule!",

"Give it a chance!!! You'll like it, I'm sure of it =)","Okay, so I wasn't that thrilled with the first two chapters...I thought they were pretty boring, and I just couldn't get into them. BUT, as I continued reading,  slowly but surely,  the characters developed, and so  did my interest in the book. The soliloquys could be a bit much at times  and a little distracting, but in a way, they added to the flavor and  uniqeness of the novel. A fresh idea, or something that seemed out of the  ordinary to me, was Brandon's almost year-long celibacy. This is rare in  romance novels and refreshing, because the ultimate moment when Heather and  Brandon make love is looked forward to. (in other words, there are not  abundant sex scenes) When I finished the book, I missed the characters,  just as I always do with books I enjoy.",=

Four Stars,"Good information, easily understood",
Dracula,"I have watched several versions of Dracula but reading this book is the first time for me. Well, it has no close similarities with any movies I've seen except, of course, Bram Stoker's Count Dracula which has Hollywood spices in it. Compared to the movie, I felt the book's sense of the sensualities and Dracula's motivation in choosing his targets were less fluid and sometimes too coincidental. But I enjoyed the original hunting process more than the movie one, with treasured views from each man involved, not just Van Helsing's. My edition has the afterword which really helped to understand how the writing came to be like that but aside from all values it tried to represent, this is a referenced literature work everybody must not missed.",
"A must read!  Excellent, exciting, enlightening, evocative.","In Secret and Shadows is a must read for anyone intrigued with the concepts touched on in the da Vinci Code.  The difference is:  Janet's story is non-fiction!  Janet takes us on a fascinating journey through the history and intrigue of southern France, including the Cathars, Mary Magdalene, Occitania, the Catholic Church, and much, much more.  I literally could not put the book down.  Thrilling, engaging and enlightening best describe Janet's recollection of this real-life da Vinci Code.",

A die-hard Alex Cross fan expands her scope,"I have long been a fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross Mysteries.  I like Mr. Patterson's style of writing, as well as the depth to which he explores his characters.  I was not disappointed with this foray into a female lead in San Francisco.I was up late at night to read this, early in the morning to find out what was going to happen next...  it was great.  Only a few disappointments, but overall a good read.",
Many sections seem to have unclear explanations,"I find the book is focused on too many objectives, outlining history behind a particular subject and explaining complex ideas altogether in short sections. It makes the topics hard to follow, especially for readers new to this domain, and you will often need to use additional resources to fully comprehend the authors' intent. I'm utilizing this book as required reading, but definitely frustrating in some areas for non-experts. I do not recommend if this book is not required reading material for you.",
Warning - Horrible,Horrible to make a fake book about Snowden. Do not buy!,
Believable Characters,Hitchcock can weave a story populated with believable characters and never fails to throw in suspense.,
I appreciated Spithill for taking on the challenge of sharing his story and recommend this easy read,"Two-time America’s Cup winning skipper Jimmy Spithill opened the window wide open to his life in the release of ‘Chasing The Cup – My America’s Cup Journey.’ Spithill takes us on a trek that explains his character and convictions, from his early days around Sydney Harbor to the consolation beers following his recent defeat in Bermuda.The book is a tale with two halves: before Team Oracle and with Team Oracle.I found Spithill to be quite brave in the first half, revealing so much about his physical and family troubles. He was no silver-spooner, and the fight we have seen on the race course and interviews is well rooted in a bullied kid that found solace in the boxing ring and waterfront.His scrappy rise up the ranks earned him a lead position when Russell Coutts took over the reins of Team Oracle. Spithill shares the stories of these three America’s Cup campaigns, offering fascinating behind-the-scenes insight during the most disruptive period in the event’s modern history.Spithill also uses the book to even the score with critics, question authority, opine on parenthood, and teach the tenets of team. While the reporting on his Team Oracle era came with some bias, I believe he fulfilled his mission with the book to show how honest effort can be rewarded.I appreciated Spithill for taking on the challenge of sharing his story and recommend this easy read, especially to anyone who seeks to inspire youth sailors to reach farther.",
Five Stars,excellent read,
"Stupid, stupid, stupid","I'm sorry...I am very much in the minority, but...this book is a pathetic story about a pathetic young woman who is so self-absorbed that she is not able to see the reality of her situation.  Even if she hadn't 'lost' her mother, she would be adrift in the real world.  Yes, she does learn some things on her journey but her lack of understanding is monumental.  She is always on the lookout for her next 'sack-mate' at the expense of her soul's mending.  She reminded me of all the hippy-dippy dopers who floated from one experience to the next.  From the author's information of her life at present, it sounds like she made some break-throughs along the way.  That is good.  Because where she was in this book was not good.",
Audio CD read by Suzanne Toren,I was enchanted by this audio book. Suzanne Toren did a wonderful job narrating the story. I haven't read any of Kristin Hannah's books and I didn't expect much from the story line after having read the brief summary on amazon.com. I bought the audio version because I enjoy audio books narrated by Suzanne Toren and her voice surely lends a magical touch to this audio book.,
Finally!,"I love this book. It is full of very useful info and styling tips to help deal with curly hair. After reading it cover to cover, I went to the DevaCurl website to find out where to buy her products and immediately started using them. For the first time in my life I love my curls. Her website even provides a hairdresser search page to find a curl savvy stylist in your area.  And the dvd included with the book is great too, it shows you how to care for your hair and yes there is some product endorsement but hey, the products actually work and she shows you how to use them. It's a relief to finally find someone who understands how to deal with this unique and temperamental hair type. I fully reccommend this book.((8-2-2014 UPDATE:)) While I still refer back to this book from time to time for styling tips or to make one of the homemade recipes, I have switched to a different haircare product line called: ""Shea Moisture"". It's way more affordable and the products are awesome! They are also a lot easier to find locally. They are sold at both nationwide discount dept. stores as well as drug stores. IMO, for my hair at least, I think they perform better than the DevaCurl line of products. And for half the price!",

Fun Cozy Mystery Series,"This installment of the series was funny, and witty. The characters Anna and Pratt were interesting and the case they were involved in was plausible.

I use his books for Developer training in 6  colleges and companies in the New York area since 1997.  Most of the readers (my students) enjoy his books. The coverage of Applet is very poor. The next book, should have the SDK1.5 compiler or ?? version, with the Sun One Studio editor, and the source codes all installed on the CD-ROM.

simply wonderful,"This is a great book! The photographs are clear (no annoying fade outs so you can't see the image) and there are many detail photos.

I could easily picture finding the jewelry in this book at an upscale boutique or gallery. What's even better, the designs aren't trendy, which means you'll get a lot more wear from a piece and not feel its outdated a season later. I highly recommend this book!",

fun,"Sphere is a really cool book. I am a big fan of Chrichton, I love how he weaves fiction and non-fiction together in his books (he knows a lot about science if his books are any indication). If you saw and hated the movie (as I did), you should still pick up the book because it is far better. The book is very suspensful (if a bit predictable, but if the writing is good then its easy to overlook that). I loved the ending, its different and intriguing, it shows that the real enemy wasn't any of them, but rather the power the sphere had to offer. Highly recommended.",
Love this Bible!,"I was kind of skeptic to purchase because I read a comment that said that the letters are so small you can't even see them. I'm glad I did buy it because in reality, the letters are just fine! I can still read without my glasses and its pretty cool to have both the spanish and english versions in one page. This is a great buy and to tell you the truth, the bible itself is not as big and bulky as you would think for basically having two bibles in one! Highly recommend!",
This book is...,Superb; simply superb.,
Way ahead of its time.,"One of the truly great science fiction novels. Fast paced, exciting, and reads like an action movie written by the smartest, funniest guy you know.",
Three Stars,very adult topics....very full of dark topics,
All that glitters is not gold,"Joan London's ""The Golden Age"" is a promising story, tenderly written, and full of both hope and sorrow.  Set in Perth, Australia in the early-1950s, Frank and Elsa both suffer from polio.  They meet at The Golden Age, a converted pub that serves as a hospital for children recovering from the disease.  We learn quite a bit about Frank, a sensitive boy and a budding poet.  But Elsa remains a mystery -- a wispy shadow whose character isn't as well developed.Frank and Elsa's romance blossoms, but then it's cut short when the young couple gets a little too close. They both kicked out of the hospital.  That's when things go sideways in the story.  It's not that the ending was disappointing -- that's life -- I just wasn't sure if things made much sense.  I'll leave it to you to decide.  But to me, the book was very enjoyable, just lacking a bit in the final chapters.",
skip it,"This book begins much better than it ends. I'm a longtime Ludlum fan (I've read every book he's ever done), and for awhile, I really thought the Ludlum of old was back. I thought MATARESE COUNTDOWN and APOCALYPSE WATCH were just bad dreams I could forget.Nope. This one isn't much better. Ludlum does a great job hooking you with the premise, but then proceeds to go nowhere with it. The much vaunted &quot;high tech&quot; angle is rarely reflected in the plotline, which I thought got duller and duller as it went. It was a real struggle for me to finish the last 40 pages or so, because I just didn't care anymore.Overall, it reads like a lukewarm rehash of Ludlum's earlier (and much better) book AQUITAINE PROGRESSION. The problem as I see it, is that the Ludlum of today no longer connects the twists and turns to the story. Instead, the characters just stagger around from city to city, country to country, with little rhyme or reason to be found.Sigh. I think I'll go back now and re-read BOURNE IDENTITY.",
Another great book by Edwina!,So.e of the cutest little pictures to color!,
Five Stars,She is an amazing thinker.,
Refreshing!!!,"Well, i have to admit, i was quite surprised with this book. The main character is not your typical urban fantasy chick, you know the one that has become popular: really strong, whinny in a childish way and all the guys after her!She is actually smart, doesn't really complain, tries her best even though it's not always enough and has to wow!! get this, really work for it!There is no mushy romance but there is a bit of tension and one sex scene in the begining. However, the author tunned it down and focused on the really wicked plot and not the romance!!The story is delivered in a medium paced way where you actually get to understand and love the world you are discovering!I really recommend this and hopefully others will discover that we have a talented author rising!!!",

History of a brave young woman in WWI and shortly thereafter,"This is a wonderful story for many reasons. Maisie is a woman ahead of her time, she's gutsy, ambitious and smart as a whip.Maisie Dobbs began her first job at age thirteen. Her parents wanted to send her to college but the unexpected death of her Mum changed that and her father found a job for her in a suitable position.Maisie became a maid in an home of Lord and Lady Rowan Compton. Lady Compton was a suffragette and was for the advancement of woman in general. In Maisie, she noticed her in her library and Maisie told her she wanted to read books and learn. Lady Compton was impressed and kept her eye on Maisie. Later, when Maisie became an investigator she sent Maisie customers.Later, as WWI began, Maisie took nursing training and went to France to help care for the soldiers who were being injured in many ways with gas, shrapnel, bullet wounds and psychological injuries. While overseas, working with the soldiers she was drawn to one.After the war, Maisie uses some skills learned from one of Lady Compton's connections. Dr. Blanche was a trained psychologist and detective. He taught Maisie deductive thinking and since she had good common sense, he told her to trust her instincts and to beware of coincidences.Her first case leads her to a woman who would travel to a cemetery twice a week to mourn a young soldier. Maisie travels to a convalescent home being used for wounded and maimed soldiers.What I liked about the book was Maisie's compassion, her desire to raise above the situation to which she was born, and her manner in working with patients and the people around her.The scenes in France are well described and we get a look at the difficulties the young nurses faced during the Great War. They not only had to deal with soldiers wounded grievously but they had strict rules of behavior and little understanding for their plight.",
Four Stars,Excellent children's book - missing the CD.I found it on the internet!,

Worth the wait!,"Each year the authors delight their fans with a Christmas story packed with heart and action!  The previous Christmas titles are as follows:  A Lone Star Christmas, A Rocky Mountain Christmas, A Big Sky Christmas, A Frontier Christmas, A Texas Hill Christmas, A Colorado Christmas, An Arizona Christmas, A High Sierra Christmas, A Jensen Family Christmas and A MacCallister Christmas.  Each book can be read alone and in any order a reader chooses.  The novels include some of the favorite characters from Johnstone country such as Smoke and Sally Jensen, Preacher, etc.In A Death Valley Christmas, it was enjoyable to meet up again with Ace and Chance Jensen.  The story starts out with a descendant of theirs telling of one of the twin’s adventures from the past.  As I turned pages, it was not only the plot that held my attention but the geographic location of the tale.While these rugged men go wherever they choose, they have no problem stepping in to help those in need.  When Chance wins a silver mine in a poker game, what sounds promising may hold more trouble than it is worth.  Ace and Chance are each other’s best friend, and they rely on each other to come to the other’s aid if the need ever arises, which it does often!As I neared the end of the tale, the authors introduced a familiar character which brings even more excitement to the conclusion of the book.  I hope audiences will enjoy reading the newest addition to the Christmas series by these wonderful authors.  If you’ve missed any, I highly recommend obtaining copies and then prepare to cozy up to wild and exciting tales!",
how confusing can a calendar be?,"I love Lonely Planet calendars. For years they were perfect, then in 08 they changed their format. Not enough photos. I and many others complained to LP and I was told they were making an adjustment for 09. It is true, the photos are back to the old format more or less, BUT and it is a big BUT, they start the week on Monday. Sunday is all the way to the right. After one month of missed meetings and confusion with my life, I had to abort the LP 09 calendar.",

Everyone can find something to enjoy in this collection! The illustrations add so much to the atmosphere of the collection as well. Not to mention it touches on the important topic of mental health.

Excellent for me to see the bigger picture with teaching art!,"With being a homeschool mom to a preschooler and a 1st grader, this book came at a perfect time for me! I enjoyed how easy the lesson plans are to follow and that they are to the point. I appreciated that Jerry writes out the objectives for the first grader before diving in to the units. We are enjoying the creative process with each of the lessons! It has been a lot of fun to see my daughter start to look at the world around her with new eyes as the lessons have challenged her to take note of her world. This is an excellent resource for teachers, no matter your class size!I received this book from Celebrate Lit. This is my honest review and is in no way influenced by receiving a complimentary copy.",

A Good Weekend's Read,"When I started the book, I couldn't put it down.  Really enjoyed the development of the two main characters, Cain and Danziger.  Once the plot started linking in Meyer Lansky, Lucky Luciano and others, I started to have trouble following what was happening. If I was the author's editor, I would have told him to re-write the second half of the book and omit the mafia references.  I would have preferred the plot based on the letter writing.",

Not high-school geometry -- thank goodness!,"Well, typically most geometry self-teachning books focus on the topics typically covered in a high school geometry class, which I might add are quite simplistic in nature. I skimmed through this book at my local bookstore out of curiousity (I've had good luck with the demystified series, especially physics, by the same author), and what really caught my attention was the coverage of the elementary high school topics in a lean, mean six chapters with the rest covering hyperspace, warped space, polar coordinates, and basic vector mathematics.The quizzes are pretty good for reinforcing the concepts...they actually make you think (gee, what a concept)! It'd be nice if there were more of the problems, however (but not as many as Glencoe's books do). The tests really give one a sense of being in a classroom, especially since there's a final exam as well.This book is a gem, and for $13, you can't really go wrong.",$

Badly organized and edited,"Here are some examples of the errors in this book; I gave up on it around page 50.  It tries to distinguish between RISC and CISC but gets them backwards.  Most of the underscores in the code listings have been replaced by spaces.  It states that linked lists and arrays are the same thing.  A table refers to the &quot;Bite size&quot; of processor architectures.  Structurally, it jumps quickly into a deep description of x86 instruction scheduling without explaining why.  There's some useful information in there, if you can find it through the errors and poor organization.  There are better books on the topic.",

Delightful pictures illustrate this story that teaches good values,"This has been a favorite in our house for 20+ years. With our first child and now with our youngest. The pictures are wonderful, your child will love finding new things every time they read the book. And the messege that is taught, each time the fairy purchases a new animal and then sets it free after she admires it or when she shares her coat with the frog so he can stay warm. The message of caring for others is expressed in an easy to understand way. Great book for children and adults to share.",+
A Fabulous Addition To Any Art Lovers Collection!,"Belle and Brimstone find themselves on a journey they were destined to make. Being butterflies, and stuck in a painting for centuries, their life was uneventful and motionless, until that one day when fate stepped in, not only educating the butterflies, but educating the reader, as well. In trying to find their own painting, they had been popped out of when it was being taken to the Conservation Studio, the butterflies find themselves on an adventure, eluding danger, meeting new characters in other paintings. Belle's humor will delight children as they read the story, wondering if the butterflies will ever reunite with their painting. Mary Lee Corlett has created a masterpiece of her own, while the artist, Phyllis Saroff, brings her fun and illuminating story to life. What a fantastic pair. Children and adults of all ages will devour and relish this 56 page softcover picture book.",

Every week, I give the students a reading comprehension quiz; this book's quiz was the only one on which every student received an A.  I suppose one hypothesis is that I made the quiz too easy that week, but I suspect that the students did so well because they found the book particularly engaging and memorable.  The class discussion was also particularly enthusiastic.The book is easily accessible to a broad audience.",

Intelligence enhancing without games,"You won't agree with all and maybe you'll disagree with most, but they are provocative, mind challenging, and often quotable.

Uninteresting first chapter.,"With the best intentions (and a lot of concentration), I managed to get through the first chapter of Oryx and Crake.  But then I closed the book forever.  Maybe I just don't like science fiction, but I didn't find the book interesting at all.  It's unfair for me, perhaps, not to begin chapter two, but I have a rule never to read a second chapter if the first one bores me.  And Oryx and Crake did.",
Five Stars,Perfect,
GREAT BOOK,"SUCH A GREAT BOOK! While I still think the 4th one was just a little bit better, it was still a great read. The suspense was great as it is with all the books in the sieries.  I also loved the characters, especially Clare because she reminded me of myself. Cassandra Clare also did a wonderful job at describing each scene. It really. Made me feel like I was part of. The book. The only thing I didn't really like about the book was the fact that the 2 main characters were apart for a majority of the time. Still, I really hope there is a 6th book because I'm already wondering what's going to happen next.",

A Great Book To Own,"When a cookbook gives me at least one really great recipe, it is worth the money. This book provides page after page of scrumptious fare! It is for those with adventuresome tastebuds and willing to invest a little time preparing a tasty meal. Do not buy this book if you are looking for appetizer recipes in the typical sense. The recipes in this collection feature flavors from around the world. They run the gamut from bread based tasties to flavorful soups, unique salads, vegetables, pasta, meats and seafoods with a nice assortment of sauces and salsa. Each dish typically provides about 4 - 6 small servings. Make several for a little party, or prepare one just for yourself with leftovers. Enjoy!",

Five Stars,Thank you for the great playscript,
Transported,"The farther I got in to this book, the more I liked it, and two days after finishing it, it is still on my mind. It fulfilled my strongest desire for a reading experience: to be transported to another time and place. The first part, chronicling Sidonie's pre-Morocco experiences of disease and loss, was difficult reading, because it was hard to watch someone having such a miserable life (although the author made it completely believable). But, once she got to Morocco, the story really turned around for me. The author did a great job of depicting the country, and I felt that I was there with Sidonie. The characters were interesting and well developed. From a travel standpoint, it was great: the very atmospheric back alleys of Marrakesh in 1930 and the landscape beyond the cities, with the nomadic Tuaregs. But it was also fascinating to watch Sidonie's development from a sheltered, repressed individual to one with growing confidence and a real sense of being where she was meant to be. This was almost as much of a story as the more obvious plot line. I look forward to reading other books by this author.",

There are unfortunately very few children's books involving the topic of technology that are interesting to younger students.  This book is one of the best according to my Kindergarteners and 1st graders.Some of the language in the story is a bit challenging for such young students, but the rhyming/sing-songy flow of the book makes it very understandable overall.

Kerry is an exceptional leader and dedicated public servant. I also appreciated his personal sharing of faith. It was so helpful to hear.

The surface story is easy to like and may seem very light but structurally this is a very complex work.  Like  Garcia Marquez's other novels, it can be read on more than one level, and lends itself to analysis and interpretation.",
Another disappointing effort,"I should have known better, after reading Shaara's previous book on the First World War, which I thought was a mediocre volume. After reading his latest effort, I must say that I likely won't waste my time reading another of his books. I applaud him for writing a book about this campaign, but it is again painfully obvious that he has limited writing skills, a poor grasp of character development, a lack of technical knowledge regarding weapons, army organization, etc., and a real ignorance of militaries other than the United States. As other reviewers have stated, the few battle scenes are poorly drawn, and unexciting, he makes numerous technical errors, and the fictional protangists in particular are unconvincing. Another reviewer mentioned the removal of Jewish American POWS, by black trench-coated Gestapo agents, in Tunisia, in May. Never happened, and this was the final straw for me. I will admit that I expect an author to know his subject, especially when it comes to historical topics. If Bernard Cornwall, Patrick O'Brien, W.E.B. Griffith,C.S. Forrester, etc., etc. can do it, why not Shaara? It amazes me that so many people rave about this book, and his earlier efforts. He apparently has a well-oiled publishing machine, and he sells books, so the bottom line is that we can expect more of the same, but I doubt any any better effort will result.",

Great comprehensive history,"In terms of format, this book is almost like a textbook of Byzantine history. Each chapter has a clear purpose and a mini-timeline, differences in text size and shape mark off the sections and subsections, and there are even inserts every few pages with primary sources. This actually helped me mentally organize the details of what was happening - there's a lot to keep track of in 12 centuries!A few elements that I really liked:1) Graphic Organizers and Visuals. The author occasionally made use of graphic organizers - for example, representing the hierarchy of Byzantine governments with a table, or showing the decline in value of the nomismata in the 11th century. In addition, rather than banishing the images to an appendix, the author actually integrates them into the relevant sections of the text. It's a pleasant surprise to find a historian who actually appreciates the value of a good illustration to, you know, illustrate history.2) Breadth. This is a broad history - the focus is not just on the emperors or on Constantinople, but on the Empire as a whole. I appreciate that the author takes the time to explore social and economic trends, art, literature, and ordinary life.3) Historiography. The author cites other scholars, and also talks about both debates and shifts in understanding. The best example was his take on the Blues vs. Greens fights of the 5th-6th centuries. According to the author, while older scholars often tried to impose a religious, class, or political ideology on these fights, it's better to view the Blues and Greens as the Late Antiquity version of football hooligans who liked to riot. As a non-expert, it's actually helpful for me to understand how scholarship has changed.4) The last chapter is about post-Byzantine Byzantine culture. Most Byzantine histories that I read use the last chapter to eulogize the fallen empire. In contrast, this author actually explores what happened to Byzantine culture after the Ottoman conquest. I appreciate that the author acknowledges that the Greeks, Armenians, and Slavs didn't just magically stop practicing their culture after 1453.Great general history, would recommend it to anyone new to the Byzantine fandom.",

A great summer read.,"This is not a book that I would normally choose. I enjoyed it thoroughly and learned about WWII, and the Philippines.",
Great story that starts out slow,Fantastic story that is a little hard to get started but well worth the read. It feels like there’s a little lost in translation but it’s good,
Loved the format and writing was amazing,Outstanding read. Loved the format and writing was amazing. Can't wait for the next book from this author.,
Read about microsprinkers!,This volume highlights the most compatible native plants for California gardens. Lots of color pictures and outstanding advice regarding how to care for native plants.  I particularly like the idea of micro-sprinklers instead of all that ugly black irrigation lines.,
Loved this small town romance!,"I'm so happy I discovered this! The abs definitely drew me in, but the story was sweet and fun and kept me entertained. The main characters Mia and Nate have so much in common and I was pushing for them to be together from the start. Both were a bit isolated from other people and needed someone who understood what they were going through. They also bond over their love of Mia's grandmother, who may be one of the best gran's ever!Mia is a bit all over the place emotionally. She's just decided to quit her job at her dad's law firm and her parents do not take it well. They're incredibly selfish people and I was glad that Mia distanced herself from them. Her grandmother is great and encourages her to pursue other interests, including getting her with Nate. Nate is a retired doctor from L.A., now living in a small town. He's interested in Mia immediately and I loved watching them get closer.There are a couple sad moments in this, but overall it's a fun story about doing what you're passionate about and not holding back. I'll definitely be checking out other books from this author!I received a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",
"Dark, violent, and fascinating","I'm kind of torn about how to rate this. I almost want to rate it 5 stars because it was such a good story, but there were quite a few times were I felt that it went a bit too far w/ the violence. Now, I don't particularly mind dark or violent themed books, I usually enjoy them, but I want it to make sense and not just to be there for shock value which I kind of felt happened throughout this book. It sort of went from being reminiscent of Harry Potter to suddenly becoming like one of those Saw movies!Still, I will absolutely, without doubt be continuing this series.",
Wonderful book full of imagination!  Illustrations are so lovely.,"This book and accompanying coloring book was such a huge hit for my sister's grand daughter. She loved that she was able to read the book all by herself and stopped on several pages to talk about each unicorn and which was her favorite.  She decided to color the pages ""just like the pictures in the book"" because they were so beautiful.  Great book for spending time just imagining these beautiful creatures and talking about what makes each one unique!",
Very interesting,"Can't imagine going through what S. Cahalan experienced, but was fascinated all the way through this one.  Given the subject matter, it was interesting how readable Cahalan was able to make this one.  I enjoyed it very much.",

Nearly flawless!,"4.5/5This was a pretty dang good story. It had mystery and suspense and horror. Some of it corporeal and some of it ethereal. There are many moments here where I envisioned a movie with jump scares and a booming soundtrack, and I found that super cool. I had to suspend my disbelief and go with the action as it unfolds and that was a little bit of a bummer. In the end I was satisfied.",

Beautiful pics.,Beautiful pictures of people in private moments. Good quality. I read tthis book in exchange for my rewview.,
Sexy pageturner with my favorite trope!,"Let’s start with the main characters – Georgie and Travis. They both grew so much over the course of this story, which I lived for. Not only them, there were also side characters showing obvious signs of growth. Any author capable of doing that deserves an extra star in my book!When it comes to Georgie, I specifically loved seeing her go from being and feeling the “little sister” towards being her own woman, standing up for herself and fighting for what she wants. Seeing that evolution was wonderful.As mentioned in the triggers, there are quite a few explicit sex scenes in this book. I didn’t mind them at all – but I know some people don’t care for that type of thing. All in all, I found them well written – apart from all the dirty talk. I’m simply.. not that kind of person so I wouldn’t have mind had that aspect not been present, haha.In my intro, I mentioned the renovating company being one of the things that piqued my interest. It wasn’t that present, but it was there enough for me to be satisfied. As for the fake relationship-trope? I loved how it was done! Not every author is able to pull it off, but I enjoyed seeing Georgie and Travis struggle with their feelings, doubting the realness of their fake relationship and eventually having to admit to themselves what was going on. Yup, definitely my cup of tea!I only have ONE but:Travis, our other main character, definitely had his own demons to fight. Unfortunately, the story focused way more on Georgie’s growth, struggle and evolution than it did on his. I would’ve loved to have more insight in his past, his brain and his feelings. It would have added so much more to the story!4 / 5!I cannot wait to read the sequel - which focuses on two characters present in this one: Dominic and Rosie. So curious to find out their story!",
One Star,I didn't like the book. I would like to return it.,
Great read,So amazing to get an insight in all the struggle that went in to making the band a success.  RIP Chester,
I was not disappointed.,"After reading book one, I knew I would read book two.  I was not disappointed.",
I think the most enjoyable thing of this novel was the ending,"This review has been crossposted from my blog at The Cosy Dragon.com. Please head there for more in-depth reviews by me, which appear on a timely schedule.'Skeleton Key' is the third book in this series about Alex Rider, a teenage spy. Alex is sent on an expensive holiday to Skeleton Key in Cuba. Well, it's supposed to be a holiday, but really he's there to do his job - nuclear war is coming. Hit the jump for more...Alex is given the opportunity to see tennis live at Wimbledon. However, instead of the interesting time he expected to have, he uncovers a sinister plot by the Triad. He heads off on a surfing holiday with his budding girlfriend Serena, but is followed there by the Triad. MI6 says that they will put him out of harm's way by sending him on a tropical vacation. What could go wrong? Everything in fact.I think the most enjoyable thing of this novel was the ending, seeing Alex push through the terrors he had been through to become a better person on the other side. In this novel you can really see him grow up, and start taking an interest in girls. Horowitz has managed to take a series that could become quite stale with the same character and same spy elements and make it continue to develop.This novel is more bloody than the first two novels (in the same way that the Harry Potter series became more adult as it progressed). I'd still say that children could read it, but not those with impressionable minds or those who were likely to be scared. If they enjoyed the first two novels, this is certainly not too much of a step forward.",
The strength of this book is its focus on the life stories of individual civil servants.,"It does not neglect the big picture, and provides extensive description of Trump's transition team (which he had to be forced to accept.) But it is the tales of the several civil servants, gleaned from interviews, that I found most compelling.  With the help of reporters like Jenny Hopkinson of Politico and Rachael Bale of National Geographic, Lewis show us how dedicated professionals like Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Frank Klotz, Cathie Woteki, DJ Patil, Lillian Salerno, and John MacWilliams were frustrated by the Trump appointees who came in late to their departments, neither knowing or caring much about the jobs they were taking on but filled with loyalty to Trump and set on monetizing such vital functions as weather forecasting.This book is an excellent complement to name-filled chronologies like Russian Roulette, and I consider it a must read.",
I Will Never Forget is Enlightening and Inspiring!,"Elaine C. Pereira's captivating memoir, I Will Never Forget is a moving book written with a gentle and humorous tone describing her mother's journey through dementia. The author helps us to understand the frightening and awkward aspects of dementia. I would consider the book,  I Will Never Forget, a comforting companion for caregivers coping with dementia. It is also a beautiful study and response to her mother's life. Truly Inspiring and Enlightening!",
A Sympathetic Vampire Assassin,"This novel is the gentlest of Ms. Kroese's fantasies and my personal favorite thus far.  The story contains elements of the hard-hearted hero who loves puppies and kittens and the hooker with the heart of gold woven into a tale of violence, destruction, magic, and love.  The social issues evident in the fantasy correlate easily with many of today's headlines. Ms. Kroese's choice to have dual narrators takes a little time to grasp on beginning the novel, but works well in presenting two points of view.",
Suggested to me by other Francophiles like me!,Loved the read.,
a good read,"Picked this up one afternoon and put it down only to perform life’s necessities. A bit too long, but a good story arc and satisfying conclusion",
Great Deal!,"Great Deal for the price compared to hard bound journals. All the fields are accounted for, lifhtweight. Love it!",
He said he enjoyed the book,This was for my son. He said he enjoyed the book. Fast shipping!,
A must read!,"Best book I've read in quite some time. As soon as I finished it, I wanted to read it again. The story is written with a compelling narrative pull and complex characters who are both memorable and admirable. I was fascinated with each individual character's story which ultimately blended to be a very rich novel indeed. I didn't want it to end.",
Interesting Follow-Up,"Well, this sure did start one place and go somewhere no one could have ever seen coming.In this follow-up to the Cinderella story, the stepsisters are followed in the aftermath of what happened after the night they tried to hack their feet up to fit in the slipper that Cinderella rightfully owned. It starts with them having to deal with an entire town of people snickering and mocking them for being ""ugly"" and terrible people for what they did to poor Ella. They locked her up and made her a servant to them,etc (you know the story). So, people charge them more for less and they run low on money so bad things happen.The story really focuses on one stepsister though both are part of the whole story. Isabelle is the main character and the one that longs the most to be beautiful because she feels that to be beautiful is all it takes to get what you want in the world. Like Ella. So when she meets a ""fairy god mother"" of sorts that's what she says she wants the most so when she is told she needs to do somethings before her wish can be granted, she sets out to do them.On the other side she has ""fate"" and ""chance"" betting on her. Each comes into play as a person in her life. How they play their part is for you to find out.So much is going on and happening in this book, I'm not even touching the surface. This book is packed full of story. It has some 'girl power' themes running through it that are really good with some strong messages for young and old alike. It has so many good things going for it! If I were to say anything negative at all it would be that I have to admit at one or two points I got pulled out of the story a little bit. I'm not sure if there was just so much going on it got distracting or if at a few points there was a lull that just stalled it? Either way, it picked back up and got real good again!All in all this is an interesting take on what happened after Cinderella left in the carriage to wed her prince.",

The Perpetual Reference and Guide,"I'm still trying to decide how to describe this book. It strives to be a classic textbook in a great many areas and succeeds quite well. I feel as though I'm in a textile school and using a professional text when studying this book. By submerging yourself in the information you will become very well informed and, through practice, skilled in several areas of needlework. Included here is information on every aspect of basic stitchery and then some. You are introduced through picture and charts to materials, frames, hoops, notions and various floss', pearl cottons, blending filament, silks, wools and threads in great detail. Then specific stitches, not just cross stitch, but many others that may be used individually or with cross stitch are introduced.(The photography and charting is excellent, showing some of the best detail work I've yet seen.) And you go on to exercises that develop skill in that particular technique or material or both with the use of a motif. There is information on creating patterns, working with computer design, reproducing designs from pictures, using mirrors to graph corners, reverse designs, central themes and borders. There is even a section on blocking. Much more is included in this book than I could record here. This is really a compendium. As was stated by another reviewer, this is not a book of motifs or independent projects and it doesn't pretend to be one. It is the sort of refrence book that will be looked at often.",

Therapy,"This is my favorite book of all time.  Whenever I need a laugh, I take this out and read it….again.  My husband and I know parts of it by heart and use phrases from this book as shorthand to describe events around us or some activity we intend to pursue.  The illustrations are like old friends because I've seen them so many times.  You can show me a drawing from this book and I will know what story it illustrates, what action is taking place, and sometimes I can give you the caption verbatim.  The reason I bought this book at this time was that my paperback copy is falling apart and I thought it was high time I had a hardback copy for safety's sake.I will comment that the printing in this particular edition is blurry in several places.",
Balm to my introverted mama soul,"I am only a little ways into this book so far but I have laughed, cried, and just breathed such a great sigh of relief! Someone finally gets me and I am not crazy!

Absorbing account of Korean war battles,This is the latest in the author's series of  books which attempt to look at war through the eyes of participants on both sides.  The accounts of the battles during the U. S. forces' retreat from the Yalu River are particularly well done with vivid and detailed descriptions of the intense action.,
Superb guide for becoming emotionally intelligent,"Charles Stanley has put together a superb guide to unraveling the truth about our emotions and lies about the same. In a day and age when emotions seem to be out of control frequently for so many people, this book is a necessity. If only someone taught young people how to handle their emotions and deal with them successfully, we would not hear about the violent tragedies which have come to be part of our daily lives. This book helps do just that. It has helped me tremendously. I also found great help in a book by Lin Tomasso which I recently downloaded to my laptop. It's called Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered. I paid $2.99 for it at smashwords.com. You can download it to your computer or any device, nothing special needed. The author is straight forward and funny, and will have you laughing at her real life experiences-she puts on no airs. Thanks to her book, I learned how to pray correctly. There's a formula for prayer which actually produces results, so if you're going to pray, you'd might as well do it right. I'm seeing positive results now since I corrected my former errors. I highly recommend both books, and I want to say again that Lin Tomasso's Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered at smashwords.com will truly help you get your prayers answered so I’m spreading the word so that others can receive the benefits I have. I believe both these books will help every reader.",$
Mirrors are one of the few things that easily freak me out..,"I received a free copy of Mirror Image from the publisher in return for an honest review.I was excited to make a start on Mirror Image because mirrors are one of the few things that easily freak me out. I was looking forwards to immersing myself in a story that had the potential to put me on edge, unfortunately, that didn't happen. It took me 4 days to read 325 pages, kinda says it all really.The book started off well but I soon found my attention wandering. I couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters, they were flat and unappealing. The reasonings behind the characters actions were insubstantial, I felt like they were just going through the motions for the sake of the story. Where was the fear? The inner conflict? The panic? There was nothing of substance driving them, they came across as puppets playing out a story rather than real people living through the story.Throughout the book the reader is taken back and forth between several different timelines. The timelines reveal the history of the mirror, how it came to be, and the characters that have been a part of its story before the present timeline. For this format to work the different timelines need to come together, to flow into each other and build a bigger picture, a more in-depth understanding, but in this case they felt disjointed and too separate from one another. The ending felt rushed and thrown together. I think I was holding out hope that things would come together in the end and that it would at least be worth the reading time invested. It wasn't, it lead to even more disappointmentThere was also quite a few inconsistencies and plot holes, as well as many spelling mistakes, typos, wrong words etc, which really didn't help improve the reading experience.Not one I would recommend.",
I was disappointed. These jokes were based upon UK humor,"I was disappointed.  These jokes were based upon UK humor, and many of the jokes did not make sense to me, as I aman American living in the U.S.A.  Sorry to say, this book was not a good choice for me.",
The Jerico Deception,The Jerico Deception is a pager turner. It has a clear quick movie like quality that takes you in completely.  The questions posed within the story line are timely and profound.  Character driven this read keeps you cheering for the science as well as the scientists.,
"When you run out of Narnia books, give this a shot","This is book five in a series of eight.  Imagine a Christian version of Indiana  Jones who travels the word with his two teenage kids having archeological adventures in the 1990's.This book is not the best in the series, and the series is not the best writing Peretti has ever done.  The plots, dialog, character development, and style in the five books I've read so far just aren't on par with some of the other books he has written.  That said, my 9 and 12 year old children love the series and I can be confident that each page is kid safe.  The stories may not have allegories and apologetical theory wrapped in every other sentence, but they have a sprinkle of scripture in good measure along with practical application of faith by each and every character that is believable.This particular book has an unexplained premise that really doesn't make a lot of sense even when you are open to a supernatural explanation.  The resolution also leaves a lot to be desired as it doesn't fit either into a good theologian's prayer book or a Scooby-Do scientific ""Man behind the curtain"" kind of explanation.  But like most of the books in this series, the plot allows for tension to build through the story that gives the author time to plant seeds of wisdom and faith.  And more importantly as I said before, my kids are no where near as critical as I am and truly loved it.  If you're looking for a series of Christian themed books for young adults, this series is pretty good.",
A must-have for F-111 fans,"I'd give this six stars if I could.  The research that went into compiling this book is incredible.  I have limited personal knowledge of some of the facts surrounding some of the losses described in the book because I was a crew chief on F-111Fs at RAF Lakenheath during the 1980s when we lost a handful of birds, but the ""official"" word on losses often didn't filter down to we maintenance troops so it's nice to now read the full accounts.  I wish the authors would compile more major mishap (non-loss) data for a second edition; I personally know of some major incidents (in-air collisions, speed-inflicted damage, etc.) that aren't reflected in the book's section on mishaps, and I'm just one former knuckle dragger -- I bet interviewing former aircrews and crew chiefs would reveal a ton of additional incidents.",

Meh,"Not my favorite one yet, but it wasn't awful. Just, meh. I'm losing faith in Jimmy... I realize that's harsh, but it's true.",
SciFi/Futurism,Excellent read that kept me on the edge of my chair the entire book. Lee’s prose flows well.,
One of my new favorites!!,"Melanie has a way with words and making her books come to life and make you feel like you have known the characters all your life.Tease was an excellent story about two friends who were both quirky in their own way. They understood each other and had some much love that they don’t want to admit.Hutton, I felt so much for him, with his  anxiety and not being around a bunch of people. My son is the same way.Felicity was amazing with him and they could both be themselves around each otherThe side characters made the story as well! Hutton’s mom and the Prancin’ Grannies were hilarious!I can’t wait to read about Millie’s story!",

good read,enjoyed except one page was ripped out of the start of chapter28 page number is391.,
Really?,"Should have been either MUCH shorter, say 6-8 paragraphs, or a real novel.  Preposterous, sappy, story line over written for this length, under developed for a real read.Felt more like an early morning writing exercise than a real short story.  Perhaps it was the beginning of a novel that the writer decided to stop developing?.  Purchased on recommendation of other readers.  Thank goodness it was free",
Written as a teen / young adult story,"I couldn’t finish this book. The author’s voice verges on “silly  romantic” as she writes of serious, wartime espionage coupled with handsome men. I have read a lot of nonfiction accounts of the OSS and SOE, so the name dropping was disconcerting. Okay, so the “girls” get their man at the end and presumably live happily ever after. The book gives historical fiction a bad name.",
Two Stars,Too detailed for me,
Tempe Fugits & Fidgets,"This is the least appealing of the bones books I have read. Were it not for the opening chapter of Temperance's childhood friendship and the resolution of her mysterious disappearance plus plausible family circumstances both well-written, I would have rated this helper-skelter plot lower than 3 even a (gasp) 1?. Why  sister Harry appears; the excessive characters and their thin relationships to what may be the central, tawdry plot, excessively detailed; and the scattering of details about intertwined stirrings for both men of several earlier tomes, an ongoing limpid theme replete with needy grown children now dividing the foci of Tempe and the ongoing marriage with Pete, the Unfaithful;and stirrings for the rival Ryan's affections ...all are Cuisinarted throughout the book.I did like the setting, as I love Montreal, and added several patois phrases to my French vocabulary. Was it worth the read...only for the Quebec and Cajun cultural notes. It appears that the rationale is to now pull strips with character names, horrible crimes against girls as young as toddlers, then attempt to weave the into a book. Editor! Editor! Save some trees: 1/3?could easily have been cut. I have another book, but hesitate to read it...or even donate it: tawdriness does not become the author. Nor the reader.",
A worthy health plan,"I'm vegan, not a raw foodist, but love raw ""cook""books to help me find delicious summer recipes. I requested this review copy from the publisher for this reason, and because I love to try out and explore new vegan cookbooks. Heather Bowen walks one through a 21-day raw food plan, with charts and food plans to make sure your diet is well-balanced. If you want a good primer to help you to eat raw, this will give you a quality foundation.One of my favorite ""recipes"" was ""Make Your Own Smoothie"": pick among a checklist of bases, fats, fruits, veggies, superfoods, supplements, sweeteners, etc. etc. So much fun to mix and match your own!  I appreciated all the different smoothies in the book, and the cashew and coconut yogurt recipes.Quite a few recipes call for a dehydrator, which is not something I've found necessary for my kitchen at this time. Of course, since raw food veganism requires lots of nuts and seeds, the recipes are much higher in fat than I enjoy. In addition, the cookbook has very few photos. Raw food really shines when one can see the rainbow!  These reservations aside, this is a quality cookbook and food guide that would be a worthy addition to your shelf if you're looking to eat more raw.",
Three Stars,"Intricate set of events - interesting but, at times difficult to follow.",
Just a coffee table book,"I'm a big fan of Bear Grylls and the Man Vs. Wild series. That said, this is an interesting read, nice pictures, but it's not much more than a picture album for the Man Vs. Wild series. It makes a very interesting coffee table book. But if you're looking for a true survival manual, look elsewhere (The SAS Survival Handbook is excellent). ""The Kid Who Climbed Everest: The Incredible Story of a 23-Year-Old's Summit of Mt. Everest"" is also a book by Bear Grylls and is very good.",
