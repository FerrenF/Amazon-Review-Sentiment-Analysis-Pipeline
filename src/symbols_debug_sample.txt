Not the page turner the rest of Grisham books are.,"A bit repetitive, didn't at all like the too many emails between the students and their loan officers - as an attorney with student loans, I have never received an email from the lender.  Zola cries the whole way through.  I also didn't believe the loyalty these three showed to one another.  Law students are competitive.  It wrapped up nicely but to name the new bar the Rooster Bar = how to get the FBI to find you in the country where Zola is from and left to see her parents.  Grisham is the best writer and the only one I read but this one is not his best (least fav after the baseball and Christmas stories and the horrible ending of the Testament.)  The rest were all five star novels.  Worth the read, just not his best.  Not the page turner almost all of his other novels are.",=

Awesome Book!,I think this book is great.So informative.I did start this diet on Dec. 8th before I received the book and I have actually lost 3 lbs.I don't know if it as just water or not but I can tell you that this diet is not hard at all.

Read this book,"It's the best book you'll ever read, after reading the hunger games by Susan Collins, I thought I would never find a book that could even compare to it. But despite being biased to the hunger games, I thought this book was better than the hunger games. Although they are not alike, both are amazing books. Even if u haven't read the hunger games, u should still read this book, it was aging and I wish it never ended so that I could just keep reading.",
Five Stars,Awesome book. Very intertaining....,
An intimate reflection upon the lifelong connection Morris Day had with Prince.,"I never used to be a huge Morris Day fan but I am now! I was at Paisley Park when the Time performed 2 months before Prince died. At the time I had no idea how special that night would become years later with Prince finally making amends with Morris. I believe Prince new he was leaving us soon and it was important for him to say goodbye to Morris Day, the band members and all the great memories.",
This book is a complete waste of time,"This book is a complete waste of time, first of the colored bold face type throughout the book makes it annoying to read, the color charts are not an accurate representation of the true shades. I think their first book is the best, after that most of the books have only a small portion that is applicable to any one body type. This is a very basic book and probably good for the color blind.",
Just Excellent,Excellent book. Will change the way you look at life. I was so impressed by this book that I ordered most of the other books written by this author. I was equally impressed and enjoyed each one. You feel uplifted after reading them.  I now send this book to friend's and relatives as a gift who I think it may benefit. I have never done this before with any book.,
Five Stars,Good read,
Bargus,"Although the story line was unique, and the plot kept me guessing until nearly the end who the stalker was, once again I find it difficult to &#34;love&#34; Ms Staub's use of verbs in the present tense (ie: she is leaving the room, she sits up, etc) which is distracting.  It was ok for the price but I would not read this book again or recommend it.",
So cute!!,"This book is adorable. The flaps are sturdy and small, difficult for an infant to really grab with a fistful and tear. She has to use her pincer grip to even touch the flaps (at 9 mo).",
Really fast funny and inspiring.,It has some swearing in it. I found it silly,
Soap opera history,"I truly like it, though I missed Herod. He was such a main character in the series on the BBC, I was surprised he was unmentioned. The second volume fills in all of Herod's antics right away in flashback fashion. That filled in the missing part.",
Skip this Mess,"This book was so bad, I'm not even sure who the author is or what his job was. What high priced attorney makes his investigator sleep on the floor and have no access to office machines? This book is nothing more than a compilation of other people's work. I didn't.t get past chapter two. Terrible whinny writing with a dash of smart a$$. I wanted to punch this guy just for being him. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. There isn't anyone who thinks Scottie is innocent but this clown tried to make a case that cops jumped to conclusions. Would have , could have, been an interesting book but there was no meat on the bones. Plus his authorial voice was annoying.",$$
Little Miss History Travels... Get Your Complete Set Today!,"Little Miss History Travels to Ellis Island is another amazingly well-written book with so much history. What I love most about this author's books is historical information coupled with rich truths/facts and fantastic illustrations...I just knew I'd enjoy this book, and so many others will, too. We are living during an era where there's much talk about immigration, and immigration laws, so books like this one will usurp much diverse conversations. Adults can help children sort through puzzling questions using respectful discourse one to another...School officials: History teachers, and librarians should have loads of these books on campuses, and classrooms all over. Parents: You will want a complete set of the &#34;Little Miss History Travels to...&#34; books in your home library as well...Get yours today!",
Unique Counting Book to Add to Your Child's Collection,"How many counting books can you own? My suggestion is you make room for one more, because Abigail is worth it. She’s trying to count spots and stripes, but her friends keep moving on her. Then there are more issues and it takes some ingenuity before all three friends get together for some counting fun...The design features giraffe spots on the inside front and back covers, plus there is a special flip up page with a neat surprise inside. Rayner uses warm, soft colors that appeal to the eye and create a calming effect. This would make a nice bedtime book or naptime book...I received a copy of this book from the publisher. This review contains my honest opinions, which I have not been compensated for in any way.",
"Authentic, vivid, and heartbreaking","I am, perhaps unsurprisingly, a very big fan of Cormac McCarthy's western novels.  And horses.  After my acquaintance with both, I can say with no reservations that the way Hagy writes horses and the west is authentic and vivid.  While Will Testerman occupies many more pages of narrative than the horse of the title does, Boleto (or ""Ticket"") is by far the most tangibly drawn character in the book, and not just because we know what color she is...I was strongly reminded of McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679744398 All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, Book 1)]] in many ways, but Hagy has her own voice.  Testerman is in many ways an admirable character and a pleasure to read about.  Even if he does live under a sense of constant failure, he has a real heart for serving others, even when it's difficult.  The themes of the human-horse relationship and betrayal were powerful ones, and used well.  At a crucial point in the story (won't spoil it), I felt my stomach drop along with Will's, and I very nearly cried at the book's conclusion...Perhaps the only thing I can say negative about the novel - and it's no small thing - is the gratuitous sex (and extremely gratuitous, vulgar descriptions) throughout.  When reading McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679760849 The Crossing (The Border Trilogy, Book 2)]] in class years ago, a classmate said ""This isn't realistic at all - he doesn't have sex!""  Well, Testerman certainly makes up for Billy Parham's celibacy.  I don't expect Testerman to abstain from all female contact - but the explicit and unnecessary descriptions of his many, many encounters, while they didn't completely ruin the book for me, made me decide against keeping it.  I can't ever imagine wanting to reread those passages again...I'd love to read some of Hagy's other work - this book has certainly given me a taste for it.  She knows how to use her words economically and with restraint, while still allowing expression for sublime beauty.  I just wish she didn't think she had to be vulgar to be realistic.",
I ran out right away.....,"to buy this book, as two of the author's others: The Sensualist and The Tattooed Map are two of my alltime favorite books.  Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. This is the story of Hippolyte, to me an annoying, unlikeable and dirty smelly explorer type (hmmm...the heroine in The Tattooed Map was also none too clean..)who sets out to find some islands that supposedly do not exist. Sounds like a good story, right? Well, it would have been, except that the bulk of the story consists of Hippolyte trying to convince his editor that his journey was fact and not fiction, as she believes. This is done mostly through letters and notes of historical facts sent back and forth. The &quot;finding the islands&quot; part was way too small, and the rest of the book was sooo boring that any mystery etc. regarding these islands is overshadowed by the simple fact that I didn't want to read on. Also, there is some kind of completely unbelievable romance type thing beginning between Hippolyte and his editor Marie that begins to make the book a little bit more interesting, but it never fully develops into anything. Because I paid full price for this book, I forced myself to finish it. I must say that the illustrations did distract from the boredom of the continuous facts and figures in the book, thus raising it's rating from two to three stars.  All in all, I was sorely disappointed, especially since I was so looking forward to another novel by this, one of my favorite authors.",
Introduction to the New Testament by Raymond Brown,"This is a great book. Ray Brown is a scholar who has the ability to write so clearly that he is able to pull together years of study and scholarship and bring beginners, students and Scripture readers up to speed on the latest in Biblical understand. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the Bible and how to read it and understand it.",
Thank you,Perfect,
Five Stars,Fantastic read!!,
I loved Harri!!,"Meet Tracy Clark's new Detective Harriet ""Harri"" Foster! Hide takes place in Chicago and is a mystery/crime genre book, which is my favorite! It's told from the criminal's POV, as well as the investigator's POV...I liked Harri, whose life has been incredibly challenging for the past few years. She not only lost her son five years ago she also lost her last partner to suicide. She is now working in a different precinct - one that has a team of detectives who are a mix of good and bad...Harri struck me as a person who was as kind as she was intelligent...*SPOILER BELOW*..[Make that she HAD been intelligent, right up until the last part of the book. I SO dislike books where a detective (or detectives) goes off on his or her own, without telling anyone what they are doing or where they are going.🙄]..*END OF SPOILER*..Having said that, I felt the good outweighed the bad, and I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, called Fall!!",🙄
endofthesentence,"Wonderful book, I love all of Mary Alice Monroe's book and this was no exception.",
Great,"I really loved this book. The way that the author described the main character transforming into a beautiful butterfly, and flying off into the sunset was incredible...Also, the fight scenes with the ninjas were incredible.",
Contains more errors than any other book,Great book which will pay for itself,
You think you know ... but you don't,"Love this author.  He makes me feel like I'm there. Love the main character. Smart, daring, no-nonsense. I'm addicted to British detective novels and this was right up there on favorites",
Can beauty rise from ashes?,"Well written, easy to read and follow, and emotionally raw, this novel digs deep into the lasting trauma and scars of a painful past. Kaitlyn skillfully connects us into the MC’s thoughts as he struggles to deal with demons that have haunted him for years. Can he come to terms and open up his heart to a girl who needs him? It’s a story of camaraderie born of heartache and tragic circumstances set in a world much like our own, yet so strangely different..Please note: The themes discussed are most suitable for adult readers, and I received a review copy of this book.",
Best calendar ever if you love Malinois!,I loved every photo. I whose I COULD get in ever year! I hope you will have one up for sale this year. I knows a whole lot of people that would be interested I purchasing one.,
Visionary Science Fiction,"Most of this novel concerns the fate of a cryonically frozen head of an upper class lady. Along the way David Marusek introduces us to the future, circa 2130. It is amazing and dazzyling indeed. David writes in a style that seems to transport the reader to this future, visionary in the utmost, an apparent roadmap to this future age with it's near magical technology, including rejuvenation science, ubiquitous holograms, advanced A.I., clones, nanotech, and much more. I found this book to be a page-turner, and very realistic, these to me are hard to find. And this is the first novel by Marusek at that! The overall plot and character development were superb, and bear in mind that the ending does allow a sequel without any problem, if so, count me in...",

"Blather, pure blather","This book is shallow. Sure, it is an easy read, but I am not sure if I want to continue wasting my time. I am glad I borrowed it, and so happy I did not buy it...I am currently on page 122 (of 379), and there are numerous typos; very frustrating. On the second page of chapter one, the character is called West. I had to go back to the first page to read the names of the newly introduced characters to comprehend who this new character was. Oh, not a new character, but Wes spelled incorrectly. Again, very frustrating to read this book.",
Superb Book,Painters and the American West: The Anschutz Collection is a superb collection of painters of the American west..I purchased it because of the comprehensive inclusion of the major artists of this area of America and of an era which has past.,
More money but less content,Content is so less,
Good,enjoyed the book.  Was a quick read.Same old virgil Flowers working  with the usual group.,
A lovely book,This is a lovely book that helps you create a little chapel of contemplation.  This is a book that can be utilized by the whole family and encourages contemplation that creates a little &#34;chapel of the mind.&#34;  Highly recommended.,

Really good read! Read it all in one day because I couldn’t put it down!,Goes to show you really don’t know people. Chilling because of the realism. I love the details of the individuals lives and how they are able to tell the story from multiple perspectives.,
Breath of fresh air,"I picked this book up recently and absolutely devoured it. The characters are very well written.  The town is painted so realistically, I feel like I've been there.  I love the history of Serenity Falls, and the story within a story...I've always enjoyed Moore's books, but this series is quickly becoming my favorite...I have the second book, The Pack, up next, and I am more than ready to get started on it.  Highly recommend this book, it's a great little world to get lost in.",
Truly helpful,Comprehensive and genuinely useful. This is the best book on log I've seen yet.,
Didn't feel a connection with the characters,"This continues the story from Secret Angel, and doesn’t really work as a stand-alone, as there are.a lot of references to the backstory, and there isn’t much history given in this story. It would have.been much better if the two had just been combined into one book...I didn’t feel much of an attachment to any of the characters. They could have more depth, and.the dialogue didn’t really seem like it flowed well either...The whole idea in both stories, of a former rock star moving to a tiny town, in search of a better,.more meaningful life, is a good one. I just felt there was something lacking in the story. It needs.more emotional depth. It is a short, quick read, and I highly recommend that Secret Angel be.prior to reading this one.",

good siblings story - 1980s vibe,"ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:  An epic party to celebrate the end of summer changes the lives of many...BRIEF REVIEW:  Malibu Rising tells the story of the four Riva siblings: Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit and their parents June and Mick.  Mick was a famous singer who fell in love with June, the daughter of The Costas who owned fish & chips joint in town in 1956.  Through flashbacks we learn much about their rocky relationship and life together how it affected the lives of their four children through the lead up of the big end-of-summer bash on August 27, 1983, that gets out of control and ends in disaster...A love a good family saga and think this one has that feel. This is definitely a character driven story and the author does a great job letting the reader get to know each of the Riva siblings and to and lesser degree, parents June and Mick. I loved the strong sibling ties. By far, Nina was my favorite character, a gorgeous model, fabulous surfer but someone who with a sense of responsibility to others and someone who  put the needs of others above her own. I liked June and Riva's story and that invincible feeling when young and in love that sometimes makes one overlook the obvious. I liked the Malibu beach scene and the 1980s vibes: the sun, the surf, the music and the fancy free lifestyle. My least favorite aspects of this story was the details of the rich and entitled party attendees who seemed to do everything in excess. There was plenty of booze, drugs and sex in this novel as well. Overall I liked this story even though some parts were overdone...This is my second novel by this author, Daisy Jones and the Six was my first and one I enjoyed.  I gather that Mick Riva was one of the husbands in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo but I haven't read that one yet...RATING:  4/5..Thanks go to Random House Audio for allowing me access to this book in exchange for my unbiased review. The audiobook was read by Julia Whelan who did a great job.",
"Great read, deceptive description","Scarrow is an excellent author an this story is the best yet.  It has everything you would want in a yarn about the Roman Legion.  So why did I give it only 3 stars?  Because of the way the publisher described this book on Amazon.  The initial title states that this book is one of a series of &#34;Novellas.&#34;  However, in the description, this book is listed as being 300 pages long and it doesn't even break 100 pages. That to me is outright deception.  I complained to Amazon and they gave me a refund even though it was a Kindle purchase.  Please be aware that you are NOT buying an entire book, no matter what the description says.",
Inspiring,Beautiful images,
"Vandana Singh is the standout, the rest failed to impress","I am a great fan of time travel stories, so this immense tome ought to be right up my alley, but it failed to impress. I'm surprised by the absence of Poul Anderson (either a Time Patrol or anything else); there was not a single story which captured the in-depth historical background he brings to his writing, and far too few which had any emotional resonance. The volume did introduce me to Vandana Singh, however, and I plan to look up more works from her in the future.",
Overview and Introduction,The book skims over the subject matter and only introduces the material enough that an interested student can figure out where to go next for more information.  The language is correct but cumbersome and can not be read quickly.  This seems to be partly due the meat of the subject but also due to many awkward sentences. Acceptable text book.,
many mis-spelled words throughout,I just know what I wanted to use it for but.I am not using it,
Crossroads Audio Book,"This is a Great audio book! The narrator has an enjoyable voice to listen to and puts emphasis for each character ..I have listened to it at least 20 times, and find it flows well and keeps my interest. Highly recommend!",
"Skip the book, see the movie","I saw the moview 1st, then wanted to know more, so I bought the book. The book is horrible. It is obvious (now) that the screen writer took the best ideas from the book, changed the story, eliminated the garbage and created a great story...The moview is a much better story.",
Survival Guide,"New to the CVICU and ICU in general and this book has been my saving grace while orienting to CVICU. It is easier to understand certain concepts with certain body systems and it has helped clarified information provided by other Nursing ICU/CVICU materials. Would recommend this book for experienced nurses, and maybe new graduates, who need certain concepts broken down a little better, but not in such a way that make it feel simple. The topics explored in this book are heavy and complex but the information is not the bare minimum.",

The Dark Monk was Okay,The Dark Monk was a fast read! I thought that it was just okay in comparison to The Hangmans Daughter.

"Suitable for beginners, most helpful for intermediate users","I'm a beginner at Photoshop, and my partner is good enough that he can generally figure out how to do anything he wants to do with it, but maybe not in the most efficient way possible...As a beginner, I found the book extremely helpful in providing screenshots of the steps involved in each tutorial...The books takes a non-linear approach to teaching, taking you through projects and techniques rather than taking you through each boring beginner thing in sequence. Both of us preferred this way of learning because it kept us engaged and excited about learning the next new thing. Neither of us wanted to skim over parts of this book...I was impressed because it took me from knowing pretty much nothing to feeling about to do a few things in a short amount of time. My partner was thrilled that even after years of using Photoshop, he learned a number of more efficient ways of doing things and some cool new tricks...This book has been in high demand in our home, which says a lot about its usefulness, because we are at very different stages of using Photoshop...I'd recommend it highly. It's easy to understand and laid out in a way that keeps the book fresh and avoids feeling like a boring textbook.",

Review: Siren's Storm,"his is one of those books that I really wish I could give it a higher rating.  I really liked parts of it.  But, there's always that one things that hold it back.  And really, for me a 3 isn't a bad rating.  It's just that I think there are better books out there...I felt like I didn't really connect with Will.  At times, I felt like his character was all over the place.  Granted with the tragedy in his past, I kind of understand.  Especially when you factor in the idea that he has no idea what happened.  He also has a lot on his plate dealing with his best friend, Gretchen.  Her sleepwalking habits often left me agitated.  Her obsession with Asia also felt forced.  She just sort of shows up in town and he can't help but wonder about her.  I also wanted to him to wake up and see what his obsession was doing to Gretchen... I really did enjoy the mermaid/siren folklore in this story.  It includes the story of Calypso, and her obsession with Odysseus.  When he left her, she was overcome with need for revenge.  It was an interesting twist to the story.  I enjoyed Asia's connections with Calypso and what she's required to do...For some reason, I found the overall story extremely slow moving.  It felt like there was hardly any action to drive the story forward.  It wasn't until Asia tells Will the complete story of who and what she is that the story felt like it was going anywhere.  And then it was over.  It left me with some unanswered questions and the thought that there will be a sequel.",
IMPRESSIVE!,What a great collection of short stories!  An impressive roster of authors and a fantastic array of stories!  Don't miss it!,
Fabulous,Loved it. Enough twists and turns to distinguish itself from the slew of YA fantasy novels and a heroine that's as feisty as she is kind.  Win.,
Very good book !!!!,"Th Hope Factory is a very good book. I feel it accurately depicts life in modern India.My husband travels to that area in India all the time on business and yes the automotive industry and the book accurately reflects what he has seen. The book is very well written and the characters very well developed. The book is about two different families, one the Calvery Auto  factory owner and his quest to obtain more acreage to expand his factory and that of his wife's maid and her struggle to obtain a quality education for her gifted son. It is an interesting story , and very hard to put down . I would recommend you read it if you are at all interested in India it is an excellent story a little rough in a few spots, sex and language if that bothers you.",

Historical Romance Novel Set In The 1800s,"I loved theme of the novel being set in England in the 1800s with the lead character being a young female, Celeste Ashton, whose is strong, independent, intelligent and curious about the world around her...Celeste lives along the English coast, enjoys being in and around the ocean in general. She encounters dolphins in the cove next to her home and becomes close with them and is able to study dolphin behavior, which then leads Celeste to write a book about her scientific studies of dolphin behavior...The book she writes becomes a success with popular society, but not within the scientific community itself! A professor of ichthyology, named Titus Thorne, spends two weeks to study if what Miss Ashton has written is really true!! He is out to debunk her book as a total hoax...Does he prove her wrong? You'll have to read for yourself! I found this overall plot/storyline was phenomenal and captivating...What I didn't like where some of the minor characters in the novel like Celeste's irritating Nana and her elderly cohorts! There behavior in the novel was annoying at every turn. I didn't like a lot of the other minor characters as well. Plus Professor Titus Thorne seems way too rigid for a man of his age!..Some of the plot details were surprising and fun, while others weren't so great and detracted from the novel itself!",
Theoretical and dry,Do I need to say more... Very repetitive. Has some good concepts but lot of dry theory. I should have known when the title had such words like Holy Grail and Financial Freedom.,
Great Recipes,"I got this book for my sister who really doesn't like to cook.  But the recipes in this book are so easy that she's told me she refers to it all  the time.  She has a large family so it's perfect for her.  I looked through it and liked it also, so I bought three other books from the Contessa.  I recommend all her books.",
Great toddler book!,My 2 year old fav book! He lovessss it so much!,
Do love it...,Wanted this for Christmas last year but as it was out of print and my children all assumed I wanted a hardbound edition they did not buy it. I did... and thoroughly enjoyed it.,
This book is awful to read from,"I think this book is poorly written, but I had to get it for class unfortunately.",
Great job reading by Jim Dale,"This is a review of the Unabridged Audio CD of book 1.  Amazingly, my review will be number 4594!  I have never seen a book get 1000 reviews..I had never seen the movie or read the book but my 25 year old son told me he feels this book should be required reading in school.  Just got back from driving the family on a vacation and it was fun listening to Jim Dale read this book.  I think this is the same song and dance Jim Dale that played Doc Terminus so wonderfully in Petes Dragon..What a great adventure it was to hear Dale, a veteran broadway actor read this book with the accents and passion with which he delivered the story..This books comes on 7 CDs and covered the drive from Tampa to Biloxi perfectly.  So if you have a 10 hour drive ahead of you, consider obtaining the audio version of this book.",
Red and Digger,I love Rex and Digger... I just wish the stories had a little more action.  The villains are random but Luciana was a fun character that I would want in future books.  Disappointed at the abrupt and partially sad ending but this is a series I enjoy reading.,
How,A couple of weeks ago this item had a release date so I added it to my wish list.  Now you posted ...&#34;Not sure when this item will be back in stock.&#34; when it never made it into stock!!!!!,
Not his best work,Good book but not the best I've read from this author. He may be targeting teens or newbies to the genre. I had hoped this would be as good as Enchantment.,
Lots of suspense and action in a very primitive language,Maybe some people behave like this but they certainly don't talk like this.,
Five Stars,The original story is very good in its own right. I wish it were longer.,
Ava Armstrong is a great author!,"This was my first book by author Ava Armstrong. I am so glad that I tried one of her books! The Dark Horse Guardian series describes the exploits and real life adventures of US Navy SEALS told in a way that shows the bravery as well as the humanity of these special men and their families. Fascinating material! I will now be moving forward to read the rest of this exciting series. Great job, Ava!👍",👍
Love it,"This case is instantly my favorite phone case ever.  I am a soccer fan, a soccer coach , and love to play soccer with my kids.  This case exemplifies the love of the game.  It shows my personality, my passion, and what I care about without saying a word.  It has been an awesome conversation piece every time I take out my case.  All of my soccer friends are jealous and want to know where to get one...In terms of how well the case functions, I am obviously most impressed with the look of the case.  This case provides very decent protection for ever day use.  It has a rubber bumper that surrounds the edges which wraps to the front and around the back of the phone.  The back of the case is a hard plastic that snaps onto the bumper about where the phones glass would be.  All of the buttons on the phone function perfectly.  The openings for the lightning cable, headphones, mic and speakers do not interfere with the function of any of them.  Cords fit without the case needing to be removed.  With phone cases, I think everyone will want different needs met.  My first need was looks with adequate protection.  I wouldn't use this case around the pool or out on the beach but I would use it for most of my every day needs...I received a discount for my honest and unbiased review of this phone case.  For obvious fan reasons, I am more than completely satisfied.  I love this case and it works great.",
3.5-4 stars: Good Overall; One Dud in the Mix,"Traditional Regency anthology. Note: Traditional Regency means no sexytimes (well, except Mary Balogh's - see below)...** ""Under the Kissing Bough"" by Sandra Heath - 2.5-3 stars. Pretty standard Regency fare. Country gentry down on their luck has to move out of their manor home into a cottage. The new owner is a London gentleman who spots one of the daughters when she sneaks onto the estate to collect some greenery to use as Christmas decorations. He takes an immediate interest in her and asks for her help in decorating the manor home for the holidays. Really, no big surprises, no complex characters. Possibly the most interesting character is the villainess, with whom the H, Sir Philip, was once in love...** ""Season of Joy"" by Gayle Buck - 3 stars. Sweet second chance romance/engagement story. A betrothed couple have a misunderstanding when H spots h hugging her longtime MALE best friend before said best friend heads off to the Peninsula to fight in the war. They have a confrontation, and H storms off and decides to join the fighting on the Peninsula, as well (it's not written as hotheaded as it sounds). He writes a letter to h that essentially gives her the okay to jilt him. Instead, she writes him back, and they thus begin a correspondence over the year. Story picks back up when it's Christmas Eve, and H returns to h's family's estate. I would say 3.5-ish, but the last line is definitely a 1-star hokey *cringe*-worthy mess. I know that sounds judgmental, but seriously, when these stories are so short, every paragraph counts...** ""The Viscount and the Hoyden"" by Laura Matthews - 2 stars. I read this story once, years ago. Came away with a bland and blah feeling that henceforth has made me skip this story every year when I bring this anthology out to reread around the holidays. Viscount's mother used to visit somewhere out in the country every year and would come back to tell him stories of this young hoydenish girl. He was enchanted by these tales and envious of her carefree upbringing (he was an only child, if I remember correctly). He visits the country estate with the idea of wooing her. Pretty meh overall. Definitely skippable, in my eyes...** ""The Christmas Mouse"" by Emily Hendrickson - 4 stars. I really really liked this one. It's a sweet story about a young woman who has unexpectedly inherited a country ""cottage."" Only when she goes to the cottage, she sees it's actually an estate. With a manor house. And hundreds of acres of land. And tenant cottages. Oh, and a handsome estate manager by the name of Charles Dane. *wiggles eyebrows*..Amanda, who had up til then been living with her brother and his wife as their unofficial (and unpaid) governess/nanny/tutor/poor relation, has always been retiring in her ways and quite shy around men, so she's quite pleased with the ease with which she can converse and keep company with Mr. Dane. Not only does this story present a sweet wallflower/beta romance, but it also is a bit of a coming of age story as Amanda learns to assert herself a bit and go after what she wants. The central conflict arises when Charlie realizes Amanda is quite an heiress, and he doesn't want her to think he's some kind of fortune hunter...** ""No Room at the Inn"" by Mary Balogh - 3.5 stars. A good story with a cast of characters that are stranded at an inn in a snow/ice/winter storm. A poor couple is also seeking shelter at the inn - in the stables, at that. She's pregnant, and the main action revolves around her going into labor...There are two couples whose romances are featured in this story: (1) an aristocratic married couple on their way to a house party and (2) a rakish marquess on his way to a debaucherous house party and a governess on her way to visit her family. The married couple has been unhappily married for three years, but each loves the other (if only they knew it). He thinks she doesn't need him and is happier with her ton friends than with his own company, while she has tried to be independent all this time because she hasn't wanted to be a burden on him, etc. She knows he keeps a mistress and doesn't understand why he brings his love to another; he keeps said mistress because he doesn't want to subject his wife to his base needs, etc. Basically, false assumptions have nudged them apart over the years until they just can't confront each other or put a finger on what exactly is wrong. I'm not explaining this well, but I really liked this couple. As you'd expect from Mary Balogh, she actually has a love scene in her short story between this couple...it's passionate and emotional. Very well done...What drags this story down is the second couple - the more traditional Regency-type relationship of a rake and a governess. I just found this couple flat out unbelievable. There's too much going on in the narrative for us to get any handle on either of their POVs for why they would fall in love with each other after being stranded together for two days. I think this story would have been much better served if it only focused on the married couple.",
Windows 8.1 for Dummies,"I got this in anticipation of getting a new computer with Windows 8.1. Since I haven't had any exposure to this new system, I thought I might need help. This book lays the ground work for me to get started so that I feel comfortable with setting everything up the way I want it.",
Best Coverstitch reference!,There are not so many books covering the coverstitch machine.  This is really helpful and easy to understand with many illustrations.  This is the best book I've seen.,
The Man Who Flies With Birds.,"I am a Canada Geese fanatic, in fact, I wrote an article about them believing they should run the country! With this fascination, I went to my library to find more information about these magical creatures only to find there were no books on the subject (in my library). The Librarian kindly sent me to other books regarding birds and I found The Man Who Flies With Birds in the children's department. I thought it looked interesting and today, started to read it. I couldn't put it down - not since Harry Potter, another supposedly children's book, has anything grabbed my attention. Exquisite photography indeed and the written words were poetic in their scientific genre (don't you hate that word - just couldn't of another one). I was so entranced that I couldn't stop talking about it to my other half - every time I read a paragraph, I had something else to say. He is not a book reader - more of intelligent magazines and The Irish Times - so it was with some amazement that he agreed to take a look. HOOKED! I am ordering it now from Amazon - where else? - so I can have it in my possession before I return the copy I have to the library. I am not even into aviation, have a phobia about birds but am almost hypnotised by them. I was having a conversation some years ago with a man who was interested in retaining my services for a very prestigious conference when three Bald Eagles flew over the lake where we were discussing the event. For as long as the Eagles were there, I was transfixed. He talked - I didn't hear a word. This is exactly how I felt after the very first page of The Man Who Flies With Birds. Exciting, informative, unique and courageous. Not only that, this book and the work researched, saves lives. It is so topical with recent events of crashes due to birds flying into planes. I am always entranced with creativity and this is beyond the norm. Yossi Leshem is a genius. Whilst writing this, my 'to be' 9 year old grandson is to have his birthday in February so I believe I am to purchase two copies - he isn't getting mine. This is a forever in my library book. I am in my 80th year - obviously this book crosses the age perimetres. So, mind the gap and buy the book. I am going to recommend it to my family in the UK and Ireland. They have Amazon there too. Really, I just can't get over this book. Did I give you that impression? It's sensational - really. Would I lie to the great Amazon public. Dr. Yvonne Kaye.",
What's not to like?,"The art is precious, it is fun to read, and the cake recipe is easy and delicious.  My five year old loves this book, and we finally got around to baking and eating the cake recently.  Yum!",
MUST HAVE Resource for New Puppy,Excellent book! This covers everything we need to know about getting our new corgi puppy :).Thank you so much Zak George! We also LOVE your youtube videos and your enthusiasm! My girlfriend and I have learned so much from your book and watching your videos,
funny cat,all good,
Smaller than expected,"The book is nice but for the price point, I assumed the book would be a regular size. It's more like a pocket size but it's ok. It still looks pretty",
Great book!,Great book! Quick ship,
Five Stars,Great Book!,
Five Stars,Great book!,
You MUST read this book,I LOVE this book. I discovered it after doing a devotional on my YouVersion app based on this book. Highly recommend for anyone that can be prone to toxic thoughts. The author explains things in such an easy to understand but powerful way. The quality of the book is great and it shipped quickly!,
This is a very good book,I liked this book because it teaches kids that even when you dislike one of your siblings you will still love them because they are your family.,
Informative book,"Examples of research studies, statistics to help patients understand risks, information on dosages and best medications to use for different populations.  Excellent seller, speedy delivery.",
Love it!,This book taught me what two others could not!,
Georgeous,"I love this book nothing like the paper dolls were back in my day, this one is so pretty with glitter on the clothes.  The only thing is that all have to carefully cut out so a grown up may need to help.  You have 6 dolls and can use the skin tone like your self, white or dark and they all just as beautiful as the next.  The little flower girl and ring barrier are so cute.  The brides have a lot of different changes of her wardrobe.  I just love this and it bring back so many memories as when I was a little girl. Wish you could click on the pages of the book and see the details.  Going to play with these with my great-granddaughter we will have a ball.  Thanks to. Tracy McDonald, Customer Care Specialist of Dover Publications.com for sending me this book for my honest review.",
It was ok,"It was ok, but I expected more",
Absolutely soulful!,"What a soulful book.  I laughed.  I cried.  And I learned some philosophy from a dog.  Yes, a dog...I have to admit, when I realized that the main character in the book was Enzo the dog, and that it all takes place from his point of view, I wondered if the story would really maintain my interest.  I needn’t have worried.  It did!..Enzo is a philosopher with a worldview shaped by lots of TV, movies about car racing and the love and protection of his owner, Denny.  (The love and protection is definitely reciprocated!)  Enzo is both naïve and wise and hoping in his next life to be a human with the ability to speak and to use opposable thumbs.  After living inside Enzo’s head, I think he’s ready.  I think he should graduate.  He’d be a human I’d like to know...There were so many quotable quotes in this book, so many bits of philosophy that I just loved.  Here’s one of my favorites:..“But my thoughts turned to what [Denny] had just taught me.  Such a simple concept, yet so true:  that which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our destiny.  Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.”..I’m torn with whether to call this book a pleasant read.  I somehow don’t think “pleasant” applies as there are some really tough times that Denny and Enzo go through.  On the other hand, as I finished the book and tried to think what to say about it, I was steeped in satisfaction with the arc of the story and I will miss Enzo.  I want to drop my hand toward the floor and feel him nuzzle it.  So maybe pleasant is the right word...Kudos to the author for making me care so much about the “people” in this story – and yes, I include Enzo in that term.  I recommend this book to anybody who wants to see the world through the big brown eyes of simplicity and love.",
It is supposed to be great  But...,I do not know.. I am having a hard time with the narrator's pace and her voice . After the first part just  to be fair I started over .  I'm giving it another chance and going back to beginning ..  Still not sure if I'm wasting my time.  I read and write a lot  But at this point I'm going to say  not so good so far .and give it up.,
Great book for kids!,"We got this book after first buying &#34;Falling for Rapunzel&#34;. They are so cute and witty, they're even fun for us to read to the kids so bedtime stories aren't quite as tedious.",
These books are so well worth the money,"I want to own the whole lot of them.  They are well thought out and of high quality in both content and production.  My 11 year old son has learned more about Einstein than most people from reading the 30 second Theories book.  Wonderful, every household should have a set!",
Book,Excellent Product. #####,
An alright read,"I have never read Rob Thurman before, and after reading this book, I'm not really sure if I'll be reading anything else by her. I would say that this book is about a 3.5, it was a good read, definitely plenty of action and excitement, it just wasn't anything spectacular. This book sorta read like an overly packed action movie. Jackson is a guy with a loaded and trouble past which has left him bitter, scorned and resentful. But that is all there is to him. That's it. I can see the hurt from his past, and yes his snarky comments made me laugh half of the time, but the other half they just annoyed me. The rest of the characters really didn't make an impression on me either. They all felt two dimensional. Yes this book had good plot, but without a strong build of characters your story really falls flat. I will say that I was surprised at the end and the mystery of the killer was not someone that I would have chose, but maybe if I thought hard about it it would seem obvious...anyway, maybe next time I read one of her books I'll loan it from the library..",
Quick Read,Very nice book. I’m always interested in anything Everest or the surrounding area. I’ll have to try some of his other books!,
"Yummy, but NOT fast!","I've enjoyed everything I've made from this cookbook. The recipes are full of spices and fresh herbs and I have to say, they're really good. But they definitely aren't fast. And not cheap either. My grocery bill was really high when I cooked dinners from this cookbook exclusively. Now I cook one or two meals from this book each week, and it's much more reasonable for my wallet and my time. They are good recipes though! And I learned a few tricks in the front section that I always use, like roasting nuts before putting them in a recipe. Yummy!",
Lourdes is super!,"This is the perfect book for children who have parents from Central or South America and North America.  It is so effective in showing them why they are so special to be children whose parents come from different ""worlds"".",
Good not great,"I was worried at the start that this would be too YA for me but despite it's YA moments (AKA ""mom loves Johnny more"") it's a very interesting book.  Describing how life changes as the world comes to an end through a journal really brought the story home.  It seemed a bit strange that everyone was taking it so well at the beginning and even days after it happened there wasn't mass panic.  That seemed a bit unrealistic to me but otherwise I think it was a very good tale.  The rest of the books might not at the top of my ""to read"" list but the rest of they are definitely on it!",
Great First Reader!,This book will always have a place in my heart as it is the 1st book I learned to read by myself!.Am so glad it is in print to share with my grandchildren as they are learning to read!,
There are many better 'art history' books.,"""The History of Art"" by Janson Used by Rice U. (cheap used). ""Art History"" by Gardner used by S.F.Art inst. either one is 100 times better. Bought this looking for something new/inspiration. It is okay, not any full page color plates. It was not inspirational.",
Good book,Read it again and again.,
Another awesome book! A must buy!,"To be honest I just got the book today. Somehow I got the book early at a Christian bookstore. I don't know how but I thank God for providing. I have not read this book, but instead have glanced through it and as well read pieces of the books. I must say it is as good as Vintage Jesus in giving us a practical but deep Biblical understanding into matter. This book goes through how to be a loving church, to being a missional church. If you got Church Leadership by Mark and you liked it. You are going to love this book. It takes that book and expounds greatly into things and adds new things that anyone who has a passion for the church and church planting would and should devour. This is a great book and I can't wait to read this thing cover to cover...Plus if Mark Driscoll is reading this thanks for letting God use you.",
A Small But Happy Mini-Calendar,A really happy calendar.  Every year I order one to record all of the birthdays and anniversaries in my large family.  This one hangs on my bathroom wall.  Mary Engelbreit is a talented artist!,
Fun story,I don’t usually read romance novels but did enjoy this. The mystery part of the story was well written. I didn’t expect the culprits till almost the end. Fun read.,
"Convoluted, murky story with stilted writing","I could only read half of the book.  When she spent a very long chapter on the back story of a casual acquaintance of the grandfather of the protagonist, I felt the author was undisciplined in controlling her story.  Yes, there are flashes of eloquent prose.  But the story is herky jerky and she gets sidelined and off on a tangent far too frequently.  As she matures as an author I expect this problem to dissipate.  But this book is just a poor first attempt by a budding young author.",
One Star,"Horrible, Blasphemous, Filthy, and Disgusting. DO NOT BUY!!!",
Fascinating character and engaging story,"I really enjoyed this audio book. The narrator is excellent. The story is easy to stay engaged in and follow. I found the character fascinating and the tie in to many characters that are canon, to be well integrated...I wish this book was canonized and that if Disney decides to add to this character, that they consider using this book as a good reference and try to incorporate as much of this into canon as possible.",
Way underpriced for how cute it is!!,This was so cheap so I didn’t have high expectations but it’s AMAZING! The stickers can be removed and replaced without tearing or tearing the pages of the book. My 3 and 6 year olds have had an absolute blast with these and they actually create beautiful pictures! Great for long car rides!,
An Almost Excellent Boston Guide!,"The Frommers's Guide to Boston and it's surrounding area is quite useful, informational, and ideal for those coming to Boston for the first time or hundredth time. Boston is very historic, enlightening, and a worldly city. The book is done well but it can be done better for those of us who would like to know Boston and it's neighborhood...Boston has attracted all kinds of people like Julia Child who is missing from the text. She was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I wished that she was written more about here. She remained in Cambridge for decades even with the success of her shows and books. Cambridge has also attracted actor John Malkovich as well in recent years as well as other famous and notable residents. In Julia's book, she decided with her husband to settle in Cambridge after they returned from Europe. I wished the book would have acknowledged Julia Child's contributions to American cuisine, television history, and American culture...I also wished the book mentioned Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts as well but it doesn't. There are lot of important facts and information about Boston that isn't here. I loved the film section about what films in recent years especially ""The Fighter"" in Lowell and other notable films...I liked the book's acknowledgement of cemeteries where famous Americans such as Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and others have been interred. Boston is about American history as well as about sports. I visited Boston when Ted William died around 4th of July and he was honored with the flag at half staff at the Capital building. He was an American baseball legend and a beloved Boston Red Sox player...We stayed at a Doubletree hotel near JFK/Massachusetts General area. The book is almost excellent and could use some constructive and positive criticism. I also think the book could have done more on Cape Cod for day trips. Still, you won't be disappointed with this guidebook.",
Allan Kardec un hombre eminente y espiritual,"Historica biografía de Allan Kardec, codificador del Espiritismo Ciéntifico. Un Maestro humilde y altruísta; que sufrió la persecución del clero, los ateístas y los charlatanes..Refleja su sacrificada vida en pos de su doctrina espiritual y los escollos que tuvó que superar, que le acortarón su existencia. Su divisa era que sin la Caridad Cristiana no hay salvación. Y le daba más importancia al estudio ciéntifico y el amor por el prójimo que a la práctica efímera de la mediumnidad como un método de mera curiosidad y explotación egoísta.  Enfatizaba la moralidad, la oración y la fraternidad Universal.",

I buy this calendar every year!,"I had a hard time finding this in the mall that Christmas, so was excited to find it available on Amazon.  I've bought this calendar for my Grandmother every year for X-mas for as far back as I remember.  Classic, cute and she loves it!!",
A stunning tale of a woman's journey to a better life while maintaining her intolerance of the social injustices of her htime,"One reason I gave the rating is because there were so many ""keepers,""sentences and passages that grabbed me because they articulated truisms in a way I hadn't thought of before. The story is a good one. Ready the NYT review",
Lots and lots of problems,"There are other, and much better, Armstrong biographies out there. This one reads and feels as though it was rushed to press immediately after the astronaut's death, and is absolutely full of inaccuracies. Other reviewers have noted some of these, but I was stunned to see Nikolai Kamanin, a senior figure in the Soviet space program, referred to as 'Lev Kamanin' both in the text and the index. It's a sloppy piece of work, in need of serious editing; there are dozens of problems with commas, leaving the text difficult to read, almost as though, in places, it was dictated into Dragon. Pass on this and read 'First Man' instead.",
Five Stars,These coloring books are great. Simple and great.,
Five Stars,Perfect.,
Familiar places,"Mr. Gaines writes aboout places and people who my family readily recognizes. We are first generation Californians and our family base is in Louisiana. All the places,faces and social situations are so familiar that  in my lit class I was able to answer questions from other students.  This  book is wonderful reading. If you want a sense of Louisiana without the  travel time, read anything written by Ernest Gaines.",

This one pays beautiful homage to the Alice Network.,"What I Didn’t Like:.-Charlie’s chapters. They felt almost repetitive and unnecessarily fluffy. I suppose they exist mostly to break up the heaviness of the topics addressed in the rest of the book, which is important, but they just don’t give the same sense of urgency and excitement as Eve’s chapters..-The math “equations” forced on everything. As an actual math geek myself, I can say it’s incredibly unlikely you’ll find us making statements like “me plus him minus morals equals …”. We tend to feel operations have weight and value, meaning we’re less likely to throw them around in ways they weren’t intended for. But maybe that’s just me. Either way, it annoyed me that Charlie kept doing this..-The ending. If you’ve been following my reviews for a while you know I’m the kind of reader who likes endings that don’t lay it all out for me and instead keep me thinking and guessing long after I finish the book. I realize I’m in the minority there. That being said, this final chapter (epilogue) felt unnecessary to me...What I Did Like:.-The historical research involved in this one added a wonderful sense of accuracy that this tale needed. The Alice network was real. Many of the women mentioned are based on real people and their real stories. This was an excellent retelling of their challenge, specifically Eve’s chapters. This is 100% of the reason this book is recommended by so many people and passed around so frequently. It’s an important part of history well researched and embedded..-High tension. Eve’s chapters ran with an intense sense of urgency that kept my interest and kept the story moving. I felt myself pulled to continue reading just to find out what happened next. She was captivating and compelling right from the first scene she popped into..-The romance side storyline worked. I don’t always say that and I definitely don’t think it was entirely necessary (not every story needs a romance) but this one works. It’s believable and it works for this story...Who Should Read This One:.-Historical fiction fans, specifically those who want something different from WWI or WWII fiction that already exists. This emphasis on the Alice Network makes this one refreshingly different from the rest of the offerings out there...My Rating: 4 Stars.Solidly researched historical fiction makes me happy.",

To the Land of No Homes,"Yes, that title is symbolic. This short novel can be read in a sitting. It takes a mock-medieval style to report, from alternating and eventually contrasting narrative voices, what happened on an episcopal mission commanded by the Pope to reclaim the Norse lapsed into heathenry in faraway Greenland...It's more of a conceit than a full-fledged work. Hester Velmans' translation may capture the starched, satirical, and savage qualities of the original French, but the effort feels fussy and overly stylized in English. So does the effort to which the author strains to capture the tone of a chronicle or correspondence, given the friction of the attempt to counter the wiles of the Inuit, here titled &#34;publicans,&#34; who lure the dwindling Norse into their seal-hunting, sexually suspect and sinful mores...A few good lines show the potential. Early on, frostbite claims victims on the bishop's ship. Having been forbidden to eat their own rotting flesh to survive, one shipmate rebels. &#34;One of them replied that the season was not Lent, and proceeded to devour his own toes.&#34; I admit I liked some of the dour and deadpan recitals of increasing woe, as the rescue attempt to scare and shame the Norse back to Christian fidelity, compared to the odd temptations of dissolute abandon among the natives, lure the Catholic contingent into their compromises, to survive in New Thule increasingly hostile threats.",
Five Stars,As always the dummies are very good and well written,
Five Stars,Great book and great series. I could not put them down.,
The Fear Index,"I was looking forward to reading this book. I wanted to like it. So, what went wrong? Maybe it was that I just finished [[ASIN:067002578X Syndrome E: A Novel]] which was fantastic. No, it was more than that. First, the protagonist isn't even remotely likeable. He's pretty much a douche - a brilliant douche - but a douche nonetheless...Brilliant, secretive physics whiz kid develops an artificial intelligence system which has an uncanny ability to predict financial markets. On top of that, the system has the ability to ""learn."" Have you figured out the ""big surprise"" plot twist yet? C'mon, everyone knows it. I knew what was going to happen when I was only a quarter of the way through. C'mon, I know you can guess it - ""no problemo.""",
Five Stars,great,
"Interesting historical setting, mildly intriguing characters","I'm always eager to find new historical mysteries, and especially series of same; but I'm not sure whether I'll read the next two books in this series (or however many have been translated so far)...I suspect that part of my problem lies with the translation, though there's no obvious problem with it. There's something about the progression from scene to scene that didn't quite work for me. I also found it very difficult to keep the characters straight -- even though the names of Danes, Saxons, and Vikings presumably had different origins, they were mostly unfamiliar (or only slightly familiar) and largely composed of vowels. . . ...I didn't dislike the narrator, but I did find his preoccupation with nubile young women a bit annoying at times. His sometimes deadly pragmatism did intrigue me, and I mostly enjoyed his sense of humor. As for Winston, the illuminator turned detective: I liked the idea that a habit of close attention to detail could be transferred from artistic to other uses, but there was something that didn't quite work for me about his transitions from one hypothesis to another...I did appreciate the chance to learn a little about an era in English history with which I was almost entirely unfamiliar. If I return to this series, that'll probably be why.",

Intercultural communication - the book,"This fantastic work is pretty much cross-cultural communication: the book. The beautiful (and beautifully illustrated/designed) story follows a bird and fish from intial cultural collision to eventual intercultural communication, highlighting both the adventures and the adversities that such explorers encounter.  I'm using this with my ESOL students - an absolutely beautiful book.",
Skips :(,The first CD is skipping. I literally took it out the package & put it into my CD player & it’s skipping on the first play. I haven’t gotten past the first show & I will change my review depending on if the rest of it skips &/or the second CD. This is very annoying. I had this CD before that I brought years ago but lost the second CD before I finished listening to the first. So I’m trying to learn Spanish before my trip in April & figured this would be the perfect thing to help so quickly.,
Great eBook!,Great formatting - fits the page on my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 tablet.  Text is sharp and scanned etchings are clear and impressive.  It was quite the enjoyable experience reading this version of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.,
great book,wish I have ordered it sooner. great for first time parents. It's hard cover which mean it will last a long time. Book is carefully categorized by age so easy to navigate to where I want to read (my son is 13 month old).,
Amazing read!,Amazing read! Captivated my mind. WARNING....don't read before bedtime or else you'll have insomnia! You won't put the book down so you'll stay up trying to read it...lol,
Five Stars,Mmmmm good,
Dirty Truth,This is the second book in the Irish Mafia series - it is a standalone but a highly recommend reading the first book Dirty Liar.  I think you get a better appreciation for this one after you've read the first.  Plus you get to fall in love with both Flynn brothers.  One on the wrong side of the law and one straight-laced lawyer.  But family is family and when you are called to step in you just do it.,
4 year old loves it,"My 4 year old really loves this book he laughs at the pigeon, however my 3 year old doesn’t care for it much maybe because he’s a tad bit younger. This is my 4 year olds favorite book",
Best cookbook I own!,"This is the ""Joy of Cooking"" for the next generation-not only does it give you the best way to make just about everything, it also provides variations and for those of you who are interested in the ""how"" of calling something the best recipe, it goes into wonderful detail of the process! Great technique descriptions and delicious recipes that are almost guaranteed to turn out perfectly-I highly recommend this book!",
Good read.,This book is surprisingly deep.  Excellent analogies.  I have a very short attention span and often don't finish books.  I've actually copied & pasted parts of it to share with friends.,

Great Product,In great shape and used in college.,
"Ridiculous, Frustrating, Worth Reading!","Yet another good, and quick read.  The Jack Reacher series continues to be entertain, even though his powers of deduction are borderline ridiculous, and his secrecy is frustrating.  This story is a little different from the previous 4, and the time line is a little cloudy (amount of time passing during drives and so forth), it's still worth reading.",
presents beautifully when colored,Christmas gift. Loved to expression of joy on her face as she opened it and the next morning when she displayed her first finished pages,
Floored by all the details in this book.,"This is by far, the best book on handloading that I ever read.  It is brim filled with timeless information, regarding ALL facets of.handloding (reloading).  Of course, any  Load Data  would be obsolete.  New manuals for newer powders.  Page after page, I.was treated to basics, as well as very fine detail, regarding this hobby.  He also describes some aspects, of factory ammunition production.  And many historical aspects of handloading.  Bottom line, U can not go wrong ordering this book.",
Amazon! Wake Up!,"Is this book a Joke? Not worth your time even though it is free. The ingredients list mixes liters and ounces. Then, the instructions are strange?.So frustrating to be interested in a recipe and have to convert the measurements. Now I guess the best thing for me to do is remove it from my Kindle.",
One of my favorite reads this year,"4.5 stars.I thought this book was a breath of fresh air as it's not the type of story I necessarily get to read very often. In some ways it is such a simple story but because the characters are complex as is their relationship, it just somehow works in an absolutely beautiful way.  I'm left feeling like this was just one of those good, rewarding reading experiences that only happens every once in awhile...Connell is smart, popular, and a football star at his high school.  Marianne is also smart but doesn't have any friends at school and gets picked on for her appearance as well as being labeled a mental case. Connell's mother cleans houses for a living and Marianne's family is one of her clients.  Connell often picks his mom up from work and that is how he gets to know Marianne better and develop an interesting connection to her.  But he definitely doesn't want the kids at school to know he has feelings for the outcast so he doesn't acknowledge Marianne at school or any other time except when they are alone.  And Marianne is okay with this.  The story alternates between the perspectives of Connell and Marianne and follows them over the course of a few years...Fair warning, Sally Rooney does not use quotation marks in her writing so if you think that might bother you when reading dialogue, maybe give this book a pass.  Personally, even though I don't see this writing technique used very often, it doesn't take me very long to adjust and get used to it...I read the author's other book, Conversations with Friends, a few years ago and enjoyed it but I liked this one even more.  Part of that can be due to the fact the characters in this book were far more likable, especially Marianne.  She is somebody who you wanted to be happy and you hurt when she hurt.  There is just something about these characters and their relationship that just spoke to me.  I really can't put it into words...I do recommend checking this one out but I will freely admit it's the type of book that you will either think is special or you will be left wondering why was there was so much hype.  As readers we bring our life experiences into every book we read so it makes sense we might not all gravitate towards the same stories. I personally loved this one though and am thankful I read it. Looking forward to reading more books by this author in the future.",
Five Stars,best writer ever,
Love mine,It is awesome love his work!,
Book,Very good,
One Star,I barely used this book for my Art History class. Sigh. I read one paragraph in total.,
From a Gliderman's Viewpoint,"There are not many ""first-hand accounts"" of the glider troopers in World War II but Fighting With The Screaming Eagles goes a long way to fill that void...Robert Bowen has as easy, natural style, which brings to light many of the unique challenges facing the glider forces.  First, they were not volunteers but were expected to perform at the same high combat level as paratroopers.  And that they did!..Second, they were delivered into combat in light, vulnerable, plywood gliders in a controlled crash landing that was considerably more dangerous than a parachute jump.  They didn't receive their special insignia and hazardous duty pay until July 1944...Bowen pulls no punches as he takes the reader through the rough training, the Atlantic crossing and how the 401st stubbornly clung to its unit identity after being assigned as the 1st Battalion of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR) of the 101st Airborne Division.  From there, his unit was in reserve to the 4th Infantry Division coming ashore on Utah Beach and the harrowing glider landings in Operation Market-Garden before being rushed to the Ardennes on the battle of the Bulge where Bowen was captured...His unique perspective as both a glider warrior and a POW make this book extremely interesting and informative.  Pictures, maps, a robust bibliography and a Roll of Honor for Company C, 401st round out this extraordinary book...Anyone interested in airborne operations in Word War II will love this book...John E. Nevola.Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II",
loving it,"I confess I've struggled with developing a gentleman attitude. When I first saw this book I was hopeful that my dreams of chivalry as a boy could be realized in adulthood.

Delightful!,Fantastic illustrations...great story line...very enjoyable read and view. The characters just jump out of the book at you. I loved it.,
Very interesting book,What a tragic end for a young woman who was born to wealth and loving maladjusted parents. Wasted lives and wasted wealth.,
Big doesn't mean Good!,"Quite dissappointed by the songs, since it introduces very early the high E note, which in my opinion is the hardest for elementary kids to execute properly. However, it sticks to the 78 songs with only six notes promise. The price printed on the face of the book says $7.95. At least erase it or cover it before advertising its $9.99 price as a great deal!!",$$
One Star,Not my cup of tea.,
Don't miss out!,"OMG! Now I've found another favorite author! I worry I'll have to come out of retirement to get all these new books I love. Luckily the great prices and entertainment provided makes it all worth it! Fantastic author, action packed book and superb prices make this o e of the best series ever. A must read!",
Good Read,We really enjoyed this book but a friend told me it reminded her of a story that had come out years before.,
Enjoyable enough,"*Warning: spoilers*..I am sad to say that I believe this is the weakest of the Redwall series.  It's not a matter of a familiar plot, but the weakness of the characters, the occasional overly-convenient event, and repetitive descriptions.  The Redwall elders are unusually harsh, particularly in the beginning of the book.  Their characters seem very flat, and any changes in their actions don't seem believable.  While I can accept the most overly-convenient events in a story I'm already suspending disbelief for, the badgers Salixa and Tabura came out of nowhere to fix Gorath's Bloodwrath.  Salixa in particular was ridiculously two-dimensional.  She was described as &#34;slender&#34; and &#34;gentle&#34; far too often to not be repetitive.  I felt like I'd fallen into a random love story that just happened to have an adventure and badgers...I enjoyed the book, and I certainly wouldn't steer younger or dedicated readers away from Eulalia.  The plot was a typical, interesting adventure.  It has its fun characters.  I specifically enjoyed Maudie.  It's an enjoyable story.  The writing just wasn't up to Jacques' normal standard.",
Excellent Audio Book for Children - Read by Author,"E.B. White's voice and performance of his words are grandfatherly and perfect.

A book I have been wanting to get for a while,Found this book from a bookstore a while ago and wanted to get this one for a while. Very comprehensive coverage of the dance history. Loved it!,
Like a gothic Alice in Wonderland,"Take a weak man whose life is pretty much in the control of the other people in his life, then throw him through the proverbial rabbit hole and into a ""through the looking glass"" version of the London tube system. Put his life in constant peril where he must use what wits he has about him to form alliances among a series of intrigues, the depth of which are wholly outside his grasp. This is the story of an unlikely protagonist, Richard Mayhew, who, like Alice in the Looking Glass, has to see an unfamiliar world with new eyes to survive the constant dangers that threaten him...In my opinion, this is one of the best books of the past two decades. The number of copies I have lost through loaning them out would support this opinion.",
Five Stars,Gave to grandson as a gift. He loves it!,
Disappointing,"This book struck me as very superficial. The author attempts to cover a very wide spectrum and, as a result, detail is sorely lacking. One example will suffice. The author describes the purpose of kudzu, ending with &quot;[I]f you like, you can also start kudzu while Red Hat Linux is running&quot; --- and fails to tell you how to start kudzu. Excuse me, but what's the point of failing to provide basic information?.The index is also very weak.On the whole, I think one can do much better than this book..Jerry",

Great collection,"What can I say. If you are a fan of &#34;The Magic Tree House books&#34; this is an amazing collection of narrated audio-books by no other than the author, Mary Pope Osborne herself. She does an amazing job. Can only highly recommend this product. Only downside is that the books does not follow the CD`s. The books just continue so it's hard to stop once you first start listening.",`
Best Cookbook!,"This is definitely my favorite cookbook. I am a fairly new vegetarian, and I wanted a cookbook that focused on healthy and delicious meals. These book does just that. It provides wonderful pictures (for those of us that would like to know what our meals are &#34;supposed&#34; to look like). She also gives a huge variety of recipes and tips. I highly recommend this book. It will be your go to cookbook for sure.",
The Ultimate In Warm Hearted Story Telling!!!,"Once again Brendan O'Carroll shows us why he is the master of truly warm hearted and loving story telling with a huge dose of comedy tossed in.

great life stories,top notch,
Four Stars,wonderful book,
A Pulitzer for this?,"At the risk of being hasty and rash, I could only take 20 pages, and read the book description to find no semblance of a promising plot ahead, or character conflict, and so I bailed.  I must agree with those who soldiered it out, left wondering, as I, about that Pulitzer.  Not the first time I have wondered about the Pulitzer.  The judges do turn to stone on occasion, as in here.",
Love the scary stories,A new TWO books to enjoy!  So happy to be reading a Terri Reid story again..I'm an old (too true) reader but Terri has helped me through more than a few rough patches in my life.  It's like  coming home to read her books.  Thank you Terri for filling the years (4) since I became a widow.,
Worth every Galleon!,"[[VIDEOID:2f366ad0920763d3bfcf2570a5c9d882]] I pre-ordered this for myself months ago. These are hands down the most beautiful and artistic versions of the Harry Potter book series. The quality is exceptional. I have three copies of the series (my old books from initial release, the complete red hardback copies with Hungarian horntail box, and now starting to collect these) and can confirm that these are truly the most elite version to date...Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima (MinaLima masterminds) created the graphic designs behind all the famous graphic elements of Harry Potter as seen in films. They created the famous letter from Hogwarts, the Marauders Map, Daily Prophet, the howler, the black family wallpaper, the wanted posters and so much more. I have grown up reading the books, watching the films and am beyond obsessed with the Wizard World. These books are so ornate and astonishing to someone who has reread the series multiple times, that it feels like I am reading the novels as a child for the first time. The book has several popup elements, beautiful color images, and more that make it such an interactive reading experience. From the high-quality hardback cover to each colored image, to the perfectly printed paragraphs, the work is phenomenal...Pros:.-Beautiful Green Hardback cover with gold foil details.-Thick sturdy pages.-Pop out panels for a more interactive experience.-High resolution vibrant colors throughout..Cons:.-Be mindful about the pop-up/interactive features around younger children, while this is very sturdy it can rip if mistreated..-doesn’t come in resealable plastic bag to protect it like the last book..A few Important Spells (with Immaculate Illustrations) mentioned in this:.-Oculus Reparo.-Immobulus.-Fera Verto.-Finite Incantatem.-Expelliarmus.-Everte Statum.-Serpensortia.-Vipera Evanesca.-Wingardium Leviosa.-Cistem Aperio.-Arania Exumai.-Obliviate..Overall: My videos and images do not do this justice! I would highly recommend this. I will be getting every version as it realizes on Amazon. I guarantee this will make the perfect gift and that this would make any Harry Potter fan, Hogwarts student or former Hogwarts alumni extremely happy!",
Dried out?,"None of this worked.  The paints were completely dried out.  The stickers didn't keep the paint where they should have.  The dotter is the best part.  I'll let you in on a secret - you can buy the dotter and look up patterns on YouTube or pinterest.  It is a really fun idea, it is poorly executed.",
Five Stars,One of my grandsons' favorite books - will make a great Christmas gift!,
World's longest running 'Best of' horror anthology!,"'Best New Horror' is now the longest running annual 'best of' horror anthology ever, beating the previous 22-volume record held for the past eighteen years by DAW Books for 'The Year's Best Horror Stories' (1971-1994). Although, in fairness to the industrious Ellen Datlow, she has - so far - edited an unbroken run of 25 annual 'best of' anthologies, twenty-one with St. Martin's Press and currently four with Night Shade Books. Of course, both have a ways to go yet to beat the mighty Gardner Dozois, who has edited a colossal 34 'best of' science fiction volumes since 1977, five with the publisher Dutton and, presently, twenty-nine editions of 'The Year's Best Science Fiction'...Last year 'Best New Horror' and Datlow's 'The Best Horror of the Year' overlapped by quite a few stories: this year none overlap. In fact, together with Paula Guran's 'The Year's Best Dark Fantasy & Horror', only one story is duplicated out of a total of 77, making this year a true embarrassment of riches...RAMSEY CAMPBELL leads off with ""Holding the Light"". Curiosity, a burning need to just know: the curse of youth, as young Tom and Lucas find out when they go exploring a local tunnel said to be haunted. As ever, Campbell's language is deceptively simple, the accumulative effect eerie, one of dread...Next up CHRISTOPHER FOWLER gives us a mischievous piece of whimsy, presented as the monologue of a patron of The Jack O'Lantern pub telling a new customer about the strange events that always seem to occur there throughout its history on All-Hallows Eve. Readers of Fowler's recent Hammer-homage horror novel 'Hell Train' will know just how delightfully sly he can be, and as with the best of tongue-in-cheek horror ""Lantern Jack"" still manages to give a nasty bite at the end...""Rag and Bone"" by PAUL KANE is classic Best New Horror. I heard once that, with the overwhelming number of stories he has to consider each year, editor Jones will often read the first few pages then skip to the last few: if the story ends up going in the direction he thought it was then what's the point? After many decades in the business he wants to be surprised. So no surprise, then, he picked Kane as this story of a scrap merchant - a rag and bone man - doesn't finish up where you think it will...""Some Kind of Light Shines from Your Face"" by GEMMA FILES is from the World Fantasy and British Fantasy Society Award-nominated 'Gutshot', an anthology of weird western stories edited by Conrad Williams. Western it certainly is, but it also involves Greek legends: a young woman joins two women in a travelling wagon, crossing the American dustbowl and scraping up a living by setting up tent and displaying their wares to grubby patrons eager to spend the little coin they have on catching a glimpse of the fair flesh and secret parts of comely women; to look on something fine to take their minds off their dry, barren existence. The women wear masks on stage, and when young Persia Leitner is eventually allowed to join them as well, a trinity is formed, and something happens... and old myths become new reality...""Midnight Flight"" by JOEL LANE is, as the author himself says in the introduction, ""a story about the loss of memory, and how memory might not want to be lost."" Concerning a man slowly recalling the title and details of a lost book from his childhood, whilst losing the identity of who he is now, the language very much recalls classic Ramsey Campbell in the author's claustrophobic depiction of misinterpretation and paranoia - and even manages to out-do Campbell in the closing page!..""But None Shall Sing for Me"" by GREGORY NICOLL is a piece of exotic horror set in the Caribbean and told from the point of view of a zombie. No, this isn't the knock about fun of Tim Powers' terrific `On Stranger Tides' novel, but an intense tale of closure and setting oneself free...Some of the best horror is the simplest, as demonstrated by ALISON LITTLEWOOD in ""About the Dark"". Three youths, Adam, Fuzz and Sasha, enter what is locally known as the Dark Cave. Through Sasha, we learn that there is a darkness in the cave, and not simply an absence of light. Many people have gone into the cave. Some never came back, their names written on the walls. Adam has recently started attending a new school, where he has reinvented himself from the bullied to a strong and disinterested figure who doesn't care about anything. Except he does. He cares about Sasha, but because of the newly created image of himself he doesn't show it and she goes with Fuzz instead, which annoys him greatly. Only once do all three enter the dark; thereafter Adam ventures alone and learns about the dark... and the names... and who puts them there. Understated, exact, and with an atmosphere that closes in on you. A frequent contributor to the UK's premiere horror fiction magazine, `Black Static' (wherein this story was first published; another story she had in the same magazine last year was reprinted by Ellen Datlow), Littlewood recently hit the UK bestseller lists with the publication of her well-received debut novel `A Cold Season'...In ""The Photographer's Tale"" by DANIEL MILLS Lowell's estranged apprentice, Patrick, sends him a camera. It's 1892 and this camera is the very latest model. It is also unique, as Lowell soon finds out. When looking through the lens it reveals not only what the subject will eventually look like in old age, but what secrets lie beneath their mask of make-up and outward personality. And once Lowell sees the truth, he sees it everywhere... even when no longer looking through the lens...""The Tower"" by MARK SAMUELS comes from his collection `The Man Who Collected Machen and Other Weird Tales'. In this deceptively simple story a man, disillusioned with the modern commercial world and the vapidity of its future he envisions ahead, begins seeing a fog-enshrouded tower, where there shouldn't be any, in the middle of the city of London. A symbolism, he believes, for where he's trying to go, what he has to become. The power of this tale lies in the telling, and is on a par with the measured surrealism of Thomas Ligotti. Both write fresh horror, but imbued with the disciplined style of old masters like M.R. James, Robert Aickman, Algernon Blackwood and, of course, Arthur Machen. This is his seventh appearance in `Best New Horror' since volume 15...Last year's ""Christmas with the Dead"" by Joe R. Lansdale was Best New Horror's knock-about story; this year PETER ATKINS picks up that mantel in the delightful and snappily written ""Dancing Like we're Dumb"". It sees the return of his detective character, Kitty Donnelly, in a short, breezy tale of gangsters dabbling in the supernatural. It starts off with Kitty being carjacked and kidnapped: her day just gets worse from there on out!..""An Indelible Stain Upon the Sky"" by SIMON STRANTZAS is an emotionally complex story, allegorical, symbolic and thick with meaning and portent: Port McCarthy, once beautiful, is a damaged town, wrecked by an oil tanker spill. Our narrator and his wife Suzanne, once filled with hope and love, now stained like the town. Both fates - the town's and the couple's - are intricately entwined. Returning alone ten years after the town's accident to the inn they first stayed in, and the beginning of his wife's own descent, the narrator reflects on the crumbling of the past, seeing stains and shadows in the room and how his way of thinking, and what he said, came to infect his wife. The rich symbolism of the closing passages have a deep, ironic weight. This is horror of raw feelings, the writing delicately balanced, and being a tale of non-explicit horror it would not have looked out of place in this year's `The Best American Short Stories'...""Hair"" by JOAN AIKEN comes from her posthumously published collection. Brief, but sharp, it tells of Tom keeping a promise to his recently deceased young wife to deliver a lock of her hair to her mother, whom he has never actually met before, his wife having been estranged from her for some time. An old woman, and very strange, Tom soon wishes he had still never met her...Echoes of Ramsey Campbell's influence can also be heard in the tight, dread-filled language of STEVE RASNIC TEM's ""Miri"", which marks his 16th appearance in Best New Horror. Here Rick finds his new life invaded by memories of a damaged and needy girl from his college days. Memories so tangible as to blur and make indistinct the reality he's currently trying to live in...""Corbeaux Bay"" by GEETA ROOPNARINE is a short but effective story of a man who likes to get away from it all by exploring his local beach, where birds to whom he was cruel and dismissive in the past, now take a keen interest in him...""Sad, Dark Thing"" by MICHAEL MARSHALL SMITH is from what was easily last year's best original horror anthology, ` A Book of Horrors' edited by Stephen Jones, which I've reviewed and where readers can find my thoughts on this story. As I said of a Smith story in a review of another Jones anthology from last year, `Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', everything Smith touches at short story length these days turns to gold.  As for this present story, suffice it to say here that it was also reprinted in `The Best British Short Stories 2012', a non-genre literary anthology...ROBERT SILVERBERG is easily the longest serving writer here: his first short story sale was in 1954 when he was eighteen-years-old - almost 60 years ago. Silverberg is a solid novelist, but a dazzling short story writer, as witness the recent massive retrospective from Subterranean Press, `Phases of the Moon: Stories from Six Decades' (2004), and as too witness this present story, ""Smithers and the Ghosts of the Thar"", published in what is now the author's seventh decade as a professional writer. Although Silverberg is indelibly associated with the science fiction genre, Jones has had occasion over the years to reprint his short stories in some of his themed anthologies, but this marks his first appearance in Best New Horror - and it's a welcome inclusion...Old masters such as M.R. James and Robert Aickman are talked of with reverence these days. Will REGGIE OLIVER one day be talked of that way? No, he already is. Oliver's contribution, ""Guieta Non Movere"", is actually lifted from his novella ""The Giacometti Crucifixion"" where it served as a story-within-a-story. That's how good Oliver is, when 'half' a story is so rich in language and storytelling that it can stand on its own...""The Crawling Sky"" by JOE R. LANSDALE sees the return of the Reverend Jedidiah Mercer, who first appeared in the author's cult weird wild west novel 'Dead in the West' (1986), and in recent years in a series of short stories, one of which, ""Deadman's Road"", was included in Best New Horror 19. Lansdale has a voice soaked in the dialect of his East Texas home and his dialogue crackles with sun-lazy barbs and quips, his beloved landscape conjured with a few deft strokes of description. Here the Reverend finds himself in a spit of a little town called Wood Tick where, with shunned local Norville, he goes out to a ramshackle homestead to banish a 'haint' that is not of this world - and his doesn't do so with prayer and holy water!..Together with Simon Strantzas, SIMON KURT UNSWORTH has clearly become a firm favourite of editor Stephen Jones, both having appeared four times now in the  past five volumes of Best New Horror. Here he gives us ""The Ocean Grand, North West Coast"" from his linked-collection of haunted dwellings, `Quiet Houses'. Mandeville, Parry and Yeoman form a restoration crew, and the Ocean Grand is their biggest project yet. Built at the turn of the last century and slowly neglected by a procession of changing owners over the decades, it has now lain derelict for 15 years. An ambitious design, a marriage of function and art, the concept of the hotel was to show the industrial design on the ground floor gradually changing into that of nature on the third floor. As the author himself says, ""[it's] about art created to be viewed, being alone, and going slowly claustrophobically mad.""..The multi-award winning EVANGELINE WALTON may have died in 1996, but here Jones presents us with ""They That Have Wings"", a 'lost' story of World War II in the great tradition of `Weird Tales' magazine...""White Roses, Bloody Silk"" by rising star THANA NIVEAU is quite different from her contribution of last, ""The Pier"". This Victorian era tale of terror may start out slight and whimsical - but don't be fooled: a dinner party and a strange guest soon turns thorny. And bloody...""Passing Through Peacehaven"" is RAMSEY CAMPBELL's second story in this year's volume (he is the only author to be twice given the honour of having two short stories reprinted within a given volume of Best New Horror). Next to Silverberg, Campbell is the second longest serving author in this current edition of Best New Horror, his first sale being in 1962 (indeed, he was only sixteen-years-old; even younger than Silverberg!). He is, without doubt, a giant of the horror field and this year marks his 50th anniversary as a writer. Finally, Best New Horror 23 ends with ""Holiday Home"" by DAVID BUCHAN, a piece of crime flash fiction...There are other fine stories, ""Wait"" by CONRAD WILLIAMS, which I reviewed last year under its original publication in 'Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', one of the best ghost anthologies in years. Prolific novelist and short story writer TIM LEBBON give us a ""Trick of the Light"", a sensitively handled tale from the extremely good and recommended 'House of Fear' edited by Jonathan Oliver (Datlow and Guran also picked stories from this anthology). Plus the author of the bestselling 'Let the Right One In' JOHN AJVIDE LINDQVIST's first short story, my review of which can be found under 'A Book of Horrors'. Six of that anthology's stories have now been reprinted, Ellen Datlow gave special citation to a further two stories in the opening paragraph of her Summation in 'The Best Horror of the Year: Volume Four', one other story has recently won an award and yet another story has been nominated for an award - making that 10 stories that have been 'named checked'; a quite remarkable achievement considering the anthology only contains fourteen stories in total...[This review comes from an advance copy bought at the FantasyCon, Brighton book launch on September 29th.]..Also released today is 'The Mammoth Book of Ghost Stories by Women' edited by Marie 0'Regan - well worth checking out!",````````````
"A useful, but flawed book.","The title of this mathematics textbook indicates its intended audience:  ""Management, Life and Social Sciences"".  If this is indeed its goal, then the book suffers from a serious flaw, namely, the authors have forgotten that individuals studying ""Management, Life and Social Sciences"" come from a wide variety of backgrounds -- backgrounds which may or may not have included solid grounding in principles of higher mathematics.  Persons, like myself, who come into graduate level business studies from another discipline, have not had the benefit of the mathematics foundations which, say, an engineering student might have had..As such, the text needed ""more words between the equations""!  More explanation of the examples would have been extraordinarily helpful.  Furthermore, while the book is supposedly keyed to the TI-83 graphing calculator, in order to actually exploit this resource, an additional volume (currently unavailable) is necessary.  This is, in the eyes of this student...extremely unhelpful..A previous reviewer noted the use of relevant word problems -- and I agree that this has been useful.  What would have been more useful, however, would have been more actual instruction.",
"Absolutely wonderful, must read book!","This is an absolutely phenomenal book! The writing is great, and the story is amazing (and based on real people). A young Venetian girl is kidnapped into slavery and ends up in the harem of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Because she is well educated, she becomes a companion to the heir, Mehmed.  A tragic accident ends that path for her, but she ultimately becomes the wife of the next Sultan, with great influence.  This is the absolute barest of summaries, but if you like historical fiction you will love this book!l The cultural mores, the political realities, human frailties, love and more are all there. It will keep you reading long into the night.",
Great for bread recipes.,Love this cookbook.,
Excellent tale!,"Lucy is a spoiled rich girl, daughter to a spoiled rich woman. She is sent back to England from Singapore during world war II and decide to run away to London with a fit who has been sent to the fourth to escape the blitz. Their adventures, the people they meet and the elements of the war they are exposed to are the bulk of the novel.  However the real story is her recognition that her continued path of spoiled rich girl will lead to a meaningless life lived like her dilettante mother .  Great characters and great character development",
Lovely,"Such a wonderful book. I connect to the main character completely and really enjoyed the journey through this time period. More than a love story, a coming of age as well. I think Austen herself would have appreciated this novel. Well done",
great quality,beautiful map,
Do not judge this book by its cover. Its very pretty cover.,"Do you like your male love-interests perfectly robotic?.Do you like unrelatable obnoxiously wealthy protagonists who love to remind you they are in fact, super rich? (So rich they don't even know or care what brand their generic &#34;designer&#34; shoes are?).Do you like books about Stockholm Syndrome?.Do you like pages, upon pages, upon pages of exposition?.Do you like books with unremarkable relationships that just magically 'click' into place when it's clear neither character would or should be even remotely interested?.Then this is the book for you!",
MISSING PAGES,"The book is great. The 17 missing pages near the end are NOT GREAT. I bought this book back in April, so by the time I got to reading all four-hundred-something pages, it was too late to return the book for one that isn't missing pages 402-419.",

It's just a poorly-written term paper,"This book is easy to read, I'll give it that.  But it is very poorly organized.  It's like someone just sat down and started rambling about ERP without really outlining the book.  Sections are repeated throughout the book.  Major point are difficult to extract.  If I had written this, I'm sure I would have gotten a C.  At least that's what I'd give it.  It just needs to be re-organized.",
"Great entrances, then stalled","I like the concepts behind this book and its stance. “The Electric Joy of Service,” for example, hits hard and immediately with a racist engineer building a lawn jockey-inspired bot, an idea only barely offensive to the industry. But these stories didn’t go past the opening seconds for me: a lot of flash, but I was waiting for them to pickup further, and they made motions of doing so, but somehow stood still. Shame, cuz i saw so much going for them.",
The literary equivalent of modern art...,"After slogging through the first 100 pages of this snoozer I was suddenly seized with the thought that the king might actually have no clothes.  Turning to the last few pages I realized I was right!  This book is the literary equivalent of modern art with the ""intelligencia"" standing around, hands clasped behind their backs, murmuring about how the author has so masterfully ""captured the passage of time"", etc.  Joyce pranked us all with Ulysses and now McGregor is playing the same game, banking on the critics' gullibility. Frankly there are better ways to pass your time...",

I feel like it's two pages forward, one page back! This is not a physchological thriller - this is not a thriller in any category. The murders are pushed way back in the background and are only occassionally discussed. The politics are just plain stupid! I give it one star only due to Ava and Carson's relationship.",

terrible,"This may not be Flynn’s worst book but it is surely in the bottom five. It moves at a pace designed to make a snail look quick, and the excitement is comparable to watching paint dry. Worst of all, it is stocked with enough filler to make five crates of bad sausage. Just a terrible book. He tops it off by giving Rapp a desk job and marrying him off to a whiny bitch that slugged him in the face when he came back from a trip suffering from a gunshot wound. Worst of all, our hero whimpered and sniveled and apologized to this bad excuse for a wife. There is no way to sugarcoat how bad this all is.",

Reading them in order is always the best way! ^^",^^
Kill the Creature!,I had the great fortune to met the author in Acapulco and he signed my copy of his book. This is a scholarly tome that requires more than one reading of it. Extremely in depth research into the subject complete with pictures of the culprits involved in creating the biggest fraud on America's taxpayers. The Federal Reserve Bank is a criminal cartel run by a mob of banksters. The Laws of Nature will eventually end it as the previous 3 central banks have done.,
Super heavy awkward oversized book,[[VIDEOID:3635af1c39aee0ba57b371668e2a3566]] Russian classic in Russian. I won’t give a review of the literature work as that is up to the critics. The book itself is super heavy and awkward size. It’s an oversized book making it very difficult to hold. Real wrist work out. My hands hurt after reading it for a few hours and holding it up.,
A Must Read for Anyone Who Waited Tables!!,"The reviews I read for this book mostly praised its intelligence and literary pace while diminishing its attention to sensation. Oh, those reviewers are so repressed and unfeeling! Unlike the NYT, I happen to like a nicely paced seduction, and Danler deftly weaves fantastic erotic tones into her tale of tastes and self-discovery. She doesn't give you a nicely wrapped closed ending, but takes you on a sweaty high of the peak of innocence with some pretty gorgeous prose and well-written scenes. Who knew a health inspection could feel so suspenseful?! I've never done cocaine, but I expect that the aftermath feels a bit like the end of this novel. It's a bit edgy, uncomfortable, and the world looks a little less pretty than it was before. Such is the end of innocence, right? I was sad when it was over and I'd definitely read whatever she writes next.",

Average,"This was told from the eyes of Rain Pryor.  He was a genuis who will go down in the anals of history as the greatest comedian of all time.  This book does not capture his brillance, but offers a different perspective.",
Completely unoriginal,"There was some promise in the blurb of this book, which is why I picked it up to read, but then I realized it was just a rehash and remix of a bunch of other stories. *The Point* tells the story of a young adult who is wasting her amazing potential until a dramatic event gives her a choice of either going through a grueling training she doesn’t want or getting a punishment. But as it turns out our reluctant protagonist turns out to be the great promising future for her people, especially since the vaguely hinted antagonist has the potential power to bring about an apocalypse. That makes our hero the one true future hope. Nevertheless, she must endure antagonism from her jealous classmates as well as incredibly cruel treatment from the teachers she’s supposed to trust. Sound familiar?..Yes, *The Point* is a mix of Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and the Divergent series with an antagonist who is a straight rip-off of Jessica Jones’ Killgrave. The only thing unique here is the setting which is not quite West Point, but a secret alt-version of the Point just for superhumans buried under the real West Point. But it was never adequately explained why this was placed there, why they were training these people to be officers, especially since most of them—apart from their powers—seemed profoundly not to be Army officer material...Then there are the editorial problems. I can only hope that the review copy I read wasn’t the final version because it wasn’t just typos. At one point, several of the characters must have been different genders because, for paragraphs at a time, the wrong pronouns were used. At another point, the author forgot he told us that the character had a pretty good buzz, because then a couple pages later he tells us that she hasn’t yet got a buzz on. Speaking of which, our protagonist is 18 years old and yet she drinks with no problem in a bar outside of West Point, while the author had just had someone telling another character they couldn’t drink because of being underage. So why could our hero drink? No explanation. Those may seem like minor problems, but they are just a couple examples of the many structural and editing issues with this book...But what most put me off of this book was the incredible casual cruelty. What is it with young adult literature these days that they must always combine world-shattering stakes with incredible cruelty to the protagonist and their companions, not by their enemies, but the people who are supposed to be their mentors. Why can’t we tell smaller stories? Not there shouldn’t be important stakes, but what about consequences that are important to just, say, the protagonist. Okay, put their life on the line. But why must every story be about an incredibly evil enemy who must be destroyed to save the universe? It gets boring after a while...Bottom line is that *The Point* is not a book I can recommend.",

Problem with the paper it was printed on,There is a dent right in the middle of every page - really too bad when the pictures are so great.,
... but this book is absolute trash and I'm very disappointed. I had been looking forward to reading it ...,"I haven't felt the urge to write a book review in a long time but this book is absolute trash and I'm very disappointed. I had been looking forward to reading it because of the great reviews and the recommendation by Reese Witherspoon, so when it arrived I dove right in. I came away genuinely wondering whether any of the positive reviews were by people who had read a book before. I hate being so harsh, but this book was so contrived and poorly written. The plot was incredibly predictable, the language and dialogue mind-numbing, and the ending so neatly wrapped up it was infuriating. This is honestly not even a good beach read/escape. It's basically a Lifetime movie in novel form.",

Excellent book 2 of series,"A different case for Murphy and Rossi this time, a dark and disturbing tale but brilliantly written and very addictive, taking on themes of the breaks in our society and turning them into a haunting tale which is also endlessly fascinating...I’m a fan of Murphy and Rossi as a duo – they are a great “crime fiction” pairing, I find one of the strengths of these tales is how Luca gives focus not only to them but to the people they get involved with in each case, we as readers see both sides of the story, even as identities are hidden to allow for some terrific mystery elements...In the case of “The Dying Place” I was not only enthralled and often disturbed by the tale unfolding but it also gave me pause for thought, to consider the heart of Justice and how that can mean different things to different people. At turns terrifying and emotional this really was a wonderfully constructed thriller with hugely appealing characters, both those we know and those we don’t...A very emotional ending with an excellent lead in to book 3, which I can’t wait for, made this one of my top crime reads of last year. Excellent stuff...**Note: This review from author review copy**",

Wonderful New Fantasy Series,"3.5 stars rounding to 4..I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Defy. I went into this book without any idea what it was about, just that it was a new fantasy series, and I’m always looking for new fantasy to read so I downloaded it asap...In Defy we meet Alexa Hollen… or Alex as she’s better known. She’s a member of the king’s army, being forced to disguise herself as a boy in order to keep herself out of the situation that all other women are thrown into. With the help of her twin brother, Alex uses her skills to earn a position on the prince’s guard...But this is where the main story begins. Even with her skills, she, Prince Damian and fellow guard and friend Rylan are abducted and dragged through the jungle to their enemy’s gates. Where Alex soon finds out that things aren’t exactly as she’s been told, and the secret she and her brother were determined to keep, wasn’t exactly as secret as they thought...I’ll be straight up with you all… love triangle alert. But I think that is fairly evident based on the summary. I’ll also be honest with you and tell you that I don’t hate love triangles like I know some of you do. In this case, it’s very evident to me who she is going to be with. But with this love triangle warning also comes an alert that this turned into being less about the situation Alexa finds herself in and more about how sexy the guys she is with are and I think ultimately that kind of frustrated me...The characters – while I didn’t dislike any of them, I didn’t immediately find myself clinging to any of them either. Is Prince Damian swoony – yes… is Rylan sweet and wonderful to Alex… yes… Is Alexa a strong-willed and independent young girl who can overcome anything – she sure is. All these things together didn’t give me any strong feelings towards anyone in particular though. I just didn’t feel that connection with anyone...My overall thoughts were this – The middle part of this book was slow going for me. I was incredibly bored during their trek through the jungle, but once we started to get a bit more action and less ‘OMG who do I pick’ I found myself enjoying the action and the unraveling of secrets. I think ultimately this is what saved this book for me, we ended up on a high note and I truly found myself finally enjoying the story...I think that for me, this was less fantasy and more YA romance with fantasy elements and I found myself hooked just enough there at the end to know that I will definitely be picking up book 2 in this series to see what Larson does and where this story goes...If you’re looking for a quick read that is hopefully just the start to a wonderful new fantasy series, definitely check this one out!..Thank you to netgalley & Scholastic for the advance copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.",

All I can say is, when is the sequel coming out?.The Wolf is a story of gangs vs terrorists. I wish that part were true. We could use the help.

By the way,.The Wolf is a great audio book too. Well read. Excellent for a long car trip.",

Nice quick read. Gets you thinking,I like the small size. it makes for a quick read and for a small book it packs enough info in it to start up some great conversations. The His-Hers flip book style is genius. Are you new to how things are to work in a relationship? This will set you on the right path with simple discussions on easy topics...I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program..Would I spend my own money on this? No,
Could Not Put this Audio Down!,"Audio Book Review - This was my second Megan Miranda book and I can not wait for the thriller/mystery she releases. The same narrator, Rebekkah Ross, who narrated All The Missing Girls performed The Perfect Stranger. She is easily one of my favorites. I really enjoyed Leah, who is the narrator of the story. And I loved how as the details unfolded, I liked her even more. The whole cast of characters, from supporting, secondary characters to just random extras, they are mattered to the story. They all played a role. What I love about Miranda's writing style, is that it's very simple. It's all easy to follow. It's simple, &#34;I said&#34; and, &#34;He said&#34; and, &#34;she asked&#34;. But this works so well because the story is so deep, you find yourself understanding so much better. I just really loved the way this story was written. I voluntarily reviewed a copy of this book.",
Leaves a lot to be desired,"Lots of cute ideas in the book, but the instructions left much to be desired. The illustration seemed to leave out some of the steps, or have hands covering things I needed to see. Some directions are vague (&#34;form a rose around the band&#34; What?? How??)  The pictures of the compled styles were really nice, but often you are not able to tell exactly how it looks. Overall we had fun, but I would get a different book.",
OK,OK at best.,
Skip it...,"I listened to the audio book and the narrator Kyle McCarley did a fantastic job. He is the only reason why I finished the book. Because if I had read this it would've been DNF less than 50 pages in...This book is the a reminder for me to be careful what I wish for. The last couple of books I read were sorely lacking in world building, this book took it too far. I could see everything because the details were written that intricately. To the point of boredom. Rooms, clothes, jewelry. Names of titles of nobles, religious leaders, and ceremonies were invented. Which is great, but there were so many it was hard to keep track. Standard names like Lord and Priest would've worked too for lesser characters. I also found it weird that all these intricate names and ceremonies were created, but the animals were standard. And although there was mention of magic there wasn't any in this book...Maia, our hero was boring. The standard orphan forced out of seclusion. The problem is there was nothing outstanding about him. He was nice, but no saint. He was smart, but no genius. He wasn't ugly by Elf society standards, but he was no great beauty either. There was nothing about him that stood out. Nothing to make the reader root for him to ""win"". He was a competent ruler, but no champion of the people. If they had killed him off and replaced him at any point in the book I honestly wouldn't have cared...That is another problem with this story. For one that focused on political intrigue and court politics it was lacking both. Starting with our main character. His banishment being accepted by everyone made no sense. His mother a goblin was married to his father to foster an alliance. So her being banished with her baby right after giving birth for the crime of not being an Elf was beyond stupid. Her father the Goblin Emperor should've had more of a reaction. Then she dies and her son, a Prince is sent off to west bubble fuq. Again the Goblin Emperor does nothing. A man with no male heir. He didn't even send a tutor. Maia the fourth son of the Elf Kingdom and the only Prince of the Goblin Kingdom wasn't educated in anything by anyone. He was sent of to rot, when he should've been a pawn his entire life. There were almost no plots at court, no maneuvering.  Just snobs being jerks...It takes forever for there to be any real conflict and even longer for us to find out what happened to his father and brothers. And both things are resolved with relative ease. How does something finally exciting happen, yet it almost instantly becomes boring too. I really don't understand how this book got nominated for so many awards. It must've been a slow year. I won't say I won't ever read this author again, but I won't be reading any more books in this series.",

AWESOME!!!,Super motivating in a way you can’t imagine unless you read. Highly recommend it to literally anyone. It WILL motivate you to dig deeper inside yourself to get more.,
Excellent Book,"Excellent book, and very engaging for the reader. This is one of the best books written about men at war, by the men that were there. This book should be on every bookshelf. As one reviewer said, "" Don't think about it. Buy it."" I concur, don't think, buy.",
It’s ok,If your kids is advanced I’d rather you to choose another grade otherwise it’s ok,
Great!,Great beginner book!,

"Breathtaking in Concept, Scope and Execution","""Our Nation's Archive: The History of the United States in Documents"" is a phenomenal one-of-a-kind historical compendium that will thrill not only the historian and student, but also any citizen mildly interested in our country's evolution...At around 900 pages, it may seem daunting or just another dusty tome of boring text. Instead, it is fascinating and riveting, providing EVERY important direct source document associated with the U.S., from its birth to its continuation into the modern age...Brilliantly, editors Bruun and Crosby have also managed to include ""documents"" almost never included in history books -- speeches, articles and even poetry -- related to the primary documents of the events of the particular period...For example, official documents pertaining to the Great Depression are reprinted, along with a section from John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath,"" a novel of people who lived and suffered through those Dust Bowl days. Likewise, not only is the Executive Order interning Japanese Americans during World War II included, so is a side-bar describing the impact on Japanese American families who lost all of their property...In an age when everything in society seems to revolve around the latest technological advancement, it is very centering to go through this book and read the true historical achievements of these incredible United States. Vividly illustrating its tragedies, as well as the justice and injustice done in the name of this nation, this book is truly like no other...From the Declaration of Independence and the courts, to the true voices of vaunted politicians in their own words as well as the views of everyday citizens, events come to life in as astonishing a publishing accomplishment to come along in decades...With a ""couldn't-be-cheaper"" price, this edition deserves to be in every home, library and school room in America. Even if you thought you knew the history of the United States from sea to shining sea, there is plenty inside these pages to surprise, delight or even sadden and sicken the most careful scholar...Looked at in its entirety, this single volume not only educates, but in this new millennium, provides a sobering atmosphere to ponder the future of the country and every person's role as a responsible citizen. Bravo!!",
Great Follow-Up,This book was a great follow up to the first and I loved it from beginning to end. I can't wait to read more from this author. You are missing out if you don't read this book.,
Great premise,"I enjoyed Heart-Shaped Box more mainly due to its focused narrative.  I found too many flashbacks that bored me. I realize fleshing out characters is needed, but the flashbacks seem overlong.  Halfway through it finally gave me edge-of-seat reading..I enjoy his comics a lot.  Those I recommend.",
Very well written! Compliments to Dave Canterbury,Good job Dave! Thank you for writing books to share your knowledge on the various topics you have knowledge in. The single thing I would recommend is water resistant paper for those who wish to take the books into the bush,
"I purchased this blindly, without even reading the reviews ...","I purchased this blindly, without even reading the reviews...It had a different element that is not usually found in these types of books.  I did not expect that it would take place in France, although the name of the author should have tipped me off.",
Darling gift for all ages!,Darling book - I gave these as high school graduation gifts! The messages are applicable to all and with a fun delivery by Pete the Cat.  It is great for all ages!,
Not what I thought,"I read reviews before ordering. It didn't cost me much, but it won't add anything to my knowledge base. I was looking for different ways to ask assessment questions and this is not helpful after all.",
Okay for the type of book.,It was overdone in some parts and repetitious in the main characters thinking.,
Delightful,Such a great set of books. The complete collection and just what is needed for anyone who likes a good classic story:),
"Very disappointed on so many levels, not like any book I've ever purchased! Horrible!","Where do I start with this book? It deserves no stars. It's not 25 chapters long. Each recipe is labeled a chapter. So there are 25 recipes & pages do not have page numbers, though the table of contents list pages. Unbelievable errors! Look at the photo, one recipe is double spaced and stretched out over multiple pages. I don't know why this is titled ""The lost Superfoods Book for Beginners / Survival Food Guide & Cookbook for Year Supply and Storage""  There is no info about food storing for a year, no superfoods, so far I don't see any recipes meant to be created out of long term storage foods. Their is no instruction about prepping or survival other than to list the 25 recipes double spaced. Many regular recipes with regular food from fridge, freezer, etc. The gravy and biscuits recipe calls for refrigerator canned biscuits?  You know the kind that you score and they make the loud popping noise. Seriously!! Chili, pasta, yogurt and fruit cups using store made yogurt?? Pasta & meatballs, mac & cheese, for example all use butter, frozen or fresh meat and normal ingredients. Jimmy Dean sausage was listed in one of the ingredient lists. LOL Their are a couple of recipes called Pemmican and Hard Tack that are true long term foods, a jerky recipe but other than that, this is a very poor regular cookbook of worthless recipes that any newbie can find online to learn how to cook basic foods, this is not for long term survival food recipes. This is poor quality. The price of this book is completely over priced. I'm in shock!!!  I have never had this issue buying on Amazon. This should be taken off the market for false advertising. I've never ever had to leave this type of review. Seriously - Don't buy - this is clickbait false advertising, buyer beware!",
Good story but a bit predictable,The story overall is good. Probably 3.5 stars but I gave it 4. The execution is a little clunky and predictable. But I finished it in 3 days (quick for me) so I can’t say it didn’t keep me entertained.,
Five Stars,"Delightful book, especially for people interested in frontier life.  It is also amazing how vivid the imagery is just from reading the letters and a few random drawings.  Her words describe people and situations as well or better even than a movie, and you realize you don't really need to see an actual picture to get a complete account what is happening.",

"This is a great novel, but it is really poorly translated by ...","This is a great novel, but it is really poorly translated by Anita Nair. Knowing she's an editor and writer herself, I thought Ms. Nair would bring a great ear to the language of the book, but this is where she fails terribly. The language of the book in its original Malayalam is spare and direct, but Nair uses a lot of trivializing British and American idioms that spoil the rhythm and poetry of the novel, even to the point of distorting the meaning. At one point she uses the word &#34;kerfuffle&#34; to describe a fishermen's brawl. In another part of the book, she says something like &#34;He gave her a tight slap,&#34; when the original translates more like &#34;He gave her a nice hit across the face.&#34; There's no GREAT translation of Chemmeen yet, but Narayana Menon's translation (the first one) and the translation by the author, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, are both better than this one.",
"Good book, no photos","This little book is exactly as expected, little book with great scones recipes! I gave a four star because it would have been nicer with photos but I am enjoying the recipes. Very easy to approach and final product has been husband and toddler approved.",
"Great biography of ""Mr. Cub""","Ron Rapoport has done an outstanding job of chronicling the life and career of ""Mr. Cub,"" Ernie Banks. This book has the perfect blend of personal and baseball-related stories and shows the reader what a great player--and person--Ernie Banks was. I highly recommend this book for any baseball fan. Even if you don't care for the Chicago Cubs, you'll still enjoy this book.",
Good information,Good reference for planning trip.,
Simply Adorable,This book is simply adorable! There is nothing more precious than a dog sticking its face under water!,
This is worth reading if your are interested in Kentucky History,"Other than the Frontiersmen, this is the only book on Simon Kenton I could find that is aimed at adults.  Obviously written by a relative and somewhat biased and exaggerated, still good due to the pre-PC date of publishing.  The indians don't get cut a lot of slack and they don't deserve it.",
Not a fan,Was not a fan. Some of the exercises were very juvenile.,
One of my favorite books of all time,"Such delight. We get to see different stages of Erik's life since his birth and learn what he has learned and done, and where he lived until he becomes the famous Opera Ghost. The book is divided into multiple parts with different POVs. It's never dull. The rhythm of the story is full of detail and emotion. It never disappoints...Not many books make me cry. This was one of them. How I longed for a book like this for a long time. This one has taken the place that Wuthering Heights occupied for years. And Erik is right there besides Heathcliff. I love a villainous and dark main character..The perfect book for Phantom of the Opera fans.",
Yes there are recipes online but I like to have a book to leaf through,"I am not a cook. But I do eat and have to feed my family.  Yes there are recipes online but I like to have a book to leaf through, one with pictures to show how delicious the prepared dish looks. These seem to be tried and true recipes submitted by ordinary people who can cook. I've had the book a week now and have made three recipes. Each came out perfectly. They were easy with normal ingredients. No diet recipes here folks, just good comfort food.",
Very thin notepad,"Cute, but overpriced for what you receive",
4.5 – A Fantastic Heartwrenching YA Paranormal Romance,"Summoner by S.D. Grimm surprised me in so many ways and it was pretty fantastic! To be honest, this book was not what I expected it to be, but that turned out to be a really good thing...Grimm’s writing is beautiful, evocative, and had a nice flow that made it easy to read. The premise is intriguing and had me hooked from the very first page. I thought the idea of witching and summoning spirits was quite fascinating and I wanted to know more about it. The plot is fast-paced and full of action. The mystery, suspense, and danger had me holding my breath a few times and I absolutely loved it!..The characters are so well written and realistic. I liked Allie from the start and I understood her reasons for doing what she did. Cody is very caring and kind that seeing him so guilt-ridden was distressing. Both Allie and Cody are dealing with their own losses and struggling with grief that my heart completely broke for them. It just seemed so right that they would find comfort in each other. While there was an instant attraction between Allie and Cody, I thought their chemistry felt genuine and real. Watching them help each other heal and develop a playful and sweet relationship was so satisfying. Their bantering and flirting made me smile and swoon so much.... instalove or not, I totally ship Allie and Cody and I rooted for them the entire time...Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love that Summoner is not your typical young adult paranormal romance. There’s definitely the supernatural fantasy aspect, the mysterious hard to resist hot guy, and plenty of adorable flirting. BUT more than that, this book deals with difficult real life issues. Grimm does a terrific job portraying the sadness of losing someone you love and the agony of living with guilt. She shows how healing and learning to forgive yourself are not that easy and will take time. I really wasn’t expecting this to be deeply affecting or heartbreaking, but that’s what makes this story brilliant and so powerful. And yes… I absolutely recommend that everyone pick this up!..I received an advanced reader copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a fair review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.",
"Hardly a substitute for the anime, but still a great read.","&quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; has been dubbed one of the greatest anime series ever, and rightfully so. Its plots are original and action-packed, its dub has been called one of the best ever done, and its characters are some of the most beloved characters in the anime community. So it's no surprise that TOKYOPOP decided to bring the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga to the States. Using TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga is a set of stories told within the universe of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; before the final set of episodes. Sadly, the manga is nothing compared to the anime masterpiece; even so, fans of the series and fans of manga in general owe it to themselves to give this manga a look at least..The anime series follows an episode-like format for the most of its 26-episode run (meaning episodes don't have overlapping storylines), and the manga is no different. The first volume of the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga presents four different stories that deal with the characters of the &quot;Bebop&quot;, following their adventures and misadventures as they try to nab bounties so they can collect the reward money and get food in their stomachs. Almost any &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; fan will praise the anime series as having highly original stories and adventures that define the series. Unfortunately, that same fan will most likely look at the stories in the manga and say they are formulaic. Also, the stories has odd pacing issues in several areas, making the volume feel a little unbalanced. Even so, the stories are quite entertaining and do capture some of the charm of the anime. But anyone hoping the manga will hold over as a substitute for the anime until the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; movie arrives on American shores will be sorely disappointed..Visually, some fans might be put off by the artist's interpretation of the characters. Characters in the manga do resemble their anime counterparts, but sometimes they can look a tad-bit distorted. And seeing Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein in chibi-like forms can be a little awkward, considering this rarely happened in the anime. Still, the visual artwork of the manga isn't anything to be disgusted at, but fans of the anime will wants to approach this with caution..In terms of translation, I can honestly say that TOKYOPOP is getting better. Previous efforts such as &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; and &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; used text that was most likely typed in a machine, resulting in several horrible typos, and TOKYOPOP has always been known to deliver mediocre translations. With &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, the text appears to be drawn and not typed, resulting in fewer typos; I couldn't find any at all in this volume. While the translation might be questionable to some people, it doesn't sound static and flat; I actually consider this one of TOKYOPOP's better efforts. And with TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Format&quot;, the volume is read right-to-left, giving it a more authentic feel. It also makes the artwork clearer to see; since it hasn't been photo-reversed, the artwork isn't blurred, dimmed, or distorted..All in all, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; is a good manga series, but only for the right kind of person. Fans of the anime will want to be careful with this series, and manga readers unfamiliar with the anime should also be wary. Still, the manga is very entertaining and is good enough to hold the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; name. And thanks to TOKYOPOP's better-than-normal translation and their &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga can be enjoyed even further..Until volume 2, &quot;SEE YOU, SPACE COWBOY...&quot;",

Melissa's Eclectic Bookshelf Reviews,"This beautiful baby board book knocks one out of the park.  The lesson to express gratitude for the simple yet wonderfully miraculous things in life from kittens purrs, and sloppy dog kisses to pancakes with syrup and a sky full of stars can not be taught at too young an age and is a lesson that we all can benefit from even as adults...Marijan Ramljak's perfectly warm and cozy illustrations are a perfect match to Amy Parker's beautiful message and never grow boring.  This book is a wonderful tool to instill the habit of thankfulness while at the same time enjoying snuggly, cuddly, beautiful together time with your little one...NOTE: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.",

"&quot;Part beauty mark, part brand, a legacy of tribal values.&quot;","In this poignant and sometimes melancholy account of the passing of an era, Mira Kamdar tells the story of her beloved grandmother Motiba, a woman from the agrarian and pastoral culture of old Gujarat, showing how the changes in Motiba's life and family during the past seventy years are also emblematic of dramatic changes in Indian culture as a whole.  Herself the daughter of Motiba's son Prabhakar (Pete) and Lois Christensen, the Danish-American cowgirl he married while a student in the United States in the 1960's, Kamdar is especially sensitive to nuances of culture, and she brings her Indian family to life within the context of the country's history--her grandparents' marriage, her grandfather's adoption of the values of Mahatma Gandhi, the emigration of the family to Burma to manage their businesses there in the 1930's, the bombing of Rangoon by the Japanese during World War II, the return to Bombay, and eventually, the emigration of several of Motiba's children to the United States..As she describes her own life, the author shifts her focus to that of the American immigrant experience.  The tales of Indian history which infused her life as a child visiting in India eventually give way completely to tales of her life in the United States, as she moves with her parents and siblings throughout the west following her father's job changes.  The significance of the death of Gandhi on her grandmother's life yields its place to the effects of the death of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King on her parents' and her own life.  Her father's desire to have his family &quot;fit in&quot; becomes more important to him than teaching them the language and culture in which he grew up..Rich, warm, humorous, and earnest, Motiba's Tattoos recreates the universal story of an immigrant family's metamorphosis from one whose primary allegiance is to another culture to one in which opportunities to assimilate are recognized and embraced.  In the process of becoming American, uniquely personal values may evolve and be treasured, while retention of the old traditions must become a conscious effort.  What was an integral part of their family life, historically, evolves into pleasant memories and echoes of the old way of life as new generations appear--the final result of the Indian diaspora, which began in the mid-20th century and which continues, unabated, to the present day.

Very nice!,Very nice and easy to use!,
Learn to unlearn everything you know,"This book has a very specific audience and it is perfect. You will find yourself down the rabbit hole exploring creatures that exist in someone's mind.

I absolutely loved the twisted story-line. It makes me think twice about meeting a stranger. This author has a magnificent way of writing stories that keeps you glued from beginning to end.

"Lovely voice and setting, but overly ambitious mythic influences sap character autonomy, and the book collapses. Not recommended","Captured from her father's sacked castle, Arpazia is wed to the warlord Draco and bears his child, Coria. Isolated and maddened, Arpazia abandons her daughter--but as Arpazia ages to cronehood and Coria comes of age, the two are tied together by their competing, opposing roles. Mixing the fairy tale of Snow White with the Greek myth of Persephone and early Christian liturgy, White as Snow is bursting with imagery that sometimes weaves a complex, symbolic tapestry and sometimes tangles upon itself in an excess of influence. White as Snow nails its voice and setting and is often an immersive read, but the confused symbolism and unmotivated characters hold it back from being all that it could be. In all, a disappointment and not recommended. (Terri Windling's introduction, on the other hand, is a joy to read.)..What Lee writes best in White as Snow is the voice and setting, a combination which brings the story to life: detailed, haunting, ancient, and utterly convincing, the book is a step back in time and into another, more magical world. And so from the onset, and for its greater part, White as Snow feels like a successful book. It is certainly compelling and immersive, and only gets better when Lee introduces familiar mythic aspects: Snow White and the jealous Queen, Persephone's relationship with the seasonal cycle and the underworld, and the temptation of the deadly sins and the tree of knowledge. But as the book goes on, the convincing setting and voice are not enough: it begins to fall apart...The glut of symbols and myths is ambitious, but overly so: it's an excess of outside influence which doesn't always mesh together. (An example: is the queen's apple the fruit of the tree of knowledge, or a poison, or the gateway to the underworld? Though similar, these symbols are not all one and the same--and it takes more than 300 pages and two characters to unite them.) To compensate, Arpazia and Coria lack motivation, that they are better able to conform to the influences that dictate the courses of their lives. But an unmotivated protagonist rarely makes for a compelling book, and so when the characters are passive figures in the most important events (in particular, Snow White's death) the book collapses in on itself, a victim of too many symbols and not enough of its own plot or characters. I wanted to enjoy White as Snow, and for the most part the writing style and good intentions won me over. But the more I read, the more my doubts grew--and I came away disappointed. It's a good try, but not a success, and I don't recommend it.",

CT you had me from the beginning in your corner and Ida Sue made me want to have you come fix things at my house. Lol,"This book was phenomenal start to finish with some of the best one LINERS I have ever read and the things Ida Sue comes up with had me rolling and laughing..Titan is our one and only CT who wakes up in Vegas to discover that in a drunken stupor has married a lady who, although was hot, he doesn't want to stay married to. He has other commitments to take care of, and a wayward wife doesn't fit into these commitments..Our darlin female is not happy when she wakes up and realises she is married to Titan AKA Big Daddy and does what most females do when we have messed up, she runs. Fast and far away. But can you ever really run from your problems?.These two are the perfect couple when they work their issues out and the interactions they have together are pure gold and will have you laughing until you become teary eyed. Throw in our Ida Sue and other family members and it makes for one kick butt new edition to the ever increasing awesomeness that is our Jordan Marie..I won't say there wasn't some bumps in the road for the couple's HEA,  but never was there a time that you felt the story was dragging or that you wished it would just hurry up and end. To me the exact opposite was going on. I was so hooked that I read as fast as I could to get to the next interaction with CT and Ida Sue, because they were off the charts funny..THIS author get a better with everything she writes and is so into her supporters that it gives me great privilege to read and review her books..Highly recommend this newest book and can't wait for the next one.",
So far so good but the print is the tiniest ever!!!,I like it so far. I just hope my eyesight can holdout. This paperback has the smallest print known to mankind. Maybe the hardcover is better.,
Skip the Sequel,"I happened across Finney's Time and Again and it was a delight...highly original, vivid in its descriptions of 19th century New York with an engaging plot and characters. This sequel is a messy follow-up that is just too forced. One of its characters states that he dislikes the word ""nostalgia"" but that is what this whole effort communicates. Finney gets tied up in a cloying, irritating homage to simpler times that is meandering and uninteresting. I wish I had not picked it up and had only the memory and experience of the first book. One interesting item of note, I believe Stephen King was influenced by one thing that takes place in From Time to Time...the main character hums and sings a song from his future era which causes his wife concern. That same ploy was used in King's 11/22/63.",

Compelling story of post-deployment re-adjustment,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this book from the publisher...This was my first book from author Drusilla Campbell.  I became easily engaged in the subject matter, the story of a woman's re-adjustment to home life after her deployment in Iraq.  Campbell's writing is engaging, and the book was a quick read.  The one issue I had is that early in the novel, it is somewhat difficult to have much empathy for main character Frankie, who comes off as quite abrasive.  The reader might be more understanding with more insight into Frankie's situation--namely, her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but this doesn't come until much later.  Still, if the reader has patience for Frankie, her story is a compelling, worthwhile read.",
Hugely disappointing,"Why this book is so highly rated is completely beyond me. This is really poorly written, even the separation of chapters makes no sense. The story is bland, the ""characters"" bland, the twists it tries to go for just seem so forced and fake. This reminds me of one of those wildly popular tv series that is really low quality but is on network tv and can appeal to the most possible people.",
Still on my private library,"I thought maybe it had a couple of pictures in it but nope. Just words.Very complete, the information is easy to read and find.",
Five Stars,Great Transaction! Awesome Merchandise!,
Typical Schlichter,"Anyone who has read Schlichter’s columns will immediately recognize the sardonic humor and political perspective represented in People’s Republic.  America has split into Red and Blue countries.  The Blues espouse all the values of the Left (gun control, abortion on demand, climate change, government run business and hardcore law enforcement).  The Reds maintain the traditional American values, it’s Constitution, free markets, personal liberties and free speech.  And you know where Schlichter takes it from there.  With dripping sarcasm, he describes life in the Blue zone pretty much as it is in Venezuela and Cuba by simply extending the existing trends of today’s Left.  His military background lends credibility to his protagonist, Kelly Turnbull (ex-Special Forces) who is hired, from time to time, by the USA to conduct secret missions behind enemy lines.  Turnbull turns out to be a stone-cold killing machine. So, Schlichter combines politics and action-adventure to create some pretty funny and entertaining stuff.  It’s not exactly Shakespeare but it will do as well as a glass of smooth scotch on a rainy day to put that warm glow in your stomach.  Now on to Indian Country.",

Too heavy to enjoy reading,"The few pages are printed on paper near the thickness of enameled cardboard. This makes it difficult to turn pages while holding the (very heavy) book up in your lap.

Die for a lie?,"Why would 11 Christians be willing to let other people kill them because they said Jesus was raised from the dead. Many people will die in their religion, but for something they believe. These people believed they saw Jesus raised from the dead. Other groups believe it's okay to die in war, a so-called Marytyr.  Those are actually people of violence attacking others. These Christians, Apostles were not attacking others, by peacefully sharing what they saw. Die for a lie. I wouldn't. Most wouldn't. 11 of the Disciples did.",

Slow and lost it's way with the modern day storyline.,"If this book had simply been the story of the Duchess of Marlborough ( Gladys Spencer-Churchill), I probably would have loved it. The secondary story line with Annie and her mother, Laurel, just dragged and felt entirely irrelevant to me. Neither of those women were of any interest to me. They were in the way of the really interesting character and story - The Duchess. I found myself just skipping pages because I wasn't invested in the book and actually choosing to read other things first. The writing here isn't bad, it just wasn't a tale I could get lost in.",
Capturing,Good ending. Took me 2 weeks to read but I liked it a lot. It's a book I'd definitely recommend if you like crime thrillers.,
Bad translation or what?,"Wow, I can't believe the reviews here. I couldn't make myself read bast the first chapter. I tried to like it. I love the cover and even the idea of the plot, but the writing &#34;style&#34; (if it can be called style) it's horrendous. I just couldn't stand it. I guess if you're used to reading dime novels, you might be able to stomach it. But don't expect too much. Perhaps it's just a bad translation. Maybe it's better in Portuguese.",
What a beautiful book!,This book is so clever how the raised letters fit into cutouts in the opposite page. The colors are bright large and engaging for a young child. My 2 yr old was immediately happy to sit down with me and repeatedly flip back and forth through the pages which she almost never does. She was pointing out all the letters and animals she recognized and I think yak is her new favorite word!,
Wisdom for Aging,A true “gift”  for all of us who are struggling with aging. Parker Palmer’s insight and wisdom prevail.,
A must read for those who care about freedom,This book should be read by everyone. It is a grim reminder of what can happen when government gets out of control. It is an example of the humanity at its worst. The martel  family was one of courage  and determination.  Their faith certainly played an important part in their survival,
Five Stars,Adorable! Bought for 3 year old nephew and he loves it. Great quality and colorful illustrations.,
Son really love it,My son really love truck and cars so I bought this book for him and he absolutely love it. We read this every night and he already memorized all the trucks and cars in the book. I love how simple the illustrations are. Very nice book!,
The First Patient,gripping and exciting and hard to put down.  compelling all the way to the end and can't wait for the next novel,
Great for beginning independent readers.,A very easy to read bio for a school project.,
Strange Maladies for Sure,"Early on in the book I was reminded of Eric Berne's work of forty years ago...which he titled Games People Play in an attempt to describe both functional and dysfunctional social interactions...Berne described the types of social interactions. Now comes Jhumpa Lahiri with her extraordinary talent which allows her to describe how these people communicate with each other and more amazingly, what they say when they communicate with themselves...She is truly an Interpreter of Maladies and as Frederick Busch noted in his oft quoted praise of her Pulitizer.... ""Lahiri honors the vastness and variousness of the world.""..I suspect there are few people who suffer from such maladies but they need an interpreter just like everyone else, I suppose...And Ms. Lahiri is a good one.",
Fantastic read,This book surprised me within a few chapters! The plot is truly amazing and I cannot wait to read the sequel...outstanding author!,
Exploring worlds you never knew existed,This is an absolutely delightful and entertaining book. Great if you like math but intriguing even if math doesn't come easy. Each chapter takes you on a journey exploring worlds you may never knew existed. It is written in an engaging style that keeps you interested even when the math gets a bit overwhelming. Would recommend to anyone with average or above average intelligence and curiosity.,

"Cool science, awesomely conflicted and sympathetic heroine, and a movie-worthy visual adventure.","4.5 stars, actually...MR Carey writes graphic novels/comics in his other writerly incarnation, and the influence of this on this YA future dystopian horror/fantasy is that you are immediately, visually, and viscerally drawn into the story...Although my middle school daughter did not finish the book. So there's that half star the book doesn't get...I was thinking about the difference in our reactions to the beginning of the book (daughter: &#34;what's going on? Who is she? Why do they point a gun at her? Why are the adults so mean?&#34; and me: Ooo, look what Carey is doing here by setting up Melanie as our POV character in the beginning, he can make us entirely sympathetic to Melanie and her girl-crush on her teacher Ms Justineau while at the same time give massive hints to readers familiar with the paranormal fantasy tropes of what exactly the reason is that everyone treats her like garbage and she isn't let out into the outside world) and I think its based on the fact that I am a long-time fantasy/sci fi fan and so pretty much immediately knew what was up with Melanie...My daughter didn't, and so the fact that the book doesn't start answering questions until about halfway through really bothered her...This is mostly a thriller and adventure-through-ruins-of-society kind of story. While Melanie is the main character, we mostly get her POV in the beginning long enough for us to get attached, and then we get shifting POV as she travels with Ms. Justineau, a scientist, and a few soldiers towards the city of Beacon. By the time the POV shifted, it was fine, I was already hooked to Melanie...Another thing that pleased me about this book was the level of science. There are medical explanations and descriptions of cool med-tech tools used in discovering those explanations for Melanie's condition that totally ring true...But the thing that stood out for me the most is that this book really delves into human relationships vis-a-vis the difference between the terrible creatures outside the gates, Melanie herself, Caldwell the cruel and detached scientist, and Ms. Justineau. What are the emotions that make us human? At what point is it worth saying &#34;humans&#34; deserve to live and win-out over other creatures if those humans are willing to perpetuate atrocities in order to do so?..And what about the fierce, uncomplicated loyalty and love between mother-figure and daughter?..Cool science, awesomely conflicted and sympathetic heroine, and a movie-worthy visual adventure.",
Did not receive the picture version as advertised.,I purchased all of the novels from another seller and ordered this one for the picture - which I didn't get.  Only reason I ordered as extra was for the picture of Aidan Turner - someone will get it for Christmas - maybe they will order the rest of the novels.,
"Short, tight, unforgiving","This is a short story, I liked it and it left me wanting more. That's a success. Without spoiling, this story could take place anywhere in the US and is plausible, believable, and emotional. That's all I should say. I'm looking forward to more by Lucas Mangum.",

Intriguing from jump..and keeps going,"Love characters & story of The Zone, the Red Rocks.  Timely concepts.",
Good start to an interesting series,"Ryan Graudin's &#34;Wolf by Wolf&#34; was pretty much what I expected in an YA with an alternate history where the Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan won WWII. Yael is the lead character as a survivor of the camps and experimentation, she enters the annual Axis Tour which is a motorcycle race to celebrate the victories of the world war...Putting the time in the mid-50s was a great idea and adding in the 'extra powers' will probably be something that younger readers will like (although I admit that I could have done without it). Yael has a mission though and that is to assassinate Hitler and both the race and the mission create tension enough to keep my attention...The pace was surprisingly slow but I still enjoyed the story overall. This is the first book of the series and it was a good start.",
Five Stars,My daughters very favorite book. I've read it a good 100 times now.,

Yoga book,Lovely,
I couldn't finish it,"It wasn't the fault of the book, necessarily; it could be that I was getting into a series in the middle and didn't have the background. The basic plot--the mysterious deaths of people involved in an auto accident--had to be accepted for the book to be enjoyed, and I thought it was far-fetched. Again, I'm not blaming the author; that's why I'm giving it three stars in a sort of share-the-blame idea; I think it would have been better if I had been able to get into the book before the murders started. My only recommendation to anyone reading this book as his first Roy Grace consider reading the books that came before first.",
Satisfying read,"This is a very involved, expertly crafted tale of dependency, love, mystery and celebrity. #darkcircles kept me interested and excited to see what happened next. I felt the ending was satisfactory and found it to have a little twist with the title..I received a copy of this from #netgalley and the publisher, the review is my own.",
Little House By Boston Bay,"Although not written by Ingalls, Little House By Boston Bay continues in the spirit of her books.  This time it centers on Charlotte, the grandmother of Laura Ingalls Wilder.  It is the first book in the series and starts when Charlotte is almost five years old...Most of the book details Charlotte's life and the almost year that it covers.  Most notably, this book takes place during the War of 1812 and so there is quite a bit of information included in there; especially a copy of the Star Spangled Banner and other songs.  Charlotte's days are filled with chores and playing with her new doll whom she has trouble naming.  She also goes to school and meets a new friend named Susan and even tries to go to Scotland (although she doesn't realize how far away it is.)  She listens to her mother's stories and helps with setting the table with her special ""Saturday Family"" (jars, bottles and etc. with condiments for the table)...The characters in this book are mostly well written.  I do think that Charlotte, being 4-5 in this book, sounds a little too old and mature for the age.  But times were different back then so I could be wrong.  Her brothers and sisters are present but not really developed too much; the same goes for her father.  Where the characters really shine though is her mother.  Her mother is a bright personality with a lot of oomph in her and there is quite a bit of detail written about her...Wiley has a nice writing style and it is somewhat similar in style to Wilders.  She adds the same element of almost a diary type of writing as the other Little Houses' do, but doesn't have as much useful information within the pages.  Out of everything that is described, it is not done in a way that makes me think I could repeat it like I could with the original series.  However, there is a recipe for pounded cheese that almost seems doable by reading the description.  This is a great book for kids and reading it at my age is probably why I find more fault with it in this regards.  It is a simple story about a girl and her life...Not my favorite of the whole grouping of books but it wasn't bad either.  The whole series from Laura's stories, to her mothers, and so-on are a charming group of books.  They are perfect for cozying up by a fire and reading with your children, or even by yourself for reminiscing...Little House By Boston Bay.Copyright 1999.195 pages..Review by M. Reynard 2010",
A Good Read But a Few Quibbles,"The first 3/4 of the audiobook are amazing.  Creative.  Well-written, fast paced and funny.  Then it devolves into Starship Troopers which carries on to book 2 of the series.  I enjoyed it but will stop with book 2.  A huge complaint and probably not the author's fault.  Every quote ends with ""he said"" or ""she said.""  Even in a two person conversation where it is painfully obvious who is speaking.  Maybe ok in written form but in an audiobook becomes like nails on the chalkboard.  It's the equivalent to talking to a person who says ""you know"" after ever other word.  That said, I enjoyed the book and the narrator is excellent.",
Fantastic!,Just what I had hoped it to be...The book is well written and gives excellent instructions! I feel that I got more then I paid for with this purchase!,

Five Stars,Excellent source book for writers.,
Great Suspense and Characters!,I love the suspense and mystery!!  Awesome book!  I am ready them all!!,
Good start to a promising conclusion,"3.5 stars … this is a fairly new author to me; I like her dark and depraved imagination and the blurb definitely hooked me in. I read yellow thorns which is actually the first 3 chapters of this book rather than a teaser to whet your appetite of what was to come so I did feel a little cheated here...Continuing on… the story had great potential. Plenty of crumbs dropped at secrets and current events in the plot that I thoroughly enjoyed. It’s a typical NA bully type romance; one girl on the out and bullied by the mean girls. My heart instantly went out to Naomi but the character was strong and was able to hold her own which I enjoyed. Giving the proverbial middle finger to anyone that tries to belittle her...Along comes the star quarterback, the hot guy everyone wants. Whilst he had my attention; once he set his sights on Naomi it’s like a switch flipped on his personality so I felt it was missing development here. Then for the next 50% of the book it’s about the chase / the protests and what happens when he catches her. This I thought went on for far too long. It was unnecessary filler. Great dark, depraved raw sex but way too much. It brought nothing further to the story IMO and the plot didn’t really develop and was spent solely on these two characters. Once we got past this it was back to the plot that I was invested in...The last 20% had me hooked and kept me invested enough to want to know the answers and what’s in store for these characters. Without reading part 2; I think this could easily have been made a decent length standalone story.",
"If you must pick one, choose this one!","Out of the two Nina Guerrera series books I’ve read so far, this one was by far the show stopper. The first book was phenomenal and set the scene for the second novel beautifully. I tore through this one in a day, absolutely astonishing!",

"""A Red Menace in Beautiful Venice!""","I found this book on an Amazon Kindle special, and I was pleasantly surprised!  ""Red Blitz"" is the first work by James Raven I have read, and I know I shall try another.  The terrorism theme in the book is sadly becoming more and more plausible in today's world; I think if I had read this 20 years or so ago, its ""realism"" would not have been as great as it is today.  In the first few chapters, we discover that dozens of bombs have been hidden throughout Venice by a terrorist who is found dead.  But, as time quickly passes, things are not quite what they appear to be...The story line was good; it was not the most challenging story I've read, but it was enjoyable and kept your interest. It is more of a novella than a fully developed novel - about 150 pages, but once you get reading, the pages turn faster and faster and suddenly you are done. Still, the plot was original, and the pace certainly drove the action along. The setting of Venice is beautiful and inspired. The characterization was good, and there were some well-rounded, nicely thought out characters. The shortness of the story limited some character development which would have strengthened the book. I especially liked the central character of  Armond Cali who is the current leader of Venice paramilitary police force, known as the Carabinieri. His character did actually seem like one who could evolve in another story.  I did struggle over three or four stars due mainly to the ""shortness"" of the story; I felt that more develop in story line and character would have helped.  However, due to the gripping, innovative nature of the plot which did create a ""page turner,"" I gave it four stars.  ""Red Blitz"" is a tense ""thriller"" which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre.",
A Long Read: Spoiler Alert! Something Very Important That Might Ruin Your Read,"Okay, people who read my reviews on Amazon know what's coming. I hate &#34;true stories&#34; or historical pieces that are not TRUE...I was enjoying this book very much though at times it gets a little 'made up' sounding. Almost like the writer is sort of winging it. So, about 3/4ths through, I start doing some research only to discover the whole thing is a fabrication. It's a lie. Well, so what if it's a good story? That can be up to you. For me, it confirmed what I was sensing in the writing. This guy just wasn't there. It's all made up...From then on, it was very hard to read on knowing it was all a fake.  Then I hit the chapter on their encounter with the abominable snow man. (Snow People? 8' tall!)  Okay, that was just over the top nonsense...It is a fun listen if you don't care or don't know it's a complete fake. Except for some of the totally outlandish nonsense...I am being generous with the stars. The story is pretty good. It's a decent hoax. But it isn't a super-human feat of survival.",
Eh,Got this because it was required by professor. So many mistakes and the book seems to be written by someone not in the medical profession. A lot of made up words.,
NOT YOUR TYPICAL EXPAT STORY,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked the way the author Justine Vander Leun has the ability to beautifully detail her experiences in a foreign land through her keen perceptions and skillful writing. But at times, I felt that the writing was dull and uneventful. This is definitely not your typical expat book that Frances Mayes and Peter Mayle have made so popular. The author writes about her love for a dog that she meets and ends up naming it Marcus before she realizes that he is actually a she! That part is very heartwarming but at times sad. She chronicles her new life with her Italian boyfriend Emanuele and his family noting some major differences between her previous life in New York City and Collelungo, a rural Umbrian town of just 200 inhabitants. I finished the book, but I can't say that I couldn't wait to get to the next page. I would have liked to see the tempo of this book picked up a bit.",
Like Indiana Jones 4 or the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy some things just are necessary.,"Decent story. But like all sequels, especially to any groundbreaking story, this has a hard time living up to the first. Miller manages to create a good enough plot for the book, but the layout of the panels is all over the place. The art is a little bit off and the coloring by Varley is usually breathtaking, but not in this case. there are certain pages where you cannot tell for the life of you what exactly is going on. Frank Miller is by no means a bad artist, this book just needed alot more careful planning and better structure. If he is going to do a DK3 there's going to be much more painstaking attention to detail this time...I'd give it a 5.5/10 for a slightly compelling story that is worth reading (IMO) but not worth the fuss of The Dark Knight Returns.",
Very little information about the title character,"This book provides very little information about the title character, and nothing much at all until the last chapter.  Instead, it is a poorly-written, repetitive and jumpy history of the Chinese in America.  The author repeats himself frequently, puts quotes around phrases which do not require it, and recounts anecdotes in a way that makes them boring and irritating.  I felt I was fighting with this book all the way.  The title subject was illiterate and lived a very isolated existence, so there are nothing more than secod-hand accounts and speculation about her.  Even her real name is not known.",
Dominic,"Emotionally gripping this story delves into every womans unspeakable nightmare of being kidnapped and worse if possible. And yet in its darkest recesses we are given hope, possibilities of light to come shinning through to give us a glimpse that humanity still hangs on by a thread. That life is still worth fighting for...We are plunged into the darkest recess of human nature. A man who knows only cruelty, murder and yet some thread of goodness still remains. Love is a powerful tool that can and does change a person. This is a story the reader will remember for a long time after the last page has been closed. The characters remain to linger in your soul and their story one that wont easily be forgotten.",
Forgot how much I loved her books!,Just amazing twists and turns. Takes place in Scotland and Italy. Centered around the miners troubles in Scotland in 1984. She has such a way of pulling you into the story and the fascinating descriptions of the politics of relationships. Not typical boring murders either which makes it even better!,
Nice,Love it,
Heart-wrenching,"I just finished reading this book on Kindle.  I must say that after reading the first few pages, I had to put it down and deal with some strong emotions that I began to experience.  It brought back some unpleasant memories of my own.  Although I didn't experience or even imagine abuse to this degree, I can sympathize and grieve with her.  It is very touching and so tragic.  It really makes me so upset and angry with any person who could treat another living thing with such cruelty and anger and hatred.  All types of abuse are forever hurtful!  Thank you for sharing your experiences so that it can be brought out into the light, and we can all learn something from it, and take action when we must!..Reading the book, I am happy that Sarah is doing well, is a loving and caring person, and has loving and caring family surrounding her!  Healing from this and other abuse can possibly never be complete.  It's difficult to forgive and forget...but when we do, it sets us free.  To try to understand how or why someone could treat another person, let alone their own child, in such a horrible way...it's almost impossible.  I have spent many years trying to understand.  I think it's even worse when the abuser denies that it ever happened.  I only now realized there is a first book.  I'm glad to know that this sad and frightening tale has a happy ending.  Yay for you, Sarah!!  Blessings to you and your family!  Much Love!",
Excellent series. Well written.,"The entire Dresden Files series are very well written. They are exciting, humorous in the narrators self deprecating way, and very inventive.

“Every ugly toad thinks that sooner or later he is going to get to eat the meat of a swan.”,"Mai Jia, a popular novelist and winner of the Mao Dun Literature Prize, China’s highest literary honor, writes here under a pen name after serving for seventeen years as a member of the People’s Liberation Army and its intelligence services. Decoded, originally written and published for a Chinese audience in 2002, and newly translated and published in English, provides a fascinating study of cryptography and its dedicated cryptographers, many of whom give their lives (and even their sanity) to their work.  The exciting and revelatory translation by Olivia Milburn and Christopher Payne provides new insights into worlds that have been closed to most of us, not just the hidden world of cryptography and the psychological toll it takes on those who dedicate their lives to it, but also the world of the People’s Republic of China and the thinking of many of its people...Astonishing in its focus on the travails and inner torments of one major character, Rong Jinzhen, the novel features a psychological, individualized approach, something I did not expect for characters living within the group culture of China, especially among characters from the army and its secret intelligence services. An orphan who grows up within two adoptive homes, Rong Jinzhen, known in childhood as “Duckling,” is a mathematical genius, called “Idiot Savvy” in school, but he never stops feeling isolated and apart, however praised he might be for his brilliance and dedication to intellectual goals.  He counts ants, the days that his “Daddy” has lived on earth before his death at age eighty-eight, invents his own multiplication tables, and becomes a chess player at the highest level of competition...The older and more dedicated he becomes to what he is learning, however, the more preoccupied – even autistic – he becomes.  With his lively mind focused totally on intellectual goals, he evokes our concern as he fails to make friends or find any happiness or inner peace. When he is eventually selected to work as a cryptographer for the state, he must leave behind everything he has ever known to participate at a remote and secret location on a project which will eventually consume him – the deciphering of PURPLE, the most difficult cipher ever created.  Once Rong Jinzhen (often called Zhendi by those who remember him) disappears into Unit 701, he is essentially lost to everyone else who has known him as he works to break this code for his country...The remainder of the novel appears in the form of interviews with two people, Master Rong, a female member of his family whom he saved during the Cultural Revolution, and Director Zheng, the man who persuaded him to join the cryptography unit.  These interviews convey Jinzhen’s history and his story, but they feature much “telling about” the action, instead of creating lively stories told from “inside the moment.” The author’s use of dreams, often disorderly, reveal Jinzhen’s state of mind, and a shift in style from narrative to Jinzhen’s internal reveries to convey his inner turmoil in the middle section of the novel show his alarming changes. A literary novel, unique in its focus, setting, and subject matter, Decoded lives up to its title, providing exciting new insights into many aspects of life in the People’s Republic of China - and if a reader also happens to be a mathematician or serious games player¬, this novel will be utterly irresistible.",¬

They take me back to a time where everyone knew everyone in your neighborhood, kids could play outside and not be hurt, and the little shopping area in your town...""Twenty Wishes"" is the 4th installment of the series and she is doing great keeping up with all the characters.  Usually in series books they don't keep up with other characters when they try to concentrate on one...The list idea reminds me of ""The Bucket List""-and it has inspired me to create my own...I highly recommend this book-especially if you want to find out what is going on in Lillie and Barbie's lives at the moment.  A good and quick read.",
A labor of love about a totally irrelevant subject,"The writer clearly knows what he is talking about, and he is a respected auto racing journalist...However, this book is boring as hell sometimes. It is overling and tedious...I simply don't care about men in suits going around battling  about stock market, power games, etc etc. Yes, it was (and is important) duue to jobs involved. But, ti race fans, I don't care at all...The end result of this mess was a spec series without any fun, with some teams so powerful that they can put FOUR cars on the grid every race. And one of the team owners even BOUGHT Indianapolis Speedway!!!..The business men, as almost always, destroyed the sport due to sheer greed disguised as ""we want the best for everyone"".",
Great author,This book series is absolutely wonderful for children to read it keeps them interested in reading and they love them,
Pretty pictures,Like that the pictures are so nice and easy to use.  Wish they had a few more pictures but it was great and it had explanations for those who are newer to art,
a great read,"This book was something extraordinary. Linguistically it blends proper English, English slang, spiced up with a Domincana vernacular while telling a family saga that opens ones' mind and heart to contemporary immigrant struggle in the USA.",

Not wild about ending.,Same problem as most books of this type.  The ending was contrived. I imagine the author thought he was clever.  I do not agree.  Endings should tie everything together and if they don't it makes your judgment of the book less positive.,

What a WONDERFUL book!,"This is what you need. This book, a personal book, filled with simple truths tested since time immemorial.

We all, in these times think, can we just get an honest, forthright leader. Can we please. Governor Noem is that kind of person. And it's intensely refreshing. The book made me happy and its helps in these times of turmoil to reset, smile, and be hopeful.",
Incredibly historically accurate yet fun reading,What a great way to tell one woman's story and educate us on the early founding fathers at the same time.  I never expected to be so well informed and  yet entertained.  Incredible researching and retelling.  Bravo!,
Five Stars,Super cool and extremely interesting,
Love It!,I love this journal! Very well organized and high-quality. Pretty design as well.,

The best book,My daughter's favorite Christmas gift!,
Beautiful coloring book,Love it!,
Alrighty then,"Book was great, loved 1 and 2 as well as this one but I had enought with Black Please read 1 and 2 before reading this one.",
Apologies to all McMurty fans,"I did not like this book, did not. McMurtry is one of my favorite writers but if I had read this first, I don't know if I would have read any other of his books. McMurtry is still an phenomenal writer but the book did not move me as much as some of his other books. This was required for an english class and I really had to work to read it and relate to it. Just because I didn't like this book very much doesn't mean that all of McMurtry other books are the same. I absolutely loved Lonesome Dove and the Berrybender saga and on and on.",
A good book for every day life,[[VIDEOID:mo2VOREGW0LRZD6]]Review of Soul Tattoo and who it is for,
Very good crime story author.,"Excellent story-line.  I thoroughly enjoy reading Karin Slaughter's books.  She expertly combines the aspect of the crime,  the work of the police and the coroner's office, all the while teasing you with the ups and downs of the character's love lives.  I also appreciate they way she involves the lives of numerous characters.",
Not the best Grisham,"John Grisham has written a number of very good legal thrillers. The Appeal is not one of them. I have three reasons for my low rating..1. It is too black and white. All the bad guys are uniformly bad and the good guys uniformly good. The main plot involves a chemical company dumping toxic wastes that contaminate the water supply of a small Mississippi town resulting in numerous deaths from cancer. Finally, after her husband and son die from cancer a woman sues the company. A husband and wife team prosecute the case and the jury awards the woman $41 million. Of course the company appeals and a group of sleazy political operatives arrange for a young lawyer to run for the Mississippi Supreme Court with the intention of overturning the verdict...2. It Is hard to tell fact from fiction. In the Author's Note Grisham admits that much of the novel is made up. At the same time some of it is factual. It is hard to tell the difference. For example Grisham cites statistics the show Mississippians to be gun-loving, religiously conservative bigots and the appellate justice system to be corruptible...3. The ending is unsatisfying and incomplete. The reader is left with a feeling of injustice being done. For fans of Grisham there are many of his other novels that are worth reading,",$
Good read,"Very well written with well developed characters. I haven't read any of the other stories referred to in Nameless' chronicles but will have to remedy that. I like having all the stories in one volume so I can go from one to the other. Laugh out loud funny in places. In my doctor's waiting room I burst out into giggles and had a bunch of people look at me rather strangely, but they weren't seeing in their minds eye two of the characters hiding in a pile of pig poo. I love having the book on my Kindle Fire because I can touch a word to get the meaning, very helpful with the British slang terms used. Recommend if you want to be entertained but know there is also a deeper story under the funny fluff. Ca Bookworm",
Quick & easy read with a story that draws you in.,One of the best books I've read in awhile.,
Not impressed with the characters,"I know that Ed Brubaker has a strong reputation in the comics community, but I can't say that I was impressed with this. Kill or be killed establishes itself as a more grounded take on the vigilante genre of comics, but over four issues, I'm not really looking forward to more...The story starts on our main character killing a bunch of gang members, and him flashing back to how he got to this point. Dylan is a professional student with a lot (and I mean a lot) of mental health problems. After attempting to take his own life, he sees a demon (or does he!?) who tells him that unless he takes a life of someone who deserves it every month, he'll die instead. The story then follows his first sloppy kills to when I suppose he eventually gets good...I suppose my basic problem with the series is that it both wants to act as political commentary while also being bleak for the sake of being bleak. Dylan is prone to making standard political commentary about police violence, the drug trade, and social problems, which is fine as far as it goes. But he also wants to disregard the law and kill people to make the world better, which goes against pretty much everything the first thing is trying to be. This type of having the cake and eating it too results in some of the worst Punisher stories, and it doesn't work any better here. The fact that all the main characters are basically screw-ups didn't endear me to them either...I will say the artwork is good, but I'm not planning on going any further with this series.",
Good Read,Really enjoyed this novel. I do love historical fiction. The story was well developed and kept me guessing as to what would happen. I liked that it was not so fast paced that I couldn't put it down. I could read some of it and then savor in my imagination what life in Scotland in 80 AD.,
Thirty years a slave is a book for everyone,Excellent book about the history of Elizabeth Keckley.  She seems to be the only person that stood by Mrs. Lincoln.,
better than a travel guide,"This was a nice book to read before I left for Sydney. Gave me a bit of a different perspective than a travel guide would, while still offering plenty to explore.",
This is a great book for healing your broken heart,Found this author on Facebook. This is a great book for healing your broken heart.,
OK read,"Wanted closure to the Bookshots &#34;Cross Kill&#34;, but did not get it. Hard to believe the author just let this short story go unresolved. No more pre-orders. I will wait to read the early reviews on the next novel before I spend the cash.",
Super cute !!!,I highly recommended this book !!!,
Most Americans don't know much about the war in the east and the huge role the Russians (as much as I don't like them) played in,"May be the most compelling book I have ever read.  Gripping, leaves one almost exhausted after reading & makes you wonder how anyone survived this ordeal.  Most Americans don't know much about the war in the east and the huge role the Russians (as much as I don't like them) played in defeating the Nazis.  They did it, with the help of our materials to be sure, but they bore the bulk of the fighting and deaths..This book describes an ordeal that is almost impossible to fathom.  And then he returned to nothing!.A truely compelling book!",
Great book!,Excellent - just like all her others!,

The story is excellent at holding my attention and was over much too soon,"Story..The Awakening: Aegis of Merlin Series, Book 2 by James E. Wisher and narrated by Joe Hempel is the second in a trilogy of books. The story picks up at the end of the summer break as Conryu and Maria head to The North American Alliance’s Arcane Academy by a magically powered train. He is once again harried by the press and one reporter in particular. Conryu is a fish out of water at the academy. He does not want to be there any more than most of the student population that views him as an abomination wants him to be there. This could not be made more clear that his initial reception of being bombarded with tomatoes upon arrival by three upper-class wizards...The first book in the series was devoted to world building and giving broad strokes to a wide canvas to give the reader and listener a feel for what kind of scope there was to this magical world. This time out the author has pulled back to focus on the hero’s journey. We get to see the highs and low’s Conryu endures during his first semester at the Academy. He is ostracized, attacked, and even Maria has little time for him. What is the only male wizard to do?..Conryu strives to make the best of it while trying to slowly understand his magical abilities and learn to live in a world foreign to him. He slowly makes friends and joins a Wizards club. As the semester goes on life moves on for both Conryu and Maria. When she is No longer the center of Conryu’s universe leads it leads to Maria’s consternation...Attention Holding..The story is excellent at holding my attention and was over much too soon. There are bound to be some comparisons to Harry Potter due to the Magic Train and a Magic Academy. But that’s about where it will end. These books are for older audiences and Harry Potter never signed a contract with a Demon. The world is unique and thought-provoking and holds the listener's interest due to the great story and the great narration...Narration/Production Quality..The narration is by Joe Hempel. Mr. Hempel again provides an outstanding vocal performance in this second audiobook in this series. He delivers not only compelling narration but also provides a wide range of vocal character’s interpretations. Each character was recognizable with unique voices done in a natural manner. The production quality by Tantor was top of the line as always they never fail to produce a high-quality audio product. Tantor delivered a crystal clear product of the highest listening quality...Audiobook was provided for review by the narrator...Please find this complete review and many others at my review blog...[If this review helped, please press YES. Thanks!]",
Interesting premise,"I am a big fan of the “V” series.  This is a well written story, but it just never quite sucked me into the plot.  In my opinion, it was good but lacked feeling real.",
Very Cute!,"I got this as a graduation present for my boyfriend (cliche, I know...) but it was very cute!  I had everyone in his family sign in the inside (year book style) and it proved to be a very sweet idea.  The book came quickly and in flawless condition!",
Too simplistic,"I hate writing negative reviews because I know how much work went into publishing the work, but... This work is sub-par, and I believe the author could do better. I like the idea of a modern retelling of the original story, which is what I thought this would be, and I even liked the time-travel twist for the most part. Unfortunately, the writing itself was too simplistic for an Austen-inspired story. Better writing, more along the style of Austen herself, would have added to the integrity and credence of the story. However, if you're stuck in a car and looking for meager escapist literature, you may enjoy this book. Just get it from the library.",
Five Stars,GREAT Murder Series!,
GOOD BOOK,Informative and interesting.,
Perfect book for reading to curious baby!,Builds relationships and skills! Good for language development!,
Five Stars,"Beautiful book, great instructions!",
Travel size,This is listed as a coloring book not a travel size coloring book so disappointed...and some of the designs are not even what I'd call steampunk glad I didn't order the set and next time I will read reviews because that's the only place you could find a size listed,
Excellent book on Ike’s career.,Love The Walton’s and this book about the background of Ike was fabulous!!  I could not put it down!!  Read it in a couple of hours.  I highly recommend for any fans and others.,
A very poetic and readable book,What a uniquely written book. The author has a wonderful ability of conveying historic information in a very poetic and readable style. A very enjoyable read.,
"A book about the business of rock 'n roll, not the music","I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is well researched and extensively detailed. On the other, much of this information is hardly bias-free, being shared with the author by Klein's son, Jody, in the hope that Goodman's biography will change the public perception. (That perception, basically, was that Allen Klein was a talented businessman--as a manager of some of the most important musicians of the 1960s and 1970s--but one who bilked major music artists out of fortunes, while still increasing the percent of earnings the artists themselves were earning. Klein was a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a man--and his story is a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a biography.)..Klein is quite a character-- a Jewish boy who spent some of his childhood in an orphanage and much of the rest, passed around experiencing the &#34;school of hard knocks&#34;. He emerged a tough, shrewd guy who learned to be an accountant and wasn't afraid to give unwelcome financial news to clients--even when they were members of the Mafia.  This tough-talking street savvy guy seemed perfect as a business manager for musicians and it's mainly on his relationships as the manager for many legends that this book concentrates. Among them are Bobby Darin, Sam Cooke, The Who, Donovan, Dave Clark, and - of course- per the title, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles (the latter, only after they had stopped performing as a group)...If the rock and roll business and its history interests you, you may enjoy Klein's story. For me, there just wasn't enough about the musicians or the music (other than confirming my feeling that I'd like Paul McCartney in person. The other Beatles, urged on by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were on board for Klein as their manager. But McCartney didn't like or trust him--as it turned out, with good reason--and this division was part of what precipitated their breakup, per Goodman)...My review is mixed just as my feelings about Klein are mixed. Again, the good thing is that Klein found so many artists who were in terrible financial contracts and extricated them then made their music more profitable for them than before. On the other hand, he took a lot of these new-found profits for himself and, much worse imo, he took the rights to their songs for himself and in most cases they were unable to get them back. In 1970, the Stones fired him, only to discover that he owned many of their songs and records. He did the same to the Beatles and they learned the same thing. He went to prison in 1979 for tax evasion but only served two months...Writing-wise, this is very detailed--sometimes too much so in describing people Klein interacted with--but he never really &#34;came alive&#34; to me in the telling. Perhaps it was because the author--so close to the son--is guarded in how negative to make Klein appear but as a result, it seems kind of flat and doesn't really &#34;ring true&#34;. I didn't see any interviews with McCartney (who didn't trust him--and was right) or Jagger (who hated Klein's guts for ripping them off) and their versions of events might have given this book the passion and emotion it otherwise lacked by, in my opinion, trying to gloss over a bit of what Klein really was and what he did.",
Brutally Honest In All The Right Ways,"This book was phenomenal. A potent dose of reality that will likely offend some for its brutal honesty. But that's what a good book does right? It gets you to think and probably sheds some light, providing a perspective you might not have otherwise had. No diplomatic​ niceties, no colorblindness but real talk. Mr. Coates is a National Book Award Winner for good reason. Seamless writing about the absoluteness of being black in America. A job well done.",
Love Nibbles,"All the Nibbles books are great. A monster eats his way thru the book, going into other stories in the process. Hr creates holes in the book which is fun for kids.",
Félix Vallotton,Ordered this for my son.  He loves this art form.  Recommended.,
Good Mystery,"Not quite a story that you can't put down, but one that contains intrigue and a developed plot that made me like to pick it up every day to read until the end.  It's a true mystery in determining who the culprit(s) are and why the murder occurred.  Although I clicked on one-dimensional for the characters, they're a good deal more than that, so other reviewers might easily click on developed and I wouldn't argue.  I live in the area where the author's career in television developed, and am familiar with that, so it was fun to read about places with which I'm familiar.",
Graveyard of Memories,"The book is a wonderful travel guide for anyone planning a trip to Tokyo. Very descriptive. I couldn't put the book down waiting for the next move. I liked the ""hero"" he was authentic.",
Amazing book,Purchased as a gift for my uncle who has always loved astronomy. I was reluctant because I didnt want to get him a 'kids' book. I jumped for it and so happy. It is so much thicker than I thought it would be. And like others say the layout and illustration is beautiful. A great book to refer to. Can't wait for him to open it! Took the cover photo in the sun to see the awesome effect on the hard cover..UPDATE: gift was received very well. Very pleased !,
Scariest thing I've ever read.,"Terrifying book from cover to cover! Very interesting read, keeping me on edge the entire time. I could only read this during the daylight. It's written very well and is very detailed.  It also includes a few pictures of the family and house which is pretty neat.",
Five Stars,Excellent book to learn C#,
Nice little book for Bob Ross fans!,"Purchased multiple copies as a gag gift for my sons and nephews who love watching Bob on Netflix and repeating everything he says.  They love it! It has all his famous quotes which is perfect, along with many of his paintings.  Must have for any Bob Ross fan.",
MID to say the least “SPOILER ALERT”,"I have read my fair share of manga/manhwa and I had high hopes for this one. I thought it was going to be amazing!! NOPE story wasn’t clear from the start, ending had no build up. You could barely understand what the ending even means. No character development. Is the class prez a perv or not, is he married or not. Some scenes just didn’t make sense. Waste of money to be honest.",
Not impressed,"This book was a let down. Arrived in great condition and in good time, but I found this novel just to be a re-hash of 'Bastard Out of Carolina'... Not worth it, skip this one.",
Small Book Little Information,Was disappointed in this book. It is small so does not have much information. Better books are out there on this same subject. Save your money and purchase one of those.,
Like Seeing an Old Friend Again After a Long Separation,"I have really enjoyed this series - now up to number 12 I think with this installment. It is unique in many ways and teaches many lessons about life...When I first heard about the series, it was on book 6. It worked out well, because I had so many books to read without having to wait. Now, I am all caught up, so the year between books seems like a very long time. It is like having to wait before getting to see an old friend again - well, the old friend in this case has come back for a visit!..Besides the more obvious things like the great characters in the series - after a while they seem like you actually know them as you would real people - what I really liked about the series is the detail about Botswana and life there. And so much of it is positive, unlike so much of what you hear about Africa these days. The books also teach many lessons useful to people everywhere, but from a Botswana/African perspective that can really shine a light where it needs to shine sometimes...The first book was especially good in portraying the Botswana background and viewpoint - I assume accuracy here as the author lived there a long time. The author seemed to move away from this as the series progressed; a disappointment for me, even though the books were still interesting. The good news is that I think the author is headed back in the right direction here with the last few books...As an aside, the TV series is great too; last time I looked into the matter, it does not look like the series with continue into a second season, but there is talk of a movie which is better than nothing. Most of the characters in the TV series were about as I had pictured them from the book - the main exception being Mma Makutsi. The actress that played her did a great job though; she just looked a little different from how I had pictured her from the book...Now on to the new book itself. I am happy to see that this new book stays closer to the series roots in many respects showing us some more about the real Botswana. The overall plot seems very vigorous too. I won't go into that too much as readers usually like a surprise, but here's a look at main story lines in the new book without giving things away...Remember the tiny white van that Mma Precious Ramotswe has been so attached to in the series? It is gone, but she is seeing visions of it. Hmm, that sounds like an interesting phenomenon. Where will this go? You'll have to read the book to find out...At a cattle post, two cows have been killed, and Mma Ramotswe is asked to investigate. Lots of suspects as it turns out, making it a challenge for our favorite Botswanan lady detective. Does she solve the mystery? No spoilers here, you'll have to read the book to find out...One of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's apprentices may have gotten a girl pregnant; he runs away when pressure builds to marry her. Will those young men ever finish their apprenticeships and stay out of trouble?..The ""villianess"", Violet Sephotho, is back. Remember her? She did horribly at the secretarial college when Mma Makutsi was there and shows up now and then to make poor Grace miserable. Anyway, Violet is running for the Botswana Parliament. They'd have to be desperate to elect her. What is up with this? Well, you'll have to open up the book to find out...And a perfect pair of wedding shoes - series fans will be pretty sure that the ""shoephile"" Mma Makutsi must be involved with those. Will Phuti Radiphuti finally marry Grace? The title of the book seems to refer to a wedding happening, but will it be Grace's or for the run away apprentice? Again, I won't tell here - you'll have to read the book...Lots of interesting things are in store for readers here. I hope that series fans will come back and read this latest book, meet favorite characters again, be entertained, and learn something about Botswana and life in general as well.",
Not Recommended,"Too many books like this in the same vein and with the same concept of the criminal intent on harming the detective in charge of the case.  The actual crimes, quite sickening.",

Why Pay Full Price at the Bookstore?,"One of my children needed this book for school.  The bookstore was out of copies, so I turned to the Amazon.  Not only did I save money - bought this used - but its exactly the same book and while it was listed as ""good"" quality, it is really excellent quality - nearly brand new.  I highly recommend buying your books for work, school, or pleasure this way.",
Love it.,I am using this to teach my son logic. It is fantastic as he loves the illustrations.,
Good read,"This is book two from this author. I read the first book and ordered this from Amazon as well. It is a good read. Normally I do not read the same author two or three books in a row. For this one I read others while waiting for my order but I found that this would be a book best read right after reading her first novel. Otherwise it can be a bit confusing with the characters and events and may not excite the reader as much. Unfortunately, my buzz ran out because I had to try and remember things from her first novel.",
boring,not what I thought.,
Five Stars,"Great story, beautifully illustrated by Deborah Hocking.",
Oddly academic & needlessly stuffy for a general audience,"I'm not sure if Microsoft used non-native English speakers or simply those not used to writing for the general public.  Example:  on page 717 the DB() function is described.  Nowhere does the book say &#34;DB = declining balance.&#34;  Anyone who works in accounting would know what that means but the authors call it the &#34;geometric-degressive&#34; depreciation method.  Who, outside of academics, talks like that???  Even the examples are hard to follow.  I can live with digressions about tax consequence if only the writing was clear.  I've purchased several of the inside-out series of books and this is the first one that really disappointed.  Microsoft:  if Einstein can explain relativity in straightforward terms, why can't you use authors who write clearly, with a practical orientation?",=
A must read for all generations,"This is a wonderful read, not alone describing the courage of little known Irena Sendler, but also  three young women whose lives were greatly influenced by their research. Their history teacher is to be commended for his encouragement to them in this challenging effort.",
Today Hope is Front and Center!,"Absolutely loved this book, but have to admit I love Laurell Hamilton.  Blurb stated that it was compiled to give hope, and it does deliver.  I really like anthologies for 2 reasons, new authors and short stories.  Since I've always had a terrible time putting down a book, anthologies give me a chance to finish a story in a small fraction of time..Love that these are new stories, and especially liked Twilight Falls by Jonathan Maberry (made me think of today's COVID-19 pandemic), Reprise by John G. Hartness, and Asil and the Not-Date by Patricia Briggs, one of my very favorite authors.  Had no idea that Asil had been the recipient of more than one date, I'd read of another of his date nights in an earlier anthology.  Now I have to see if I missed the other 3 since I really like that old wolf!.Working Conditions by Patrick M. Tracy made me rethink an employee/employer relationship, and Ronin by William McCaskey, the co-editor, gave me a new appreciation of my old Teddy Bear.  Laurell reminded me how important follow-up is in her Zombie Dearest..All in all, this collection made me think, and really did offer hope in today's world.  And yes, I now have more ""new"" authors and looking forward to more hope!!",
Bane of the Spider Queen,"Originally published in 1990, R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy set in the Forgotten Realms shone like a beacon in the fantasy genre. It was, and still is, comparable to Tolkein's Lord of the Rings and Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman's Dragon Lance series and - like those - is still being sold in nearly every major bookstore today...Then, in 2005, Devil's Due Publishing (traditionally known for their G.I. Joe and Transformers comics) began releasing a comic adaptation of the story with a script by Andrew Dabb and wonderfully detailed pencils by Tim Seeley...Naturally the full plot of the novels can't be fit into three trade paperbacks, but all of the essentials are still there. We can see the development, decline and eventual resolution of the relationship between Drizzt Do'Urden and his father Zaknafein and, most importantly, the bond between Drizzt and the ever-faithful Guenhwyvar, his panther companion from the astral plane...Drizzt was born in the underdark beneath the ground in the drow city of Menzoberranzan, a city run by the female priests of the dark spider goddess Lolth who relishes only evil and treachery. Brought up in a society so far detached from our own we would die within a day even if not for our pale skin, Drizzt is raised to be a ruthless and cunning killer...But Drizzt is born different from his kin and kind. He possesses an unimpeachable sense of honor despised by the spider queen who seeks only his death to ""appease"" for the good he has done, such as saving the life of a surface dweller in a drow raid aboveground...Rather than face certain death at the hands of his own family in order to restore their honor, Drizzt ventures out into the underdark with only Guenhwyvar at his side. But for the most reviled of the intelligent races in the realms it will be difficult to survive in the most dangerous corridors of the underdark. Thus must Drizzt journey to the surface to face a world unknown to any drow before him...The artwork in these comics is just astounding. Although much of the action takes place in the bleak environs of the underdark, the art remains colorful and vivid. Never have I wanted to visit a place so dangerous. The action is well wrought and never leaves you with a sense of confusion despite the numerous fights between Drizzt, who expertly wields two scimitars in battle, and the numerous horrors of the underdark and surface...Despite lacking the complexity and depth of the original novels, this is a series well worth adding to your collection.",

"Clear, concise, easy to read description of the failure of science to explain the origin of life on Earth","Wells and Dembski are smart, clear, thinkers and their writing reflects their no nonsense style of providing the essential arguments that have been tried, and failed, by science to describe and replicate the emergence of life from non-life.  Describing how life came to exist on the planet in the first place is one of the key issues of our existence.  Did a couple of rocks bounce together during a volcanic eruption 4.9 billion years ago and create a complex cell complete with DNA and interacting molecules and a genetic code?  That is one tough problem to determine how that could have happened. No experiment, no hypothesis, no accident comes close to explaining how intelligent information was created in a self replicating cell in the first place.  Wells and Dembski give a quick, readable overview of all the failed hypothesis and then make a good case for intelligent design of life!  This is and interesting, quick, and comprehensions explanation of the status and problems of the science, and a defense of intelligent design that is accessable to the layman.",
Perfect for your tiny dancer!,Love this adorable story! My niece enjoys it!,
WTF did I just buy?,I did not know what Acquisitions was. This is not your typical D&D book. Do yourself a favor and research this before buying.,
Great buy!,Bought for my son. He loves it!,
A great first entry,"This review is based on an Advanced Reader's Edition provided as part of the Amazon Vine program...This is Cherie Priest's first foray into the world of Modern Dark Fantasy.  On the surface, it's pretty typical.  Female vampire protagonist.  Did I mention she's a thief/private investigator, and hot?  It has a few twists.  The first is that the client is a vampire, a blind vampire.  The other odd thing is that its written from the first person.  To be honest, I found this to be pretty refreshing.  You get to really experience the story from Raylene's point of view.  There are a couple of other real twists to the story, which I really didn't predict...I really enjoyed this book, and will be looking for future Raylene Pendle novels.",
Enjoying,Great series ! This one may be the best ?,

Also, in the index, they had the poses separated for strength and tone, and for stretching..That was very helpful because I really do not have time to do all 37 poses..So it was broken down for what you are doing yoga for..With the pictures, it was also written how to get in the poses and hold it..The only thing I did not like about the book was that it did not tell me how to breath while doing the positions..Also, the photos could have been real people. The pictures were cartoons. But, that is why I have google..I have received this book for free. The above statement is solely my opinion and I was not persuaded in any way..I would definitely recommend this book to anyone starting out. Good book !",
Healthy cooking,Love it.  Just wish it came with the accessories.  Use it 4 to 5 times a week,
Of Choices and Word Paintings,"L.M. Ross's The Moanin' After is a book about choices--choosing to live, choosing to die, and choosing to forgive.  In this, Ross's second novel, we follow his protagonist David on his harrowing journey through grief.  Ross beautifully shows us that grief is not a solitary process.  David touches lives in his quest to understand and accept the deaths of his friends Face Depina and, most importantly, Tyrone Hunter...And author Ross also makes choices.  Ross has grown as a writer since his first novel.  In it, Manhood The Longest Moan, Ross used his gloriously beautiful figures of speech to excess.  He created six or eight metaphors, similes, etc., and strung them together.  In The Moanin' After, Ross wisely chooses the two or three best of his creations to make his points.  And he makes them amazingly.  The reader can revel in his descriptions.  A poet at heart, Ross knows his subjects:  jazz, New York City, gay life, and what it means to be a Black man.  His word portraits rapturously evoke, sometimes bringing chills down the spine...If anyone deserves a deal with a major publisher, it is Ross.  An editor at Little Brown, Simon and Schuster, Clarion, or any of the other ""big"" publishers could work with Ross and turn him from a very good writer into a great one.  The man knows how to use words in a commanding and beautiful way.  He truly deserves better than his present editor and publisher...His current publisher apparently is dedicated to bringing African-American writers to the marketplace.  What a fine and noble goal!  But when every page has five to fifteen errors, how can this publisher be taken seriously?  The reader is forced to wade through sentences filled with repeated words and words left out.  Time and time again, verbs of two different tenses (think ""was""/ ""were"") are both given, as if the reader might want a choice in the sentence.  Or could it be the editor or proofreader couldn't make the choice him or herself?  And the commas!  My lord, my lord...they are just thrown in willy-nilly.  Someone needs to send this editor a grammar book--STAT!..L.M. Ross needs to be read, not decoded.  If there is a publishing god out there, please let Her send an angel to plop Ross's next manuscript on the desk of an editor familiar with the English language...Ross serves the gay community, the Black community, and the community at large with his humanity and his word paintings.  Read The Moanin' After--it has power and grace.  And after you read it, pass your copy on to your publisher friend...you know, the one who sits in an ivory tower office in Manhattan, waiting for the next great African-American author.",
Love it So Much I Bought Another,"I bought a second one for a Christmas gift. This cookbook is BEAUTIFULLY photographed, easy to follow, and heartwarming.  Five Stars from our family.",
Very Cute!,My friend who loves cats is going to absolutely love this for her Christmas present!  Can't wait to give it to her!,
Love the crossover,I really enjoyed this book. I love all the characters and how well they merged. The storyline was fun and had some good twists and action scenes. I was disappointed in how abruptly the story ended. It would have benefited from a wrap up chapter to tie up the loose ends. It didn’t feel finished.,
More fun than a barrel of monkeys!,"The story is terrific, and the writing is super! I write myself, and simply can't imagine trying to keep track of the plot with all the side quips and comments from Chet. The funny thing is that I had a dog who made very obvious non-verbal remarks like this all the time, but I don't think he was quite as smart as Chet. He'd never have found his way home across a desert like that...Chet really MAKES the story, that's for sure. Just wish Mr. Quinn would write more, faster!!",
Great!,Super cute and good message.  Good for toddlers and early elementary.,
Just as good as 2014,Paper quality is very similar if not the same as 2014 edition. The cover also tends to fold over like 2014 edition. New graphs/illustrations  and revisions are very good. Better then 2014 version. Do wish cover was sturdier.,
This book is not my friend!,"I cannot recall why this book was on my &#34;to read&#34; list. Had I read a review? Did a friend recommend it to me?.Even after finishing the book, I am really not sure if I liked it..There were things in Bev and Amy's relationship that I could relate to, but over all, not sure it was a good representation of the evolution of a friendship..I give this book 2.5 stars, but for this review I have decided to round down.",
Pizzolatto has captured the landscape of the south in interesting and strange short stories,Pizzolatto is a talented fiction writer. Galveston is a wonderful short novel and of course season one of True Detective was one of the best series every on television. I recommend this to anyone who likes literary fiction and enjoys the landscape of the south. He is a master with words. Hopefully season three of TD will be good.,
beginners level,too basic for me,
She loved the logo,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend who is a total parrot head!  She loved the logo. If the material was a bit thicker, it would have been given five stars for the quality.",
Makes My Niece Happy,My 7yo niece loves this book.  Her mom texted me &#34;she hasn't gotten her face out of this book since it arrived&#34; which is all I need to hear.,
Slow moving but intriguing premise of disturbing psychological influence,"This book is suspenseful in a very slow way. I found the premise intriguing- participating in a psychological experiment of sorts that becomes a little twisted and reality is blurred from the manipulation. In actuality, I wouldn’t put much emphasis on the blurred reality part of the advertised summary- not really the plot. There’s times Jessica wonders if an everyday encounter is part of the experiment but it’s not really a ‘is she losing her mind’ kind of manipulation...Jessica enters a psychology study to earn more money for her family and the conductor of the study, Dr. Shields (no relation to me), takes a special interest in Jessica and asks more and more of her in future parts of the study. So there’s this mystery of why Dr Shields is doing this study, why such an interest in Jessica, what happened to Subject 5, and can Dr Shields’ spouse be trusted? To be honest, I was expecting darker answers to those questions than what turned out to be the case. I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I thought there would be a little more pulse-pounding action instead of neatly wrapping everything up with a bow...But I would still recommend this book. It was still engaging and as a psych minor, I enjoyed the psychology intertwined within, a lot of the referenced psych studies I remember from my classes. As long as you don’t go into it expecting a lot of intense action and suspense I think you’ll really like the story and seeing how things unfold. And it’s kinda a freaky scenario to think about. The implications of something like this happening, of a therapist having such personal information and manipulating clients and having the capability to affect and influence their life is definitely worth exploring in a psychological thriller like this...One writing style thing to mention: the chapters alternate POVs. It’s either told from Jessica’s point of view (3rd person) where we can hear her thoughts or from Dr. Shields’ (first person). But with Dr. Shields’ chapters it’s almost in letter or diary form directly addressing Jessica- which I didn’t really like. It definitely makes it more creepy I suppose, but some of the vocabulary or descriptions seemed unnatural for that type of writing... All in all- good book, will probably read others written by these authors.",
Huh...,"This the first book I read in the series and it will probably be my last, I made it about 45% through the book and realized this story just wasn't doing it for me. Sometimes it can be intriguing or even sexy to read about the taboo or forbidden this book (even though it's supposed to be about those things) seemed to lean more towards the main male character being creepy and the female naive and ignorant than sheltered and innocent. There also wasn't enough relationship build up between the creepy fake uncle that has random flashbacks of his niece in name only when she's young enough to be wearing pigtails and said fake niece. Needless to say, this one wasn't for me.",
Its a keeper!,"This book has the recipes I've been wanting. Using fresh ingredients in simple, easy to follow directions has so far worked out great. We're all trying to eat fresh and simple. This book is a great help with that. I'll be cooking these recipes often. Who knew Freddie was such a professionally trained chef? I didn't til I read his book.",
A good book for kids,A good book to read and discuss with children about being respectful.,
Fun and imaginative book with lots of twists,"Obert Skye (if that's his real name....) is indeed showing to the world what a talented author he is. He really hits home with the second installment of the Leven Thumps series. Poor Leven never seems to get much of a rest, this book is no exception it starts out fast and furious and keeps going all the way up to the cliff hanging end...The writing is clean ( parents should have no problems with their kids reading this book) the action is intense and non stop and the characters are fun and full of life. How could you not like a main character that is a tooth pick? This book is very imaginative and very cleaver. I wish it didn't end and I really wish I didn't have to wait another year or two for the next one.",
Wow!,Perfect gift for the MH lover you drool over!,
Five Stars,very helpful,
Exciting story with twists all around,"This is the best of the Bookshots stories I've read to date. The story is well-plotted, well-written, and well-edited. The characters are consistent with those in the longer Private books, so those I'd met before were instant old friends. The story involves the kidnapping of a Duke's daughter, and the action takes us around London in the chase to rescue her. There are new revelations and twists throughout, and I was rooting for them to rescue her before it was too late. Avery enjoyable story by a master writing team.",
Guilt a good book,I enjoyed it. I thought it had some great twists and turns. Nice combining of the two overlapping baby deaths. I recommend it!,
Admiral Corin Mendenhall,"He was one of our WWII heroes, and never was honored for his sacrifices.  The book is very well written telling us of submarine life few of us knew.  He'll be missed.",
I was expecting an amazing love story,i felt that the story wasn't going anywhere.. I was expecting an amazing love story.. It was boring.,
Wonderful book - the real romance of travel that is fast disapearing,"This is a wonderful book that reminds you of when travel was an adventure before globalization made it a packaged commodity. Anyone who loves the romance of travel and can get their hands on a copy should jump on it. The country and people are among the most interesting I have read about, the writer is a real person that takes you with him in a book that seems like what a friend would write back to you. This is a story that includes such things as writing to a Russian cartographer asking where on the map he thinks the true origin of one of the Asia's longest rivers is, meeting a forest ranger in a remote land who had always wanted to find it for himself and setting out through hundreds of miles untracked wilderness to get there. The Mongolian people are unique and you will find no references to a McDonald's. Their country is still theirs. This is a gem of a book.",
Really helps,Excellent product.veru helpful,
Five Stars,Excellent !,
A disservice to metaphysics and science alike.,"This did nothing to prove to me that there is any science behind The Secret. The author, though clearly an accomplished scientist, offers no empirical evidence of The Secret at work. He only makes comparisons and allusions between quantum theory and metaphysics. It's a disservice to both followers of metaphysics and science.",
Five Stars,This is a good book for dad's who live sports. My husband enjoyed it.,
Good book,I liked the interaction between characters. The young girl 's ability to adapt to such difficult circumstances and learn to not only care for herself but to show compassion for others is remarkable.,
Five Stars,Love this book!,
My Favorite Sweary Coloring Book To Date!,"[[VIDEOID:dc646dd551205b4ee04395ffa32ab969]] This is such a good Sweary Adult Coloring Book. I absolutely love the vulgar in this one LOL. This book is a little smaller than a normal sheet of paper but the designs in it are awesome if you like to swear. There is a lot of detail to color on each page so this book will definitely keep you busy for awhile. What a great way to de-stress after work or a long or rough day...The pages are all one sided which I prefer. If using markers or gel pens, I definitely recommend placing a few sheets of blank paper in between the pages so they don't mark through. The page thickness is that of a normal piece of computer paper roughly. The pages are not perforated so they will not tear out unless you just rip them out neatly if you wanted to remove any...Overall, this is my favorite Sweary Coloring Book I have to date. Some of the books claim to have a lot of vulgar in them but they don't. this has a lot of &quot;colorful words&quot; in it that are just awesome! In my video, I show all the pages that come in the book so you can see everything in it and decide if it's for you. I however would definitely recommend it!.I received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.",
My bible,"If you don't want to change - don't bother with this book. But, if you are a seeker, if you have the courage for your ""journey"" and want to connect more deeply to Life and those you care about, then this book is for you...I bought a case and gave them to every weary heart I loved, kept it by my nightstand (the true test of a good book), and feel it offers the insights of a bible. Every ounce of me recommends this book.",
Mrs Parsons is an excellent author and,"we can always use more literature of this nature , uplifting, encouraging . Mrs Parsons is an excellent author and teacher",
I don't get it...,"Gee, so much hype about this book, how could I not read it? But now that I'm finished, I can't undrstand the hype.....The story began well, with enough intrigue to make me wonder what the heck was wrong with this picture. And the language of the story (the writing itself) was very pleasing to follow.  But about half way through, after we discovered what was really happening with Amy, the plot became (in my opinion) implausible and a little silly.  The mystery started off seriously enough but then deviated into a soap opera tale of !megalomaniacal treachery! None of the potential plot lines from first part of the story were developed into anything diabolical ( e.g. the purchase of the gun, Nick's father's strange behavior at the housewarming, Amy's cryptic friendship with Noelle)--most of the mystery was dropped altogether--and then all of a sudden I was forced to accept an unbelievable (& I mean really not believable) turn of events unfitting of the characters thus far developed.  It was not like &#34;Wow! I didn't see THAT coming!!&#34; , it was more like &#34;No way! It wouldn't (or shouldn't) happen like that!!&#34;..Another issue for me, that I realized about 3/4 of the way through, was that the main characters, Nick and Amy, were falsely developed. The first part of the story portrayed them, in depth, to be certain personalities, but then those were discarded in exchange for the more wicked traits of the revealed characters. I understand that this was supposed to be the big twist, but the second-part Nick and Amy were never really fleshed out to make them believable.  I felt as if I never had a grasp on Nick's character at all--was he a handsome streetwise literary? A small-minded, small-town dullard? A scheming, twisted match for his sociopathic wife? How was Amy ever beautiful and gracious, if she was only ever calculative and malevolent? And at what point did they become poison for each other? I was never made to understand how their relationship became a &#34;sick, toxic M&ouml;bius strip&#34;:  that would suggest long-standing dysfunction, but that part of their story was not written here.  I felt that, in order to appreciate the grand turn-of-events, I had to blindly accept that Amy, and to an extent, Nick, were, and had always been, evil...I have many other small issues with the plot, and was perplexed by the resignation of the ending, but suffice it to say that a story with great potential for intrigue and complexity veered off to become a typical bland, superficial, best-seller-list mystery (in my opinion).",
Five Stars,Thank you!!!,

A Great Read!,This book was one of the best haunted house/ghost story that I have read in a long time. This book captured my attention from the first page and just kept getting better and better. I thought the ending was pretty shocking. I thank Netgalley for the opportunity to read and review this book and I look forward to reading more books by this author.,
A great book!,My kids went nuts when this came! It's a very fun book!,

My comment is more of a standing ovation. 2016 ...,"My comment is more of a standing ovation. 2016, we have a woman running for president. We (women) have come a long way since the Suffragette movement began all over the world.  I saw the movie Iron Jawed Angels in 2004 and that movie alone inspired me to register to vote. I saw the movie Suffragette movie this year and its interesting how these women played a role in the lives we live today. I am so grateful, so honored and humbled that these women fought for what they felt was right. After reading this book, it opened my eyes to understand that 100 plus years ago, I was nothing more than property to a man. He was entitled to every possession I owned. I had no say to anything.... Anything!! How can you thank these women for what they did for us?  Vote!!!! Its 2016, you don't  have to vote for a woman candidate but vote for someone and let your voice be heard.  Vote!!!",
Five Stars,Love this book.,
Could not finish this nonsense,"I can't believe how awful this series has become.  When I started with the first book in this series, I was delighted with the setting, the characters and the plot.  This last book was so bad I couldn't finish it.  Fully the first 40% of the plot involves Bay and Landon arguing about nothing, very much like a pair of 5-year-olds..  Bay's family says she has become Whiny.  That is an understatement.  The characters of Bay and, to some extent, Landon have become inane and vapid.  Altogether a most disappointing read.",
Great series.. read it with your kids,This is one of those series I have loved reading with my kiddos.  They are well written and keep you entertained.  Great for an advanced 1st or second grader.,

Finally - a baby book with bengali/english words!,"The pictures are nice, and baby seems to like looking at them (she's 8 months old). However the bengali names of animals and colors are written in the bengali script, which isn't great for my husband (who doesn't speak bengali) to be able to read the bengali version to our baby (or himself!)",
Incredibly well written,"Woah! The ending just blew me away! Need to Know is incredibly well written. The suspense build and builds, and then just when the reader thinks it is okay to breathe a sigh of relief it all ramps up again.

Comical It's So Bad,"I borrowed this book/DVD set from the library on a whim, and was leafing through the book when I noticed a some pictures in the Ground Fighting chapter that were straight out an entry-level jiu jitsu class when the instructor says, ""never do this"".  After studying various martial arts for a decade, I couldn't believe that the author was advocating passing a closed guard with one arm inside and the other outside of the opponent's locked legs, not to mention pictures of arm bars with the opponent's thumb pointing in the wrong direction, making the submission largely ineffective.  Then I flipped back through to the standup fighting techniques and began to notice some things that had evaded my first perusal: a ball-of-the-foot roundhouse kick, and the kind of old-school karate blocks look pretty badass in a kata, but will get you beaten to a pulp on the street.  While there are some effective, proven techniques in this book, there are also some maneuvers that could either get you hurt, or, in a best-case scenario, laughed at..Thinking that the DVD could only be better, I gave that a try.  This was pure comedy, showcasing two stickly guys throwing half speed punches with the form of eight-year-old girls.  I can't believe this footage hasn't gone viral yet.  There was little to no editing as they were constantly readjusting the four tumbling mats that they had set up, and were often whispering instructions to one another.  At one point, the sound of a fire truck siren lingered outside of the building until they shut off the microphone and continued in silence.  I won't even get into this DVD's other home-movie production values.  Anyway, the whole thing was so bad, it was good..I would not recommend this to anyone unless they needed a good laugh.",

interesting,Interesting read but outdated. Don't understand why my biopsyc teacher wants us to read such an outdated book. Interesting cotect though.,
easy to read but flawed,"I found this a page turner, but I was really turned off by the &quot;hero&quot; smoking dope and giving it to his girlfriend, with whom he  goes to bed practically as soon as he gets a chance.  Other than some of  the moral aspects of the protagonist's character, this boook moves right  along, even tho its plot is simplistic.  I may read its sequel",
I don't understand the critism,"I don't really understand the lengths I've seen people go to to discredit this book or the 12 steps in general. I am not a member of AA but I have a family member who was saved literally from the brink of death by NA. The changes in her and in her life have been nothing short of miraculous. If it was a 'cult' that brought about this change in her then I say Thank God for the 12-step cult, for it is truly a force of good.",

Do not buy this book - each page is blank,This book is a trick.  It is meant to be a joke but nothing in the write up says that.  Each page is blank stating that there are not any reasons why cats are better than dogs.  Do not buy this book.  Rip off.  Amazon should pull this.,
Amazing price,Came super fast and just what was needed.,

Fun read,"I liked it. A Galapagos cruise certainly sold this book for me. Yes there were some obvious plot ploys with the hot sister and the cringey boss but it didn’t stop my enjoyment of the book.

Not as enjoyable as Henry V,"I read parts 1 and 2 of Henry VI to close out my New Year’s resolution. I didn’t like these two as much as Henry V. None of the characters are particularly likeable, and it’s mostly just a bunch of noblemen squabbling over succession.",
"Good Story, but....","A lot of the dialog was overlong and tedious, and made for pages of tiresome reading...It just didn't move as well as it should...Not as good as some of Ms Johansen's other books.",

numerous characters a bit distracting but solid writing throughout,"I discovered Lois Menzel through an anthology and began to actively seek out her Regency romances. This is the 3rd of her books I've read and it was very enjoyable. I thought there was solid writing throughout. There were numerous themes and sub themes and at one point I found myself asking ""who again is Harriett?"" So many characters to follow. But overall a well written book with none of the meaningless repetitions you find in more current regency romances - what I call fillers. I can just imagine an editor saying this book is good but not long enough and some poor writer having to find words to fill up the number of required pages. Lois was a teacher as well as an accomplished writer and the kindle I just received should make reading her complete works much easier.",
Great story.,"Bohjalian is a wonderful author and the storyline was very interesting and a great read..His book the Sand Castle Girls was a great read and of the book he commented,  &#34;Single most important book I'll ever write.&#34;  A very meaningful and personal book for Bohjalian.  Will be reading many more of his books.",

Great Story,This coming of age story is completely intriguing from the first page. It kept my interest to the point I hated to put it down until I was finished and then didn't want it to end. The story setting and characters are realistic and believable. An excellent book.,
I'm keeping this one.,"This book is complete, thorough, and a very good work book.  It doesn't take anything for granted, like many math books I've tried to use in the past have - like (and I've had math teachers tell me this), &#34;Well, this is just something you should know.&#34;..It offers (as stated on the book's back cover) all topics broken down into lessons, practice problems, step-by-step example problems and free online access to more practice problems...The history of numbers is told (it's an interesting section) in the clear, plain language that is used throughout the entire book.  It covers addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and continues on to more difficult mathematics.  The book explains why things are done, not just how.  I think it is very much worth the price and I'm keeping it in my library for a reference book.",
Pocahontas: Free and then Almost Aristocrat,"Got for my 10 yr old granddaughter. With a Cherokee Aunt, I grew up with great respect, love and compassion for our First Settlers.

The only story of this courageous young (probably a late teen), Her true story is still epic; however, her end is sad but necessary for all to know.",

Side story of Nexus series,"This story picks up the side story from where the Nexus, Abby, insists that the human halfbreeds with affinity to magic be brought into the fold, matched with mentors and taught how to access and use their magic.  This is also the story of Sophie and her mentor, a relative of Zander's named Raffin.  IMO, not really book 2.5 and can be read after Pixies in the Park...I would recommend that a person read this series in the following order regardless of how the order is stated in the descriptions:..Raven Dexter, Paranormal Midwife.Impractical Magus.Chubby Is The Night.Gnomes of Suburbia.Gargoyles in the Round.A Nexus Xmas.Pixies In The Park.Hotel Spectre.A Nexus Wedding",

A Page Turner,Loved this true story of love and endurance.,
well-crafted but not exactly an easy read,"Yes, this book is haunting and lyrical.  It is as much poetry as it is prose.  The writing is bare-boned and sparse, each word carefully chosen.  I think this would appeal to some readers, but from my perspective, it was a bit too unadorned.  I couldn't quite tell where it was set (Africa?  the US?  desert or vacated surburbia?), I had a hard time keeping track of who was narrating, I found the descriptions from the dog's perspective to be odd and confusing, and I didn't know enough details about the characters to find them particularly compelling...My sense is that this would be a good book for classroom reading, providing fodder for thought and meaningful discussion, but I'm not sure I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a breezy, entertining read.  The ending is a bit of a downer, and the whole book is humorless and somewhat slow-paced.  I felt like I was plodding through a parched dessert when reading it.  The book is quite well-crafted, so I don't have much criticism of the book itself -- I just think it has limited appeal.",
Enjoyable and surreal,"I was given a review copy by the author and voluntarily reviewed it...I really enjoyed this little collection of stories. I was impressed by the surreal, almost dream-like atmosphere created in Stammlager 76. The story left me with more questions than answers but I had a good time reading it. The Man in the Dark Chocolate Suit was also surreal and quite unsettling and intense. I loved the sense of foreboding created. We of the Future are the Ghosts of the Past is also effective and my favourite in the collection. This story is also surreal and a little bit creepy. I thought it was great. I enjoyed the title story but found it the weakest in the collection. It is enjoyable but just not as strong as the other stories. Maybe there’s something about slugs that unnerve me? Anyway, this is a good collection of stories. I’d recommend it.",
Really really dissapointing,This is one of the worst books that i ever forced myself to finish. The present wasnt that bad but the past portion was pointless. It didnt connect the two and made you sit and hope that something made sense but it never did.,

Good,Doesn't have all the words my 8 year old needs to look up but it is plenty good.,
A MUST READ,When I realized that I am more bio-electric... than chemical... which somewhere inside  I already knew.... But the application of sound  to the bio-field and its correction to the magnetic body is short of a miracle....  MUST READ>>MUST EXPERIENCE!!,>>
Healthy Approach To Healthy Food,This book was adorable! Not only does it have a mixed couple making it relatable to my family but it comes from children's perspective on foods. So very well done. I tell everyone about it!,
John Maxwell is Amazing!,"John Maxwell is the best leadership guru in the world!  His stuff is always on point, and needed!",
"Has your pet dog passed away or, do you know of someone whose dog died? YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK!","LOVE this book! It is PERFECT as a gift to someone  whose dog passed away, or, for a teacher of primary aged children, whose dog has died.",
Found it boring,Seemed too disgenuous somehow. Just not for me.,
Extremely Boring and Bloodless,"This is the most boring and bloodless Abercrombie novel I've ever read. Went on vacation in Sweden and bought this book to read on the ride back home. Fell asleep literally while flipping through the first few pages. It's strange too, because I love the &#34;First Law&#34; books. But I'm probably going to sell this on Amazon to get some worth out of it. Or, give it to charity. I certainly won't let it take up room on my bookshelf.",
excellent read!,"It's very obvious that this book is written by a woman, and that she's a Jazz fanatic.  That said, you can learn a lot about both, and enjoy a fun mystery.  One more thing, for those uninitiated to Jazz (like myself).  You'll definitely start looking through YouTube for Coltrane, Evans, Monk and more.",
Great gift,Bought for myself and as a gift. Very funny and goes for a great cause!,
Nice size for coffee table decor,Beautiful book for coffee table and horse lovers!!,
"Great price, easy read, fun stories!","My son is in the first grade, age 7, and reads at a Level L/M. These are perfect for his age group and reading level and he absolutely loves the pictures and story lines. I would recommend purchasing the whole series if you have a reader who is interested in monster books with pictures that are set up in chapters. These will not disappoint.",
Ellery Knows How To Tell A Mystery Story!!!,"First, I want to thank Ellery Kane for providing me with this book so I may bring you this review...WOW What an amazing read from Ellery Kane with the Hanging Tree!!! She was not kidding when it said right on the cover some nights were left unforgotten!! This is the second book I have read from her and she did not disappoint me! I love her writing style and chilling story line that draws you into the story like no other does. Now every time I see a big hanging tree it will give me chills!!..This book had everything from widowers, hitch hiking, creepy guys, blasts from the past that you didn’t want to see, murders, investigations, almost rapes, flashbacks to when Evie was young, child molesters, etc...After reading this book I am never hitch hiking that is for sure!! That Evie was a brave soul! That guy that picked her up was a creepy dude. The author did an incredible job with that whole scene! She made me so fearful for her character!..So many times the book jumps from modern day to back in the day to tell the story. This is so important so you know what happened...I loved the mystery of the fact that Evie knew who Culder was from her past but couldn’t put her finger on it. Everyone has those moments where they know someone but cant figure out how they know them. Then it hits them and it is like oh wow!..Overall amazing book by a talented writer! I would definitely read from her again.",
Humble beginning from a great comic!,She was so honest and funny - like listening to a friend tell her story (Audible),
Read Only if there's nothing else,"In reality this is one of the books that I'm baffled is considered a classic. I very much enjoy reading, and I am by no means opposed by long books. But this was too much for its length.  None of the main characters a likable, not even jane.  The descriptions are also much too long for my liking, and the ending is in reality is not believable in the slightest.  The man she falls in love with suddenly speaks and acts so vastly different In The last chapter it's jarring to read.  Skip this book unless it's a necessity.",
So Proud,"OMG! Mr. King, I am just so darned proud of you. :)  You really have just thrown yourself into your craft since you got off the junk.  I heart Wireman.  And I'm ever so fond of your words.  Thank you, for another really well written story.",
Love Taste of Home,"I have come to the conclusion I should be a spokesperson for Taste of Home :)  Sounds silly, but I have over 10 cookbooks and all have been used.  The healthier cooking has helped me lose over 20 pounds.  I would recommend their cookbooks to anyone!",
Buy A Better Quality Book on the Same Topic,"This book was not what I thought that it would be. The recipes were uninspiring and lacked the quality that Dr. Steven R. Gundry, MD, had in the recipe section of his book, &#34;The Plant Paradox&#34;. I would recommend buying that book, instead.",
Skillful angst,"I downloaded this album from emusic.com, having never heard of the band before.  I was totally impressed.

Very good,Excellent.,
Good practice,Good for drill,
So GOOD!!!,"What a fantastic story.  Boy howdy, was I ever surprised by the twists and turns in this novel!  The characters are described so well that I felt I knew them, saw what they saw, and felt what they felt..Outstanding second book by this talented author.  Highly recommended.",
I'd give this book 10 stars if I could! ...,I'd give this book 10 stars if I could! I love-love-love Dwyanna's work! She is definitely a top of the line artist!,
more confusing than anything,A story without an end. Who's on first and where is Eve. Where did Frank get the money? Where is old man Murphy? Was he in it too?.Stories like this I can do without. $4 and some hours I will never get back.,$
Comprehensive !,Perfect guidance for any food.establishment ...Essential reading !,
Disappointing,I am a great fan of Martin Cruz Smith but I agree with others that this was one of his weakest works. It reads as if he has lost interest in his characters. The plotting was weak and the conclusion risible.,
Funny,"Bought as gift for a 12 year old. She loves it, the rest of the family not so much. Hahahaha.",
A rollicking romp through space and time,"I'm a big fan of alternate history novels, and this is one of the first I read...It's an upbeat what-if tale that explores what could happen if a town in West Virginia suddenly appeared in Germany in, of course, 1632 AD...The characters are diverse. The heros are earthy types that I can personally relate to. From Swedish king Gustav Adolf to Jewish refugee Rebecca Abrabanel to expert markswoman and high school cheerleader Julie Sims, I really related...The central idea of a blue collar American town in war-ravaged Germany four centuries back was intriguing. I am writing this after reading the book for the second time, and I have to say that sitting here in Baghdad, I was struck by what author Eric Flint had to say near the novel's climax regarding the foolishness of building a fortress America and exporting our ideas militarily...What makes America great is freedom. Our ideas about freedom are ever changing, and they change for the characters in this book as the plot unfolds. You owe it to yourself to read this delightful and ultimately optimistic tale of American greatness and bringing hope into a hopeless world, despite often daunting odds.",
For Parents,I love this book.  I always give it to new parents and the end always bring tears to my eyes.  What can I say?  I'm sentimental.,
absolutely different,"Faith Hunter has captured an entirely different aspect to this genre that I wasn't quite sure of when I began this book. But there's something special about it. maybe it's the setting or the introduction of the Seraphs. Her writing almost has a dark feeling to it. If you're looking for something entirely different, Faith Hunter will fill that void...I just wish this book had been longer. It was almost a novelette.",
Wonderful to re-read this,What can I say except that I hadn't read the book since I got it in paperback ages ago and it was a real treat to read it again on my Kindle Fire..To those who have seen the movies but never read the first novel....do yourself a favor and dive right in..There's so much more content than covered in the movie. Of course the ratings and standards at that time never would have permitted a lot of it! Not that it's salacious...but what got left out in the movie really helps you understand the characters' motivations better..Go ahead...you know you want to.,

Not as good as the first,"Not as good as the first, but a quality sequel. Love the plot and message and the rhyme is pretty good too. Wish we could have seen more of Bob in it!

So much fun,"Zentangle Dingbatz is a new tutorial guide for alternative and additional Zentangle techniques by Brian Crimmins. Released 11th June 2019 by Fox Chapel on their Design Originals imprint, it's 160 pages and available in paperback format...Zentangle is an accessible, fun, and valuable creativity exercise which packs a lot of mindfulness and stimulation into a very short time commitment. They're also really really fun to do. These extra techniques can be used on a variety of surfaces and in a variety of sizes. For readers who are previously unfamiliar with the process, the introductory chapter in this book explains the process including a step by step visual tutorial...The book has an easily accessible and logical layout. The introduction (~17% of the page content) introduces basic Zentangle concepts, starting instructions, and supplies for doing the projects. The next chapter provides the reader with a thorough tutorial showing the differences between the basic Zentangle tile art and 'Dingbatz' alternatives...The next chapters include specific project tutorials and inspiration including stationery, a handwritten 'zine, place cards, nametags, gift tags, journals, and several more.  Each of the chapters include a self-practice workbook area...The final chapter includes a tangle gallery with tutorials for some of the tangle elements used in the book. There is also a brief acknowledgement section with some references for further reading (including the facebook group mention), as well as an author statement and a short index...This is a useful, energetic, and accessible tutorial for all things Dingbatz.  The author has a refreshingly encouraging voice and readers of all levels of expertise can use this guide to produce beautifully useful finished objects. The style of zentangle art makes them organic and structured at the same time. I really love the look of them...This would make a superlative gift along with some pens and tiles or a journal for a drawing friend (or oneself)...Five stars.  Well written, superbly photographed, accessible, and complete...Disclosure: I received an ARC at no cost from the author/publisher for review purposes.",~
Disappointing,"When you read a plot about 12 female secret agents who were deployed out of London during the war to the front lines as spies and to pass information on to the Allied sympathizers and supporters, as a history buff you jump right in!  But this... this novel made women come off as incompetent and run purely by emotion and love than logic and survival.  I had really high hopes from the plot but the author did not present strong, capable women.",
"Enchanting, Mesmerizing, Sad and Joyful","I loved listening to this book on Audible. The narrator was fantastic. It truly makes such a difference when a good story is read aloud well. I felt so mesmerized by her voice and the words of this book...the writing is just exceptional and it is spellbinding at times..I also felt there were so many lessons to learn from this story about abandonment, prejudice, nature and love..I think it would make a fabulous movie or drama series. Would love to see it on screen!.Just so glad I happened upon this book on Amazon!.Hope to read more from this author and listen to other stories read by this narrator.",
Difficult subject,"3.5 Stars. Slimy men, tiny but fierce women, and a difficult plot or maybe it’s just me.",
Fun and thoughtful!,"When Alice Love falls and hits her head on the gym, all her memories from the past ten years disappear. She thinks she's a twenty-nine year old in love with her husband and expecting her first child. In reality, she's a soon-to-be divorced thirty-nine year old with three kids. Alice must get to know her thirty-nine year old self and try to figure out how she got to where she is in her life. Of course, everyone in her life has also changed in ten years and she has to get used to that as well...I loved the pacing of the story and how the author revealed information about the ten year gap in Alice's memory in bits and pieces. It was suspenseful enough that I could not put the book down but not so suspenseful that I got frustrated. It was also fascinating to read multiple characters perspective on why thirty-nine year old Alice is the way she is. The back cover of my copy says, ""Finally, a smart woman's beach read."" I think that's a great assessment. Alice is charming, likable and really funny at times like a good chick-lit heroine but this was not a fluffy story - it had some real meat to it...This book had me thinking about for days after I finished it. What would my self of ten years ago think of my self now - not knowing any of the things that have happened to me over the past ten years? I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun AND thoughtful summer read...*** As an aside - there is an infertility subplot that was handled really well. As someone who experienced three years of infertility before my first child was born, I'm extra sensitive to that sort of thing. It drives me crazy when books and movies have medically unrealistic infertility stories. The infertility story in this book was medically accurate and emotionally accurate as well. I could completely relate to the character that experiences infertility and I went through many of her emotions myself during my own struggles.",
Awesome,I am so happy that I read this book.  It is insightful and helps me to relate different periods of religious history.  I have gained so much from this book.,
Just What I Needed,"Great book, lavishly illustrated with lots of good info. Excellent reference to ID fish. Best buy from Wonderbooks & fast shipping.",
Ok book,I disliked that the product advertises a ton of stickers included yet most of the stickers are very tiny.,
Dark background and black lettering doesn't work,The words are almost illegible on the first few pages.. The dark background with black lettering is just awful and irresponsible. It should have been an easy fix for the publisher. Otherwise it's a cute book with a nice amount of pages and a sweet story. Just disappointed with the first impression of the first pages.,
Too much detail,"While the premise was interesting, the detail became overwhelming, suffocating the story. Each side story should have a point buttressing the main story or making you feel the story more -- Hill is not there yet. Needs a much heavier hand to edit it down.",
""" If you find it particularly easy to suspend your disbelief","Almost stopped several times... From a conversation with my wife while listening to this on a long drive: &#34;If he says 'countenance' one more time, we're throwing the disk out the window.&#34;  If you find it particularly easy to suspend your disbelief, like if you believe that members of congress who speak before hate groups really don't know where they are or who they are speaking to, then you may also be taken in by this novel.  We did finish it, by the way, and heaved a sigh of relief when it was finally over.  I think we are done with Dean.",
there she blows!,"In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick retells the true story of how a sperm whale rammed a whaleship in the early 1800’s and caused one of the most shocking disaster of that time. Unbeknownst to me, the popular story of Moby Dick, which I’m sure many of us have read or heard about during our early school years, was actually based on this story here. I blasted through this book over the weekend because it was just that good! You may not think there’s much to tell of a shipwreck but you’d be dead wrong. The survivors of the Essex whaleship disaster and what they had to endure is nothing short of pure torture of the highest degree and to even fathom how some of them made it out alive is a pure miracle of the highest order. The story has also been made into a movie of the same name starring Chris Hemsworth...“First I cry for his departure, then laugh because I’m free.” – Eliza Brock, Nantucket resident..Rather than dive straight into the disaster itself, the author gave a pretty detailed account of Nantucket, the island most famous during its time as the capital of whale oil harvesting from sperm whales. It’s obvious that killing and harvesting an animal for its product can be cruel. However, you should put all bias and opinions aside when reading stories such as this. We must never forget that these events took place almost two centuries ago. Things were a lot different then. The author retells this amazing story through the book and journal accounts of two survivors, first mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson. I found it amazing and oddly eerie that despite the dangers and circumstances they had to go through, the words they choose at certain times to describe the scene and emotions they were going through very poetic and calming...Hunting sperm whales for their oil was literally backbreaking work. Regardless of how one feels about the trade, you can’t deny that it takes a certain amount of courage. The hunters never had any high tech machinery to kill the whales. They relied on hand weapons such as harpoons and lances and that means the need to get up close and personal to the whale in the open sea in your little wooden boat. In addition, when a single voyage means almost being 2-3 years away from your family and friends, one must be physically and mentally fit to go through with it time and time again. In regards to the actual disaster itself and what the men had to go through to survive, you’ll just have to read it to believe it. It’s as simple as that...“We have been stove by a whale.” – Owen Chase..In the Heart of the Sea makes me appreciate non-fiction books that much more. When they are well written and told, it can beat any fantasy novel. I literally couldn’t put this book down because I just had to find out what happened next. Again, don’t be fooled into thinking that just because the men were stranded in the middle of the ocean that “nothing” of importance happens until they were rescued. If you have a goal of reading just one non-fiction book for the year, definitely make it this one. But like the author mentions at the end, just don’t label this an adventure story. It’s a disaster that just happens to be one of the greatest true stories ever told.",
"Cute, but too short",Only 4 pages.,
Comprehensive History of the Game,Very well written comprehensive history of this wonderful game.  It is not an instruction book.  I enjoyed it very much.,
"A little of the good, the bad and the ugly","In some ways it is 5-star, in others it is 1-star -- thus the 3 stars. I cannot lie. I found this book difficult to read due to the author's style and odd grammar, but I do find it to be a worthwhile book because it says things that NEED to be said and are not said enough...SOME PROS: This book -- as maddening as it was to read -- caused me to look at my own very different life experience in relation to Jesus in a new way that causes me to think it was not so different from Ms. Tower's after all. I also liked the way she put a good emphasis on treating one another with love and how important that is. This book gave me a whole new appreciation for pastors. I never really realized just how much one person in their church could put them through (sorry Ally, but you leaned on them a LOT...!!!). At the same time, I hope that pastors are the main people who read this book -- because it might help them realize how shunning is truly ineffective. I don't blame the pastors for Ally's problems, but she did trust those pastors like they were family and it was not until they learned to treat her with more acceptance and love that they could all really work to pray together in a way that was good for everyone involved. Her story highlights how easily the clergy can be their own worst enemy when they fear a person having problems rather than trusting God...SOME CONS: Poor editing of this book made it sometimes difficult for me to read. It would have been good for the editor to sit with the author and have her clarify the many sentences she wrote that truly made no sense without having to ""figure it out"" before continuing. I found this to be exasperating at times, but I really wanted to hear her story and plowed through. I often felt she was taking me in never-ending circles as she kept reverting back to where she started over and over. That is, she would reach out to the church, but then get involved more with Wicca. I think what bothered me the most was that although she elaborated (probably too much) on her conversations with different pastors and deacons and their wives regarding her spiritual struggle, she made not one allusion that I can remember to having told the Wiccans she was going to church. I wanted to know more about them and she seemed to protect them from exposure while elucidating about details of the rituals perhaps to prove that it was not ""satanic.""..BUT I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HER -- ANOTHER PRO: My mind kept judging her as I read the book, ""How can she do that? Why is she so wishy-washy?"" when she would reach out to the pastors of her church, have an awakening and feel touched by the Lord Jesus, and then go back into doing a full-out Wiccan ritual. I as stunned as I realized how like her I have been in my own life, (only without a relationship with the church and pastors), and how I strayed from true Christianity for 30 years -- following a guru while also calling myself a Christian and blithely thinking and feeling there was nothing at all wrong with that...!!!  Wow wow wow. I was just like her -- only in a different setting!..MORE CONS: It bothers me -- a LOT -- that she quoted so very few Bible passages in this book. People should be told that the Lord makes it clear that sorcery and witchcraft are an abomination in His eyes. I also wonder why in the world the pastors did not quote that passage to her (or if they did, why she chose not to mention it). Which leads me to another important point: the very few Bible quotes she gave were not from the real Bible but from paraphrasing ""bibles."" I realize that most Christians have NO CLUE that the 200-some ""new translations"" of the Bible are NOT the same Bible that Christians have given their lives to preserve for so many centuries. (Please check out YouTube videos with Gail Riplinger, David W. Daniels and others for more information if you don't want to buy their books on the topic. We are talking about the Word of God here. It is IMPORTANT...!!!!)..Last but not least, the author makes it TOTALLY clear that she was never a satanist and rarely thought she was doing anything ""bad"" in Wicca. She spends way too much time defending herself and defending Wicca and for me the cliffhanger of the book was to find out whether she would EVER see and admit that Wicca ultimately IS a tool of the devil. (And the answer is, well, yes and no. She kinda sorta admits it without making it too plain -- apparently because she feels it is too offensive to think of it that way?)..It was an exhausting book to read, but I am glad I read it. Actually, I have 10 pages to go before completely finishing the book but have already speed-read through to the end. Some books you wish would never end; this book is one I am very glad ended. I wish the author well and I am glad she is sharing her story -- yet I also feels she would or will be able to write a MUCH superior book once she gets her life and head straightened out a while longer (and starts also learning to read the REAL Bible...!)..Last but not least, the author does not seem to understand (or admit) that there really ARE a lot of different types of witches -- and probably also a lot of different types of Wiccans. I found her defense of Wicca to be incessant even though she finally let go of it in the end. I can understand now the reviewer who said s/he got the impression that the author may not have really let go all the way yet...I might question the veracity of the author were it not for the fact she has come out with a second book, FROM THE CRAFT TO CHRIST. I purchased both of them at the same time, and have a feeling I am going to enjoy it very much as it includes the stories of eight other former witches who have come to -- or come back to -- serving our Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you, S. A. Tower. I hope I have not offended you with my blunt review. I recommend the book!",

"Once again, captivating.","I could not have thought of a better ending to a trilogy than this! I look forward to other fantasies he plans on publishing. I really hated to finish this trilogy only because I was in love with the characters and did not want their stories to end. Sowe, Lia, Pasqua, the Aldermaston of Tintern Abbey, and of course, charming Edmon and Colvin. I really could not put down these books or let them out of my sight for a moment. My husband and I read them aloud to one another. We found ourselves wishing we could cancel dates with our friends to have more time in them.",
Well Written Fictional Portrayal of Early 20th Century Kidnapping,"Andrew Hilleman's &#34;World, Chase Me Down&#34; is an extremely well-written novel, based on the real-life kidnapping of the 16-year old son of a wealthy Omaha meat-packing magnate in 1900 by Pat Crowe and his criminal partner Billy Cavenaugh.  It's told from Crowe's perspective and largely in the form of flashbacks to the period surrounding the crime and the trial five years later, as well as a few glimpses into Crowe's later days (circa 70 years old).  Hilleman is an evocative writer and does an excellent job portraying early 20th century Omaha, Nebraska and Crowe's life on the lam...Pat Crowe--aside from one or two incidents--is a fairly likable criminal and it's the flashbacks to 1900 that are the highlights of this novel.  The trial bogs down a bit and is less entertaining than the rest of the book, but overall, this is an enjoyable and entertaining read, and an interesting fictionalized portrait of an early 20th Century crime and Omaha.",
Sandford never disappoints!  Love the book!,Interesting story line.  Exciting gun fights and Virgil Flowers.  All great books even when I am reading them out of order.,
Shirley Temple.,The writing is very small in this book. Good book otherwise.,
The Just Bentgo Cookbook,This is a fabulous book for some healthy lunch recipes and snacks for both children and adults. I am very pleased with all the Bentgo products and highly recommend any of there items!,
Great for beginners wanting to learn techniques,"I like how he breaks down the technique for each recipe. It makes it easy for beginners to really narrow down on what he calls, and I agree with, culinary intuition. Probably the best way I have heard it described personally.",
Not my cup of tea,"Slow moving and quite dull.  Sophie was not likable, but a spoiled brat.  This book disappointed me.  I trudged through it but not enjoying it.",
Every youth pastor and Christian parent should read this,Visit Ken Ham's website for more great info.  Creation Research.  It is so great to be able to quickly find and order just the book you need online.  Affordable pricing.  Thanks.,

"Books we love, box not so much.",Books are great and in alright condition. Can’t say so much for the collection box. It was ripped on one side and every corner was damaged. Looks like someone rolled it down the lighthouse stairs. Otherwise fine. Next time don’t store it on a soccer field,
Five Stars,Was a gift for my Mother and she loves it!,
Entertaining!,This book is written and illustrated very creatively and children will learn and be captured with the illustrations and examples in the story.,
Very enjoyable,I have to admit  I really enjoyed this book. It has just a tiny sprinkling of love and magic and mayhem. Too much and I doubt I would have read it. I loved the characters though and the setting on the Scottish coast.,
Birthday Gift,Bought as a gift for husband.  He told me he truly enjoyed it.  We both LOVE the character Jack Reacher. He likes this genre. The book arrived really quick.  Amazon has amazing prices for books.,
its must own,the thing i liked about this book is it gives you good back ground info on each ninja and each samurai in the book so if you looking to make a story about ninja or samurai this is a good reforance book to use.,
Excellent Rom-Com Book!,"This book was so good and went so much deeper than I expected. Leah is such an amazing character and I really felt her struggles and emotions throughout the novel. Eli was such a sweetheart, misguided at times, but still sweet. I adored the friend group that surrounded Eli (and then Leah) and how authentic their interactions were. Even though this is a romance, Leah and Eli both have growth throughout the story and this book also highlights the foster care system and foster kids. It balances the deeper moments well where they don't feel too heavy but you know they still matter. This was mostly closed door romance (nothing graphic beyond making out) so 1/5 for spice. Really recommend checking this out for a deeper-connecting romance...I also hope to get more stories from this town and friend group in the future!",
Cute book for anyone getting older,I bought this as a retirement gift for a very special person.  I thought it was witty and fun and he seemed to enjoy it as well.  I wanted something a little different than the standard joke gifts for retirement and this was perfect.  I would buy it again!,
Five Stars,love it,
One Star,Silly and poorly printed.  Not helpful in the last.,
Absolutely Breathtaking History!!!,"My regret with this blog tour and novel? I didn't read books 1-3. My praise for this novel? EVERYTHING! WOW! Barbara Kyle is highly talented and INSTANTLY transported me to the Tudor Era from page one and kept me there, among the Kings, Queens, and the newly evolving England. Absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED the pages of this novel...This is a different style of Tudor Era. Not so much in it has really changed, but the way England is evolving, with honoring more than the Catholics, and a new Queen, it's definitely a new outlook on life, during this amazing time period...Queen Elizabeth I. A wonderfully created character that fit her role perfectly. She is tested greatly when the French troops threaten to invade England. Taking a hostage, well, that was a twist I never expected from the newly reigning Queen. I just don't think of a Queen doing those things, but it truly added an engaging and intriguing twist to the story...What's more, and perhaps, my favorite part of the story, is Isabel and her husband Carlos. Circumstances become severe for them when he's forced to join troops. OPPOSITE his wife. A true test of love and loyalty, if ever there was one...I want to go into so much more detail. There are so many things I want to say about this beautifully written, awe inspiring, richly detailed novel, but I fear I will giveaway too much. I want you all to grab a copy of this FANTABULOUS, beyond 5 Book worthy novel, and open the pages. See for yourself that transformation that takes place as you loose yourself among the pages of this AWESOMETASTIC novel...Myself? Well, I'll be opening the pages of the first three Thornleigh novels to catch up with the story. While I wasn't overly confused by this novel and it's easily read as a stand alone, I would love to go back and see what this amazing author created before this...*This review is based on a complimentary copy which was provided for an honest review*",
Thought provoking insights,"Be forewarned: This book may be short in terms of pages but it's tough in terms of reading...While Kuhn has many insights, they come painfully and piece by piece...For those inclined to avoid the beanfields, here's my Cliff's Notes version:..Science is flawed like any other human endeavor. It's characterized by the creation of paradigms which exist when someone comes up with a great way of explaining something. When flaws appear in that first discoverer's fascade, the collective impulse on the part of the scientific community is to either ignore or minimalize the importance of the new evidence until enough scientists die off that the new generation can really appreciate the power of the new ideas in their own right. When this later process occurs science undergoes what's refered to as a ""paradigm shift.""..A collection of all science's paradigm shifts will take us...well, no one really knows until it happens...If your interest is picqued by this review, by all means read the book because Kuhn...albeitly abtusely and with little artistry...does manage to make his points. And they're good points too...all the more so because Kuhn actually came up with this stuff on his own...For more accessible works dealing with these same topics read either Sagan's Science as a Candle in the Dark or even Science Friction by Michael Shermer.",
Fanciful and Fabulous!,Silly and wonderful rhyming book about Mrs. McNosh...who winds up hanging all kinds of fanciful things on her wash line.  The rhymes are fabulous and children giggle away as it is read.  Perfect for 5 year olds...but two year olds would love the silliness as well.  and the rhymes are wonderful when you read to a baby as well which would keep the baby's attention since the colors in the illustrations are so captivating.  I put this book at a baby shower...along with a clothesline where guests could hang paper &#34;onesies&#34; on with wishes for the baby.  big hit!,
Book in very poor condition,"Book i bad condition. It has obviously gotten wet and all the pages were wrinkled and I don't even want to touch it, its gross.",
Too Much Author,"Purchased used on eBay and attempted to read. The story of Virginia Hill is worthy of a great biography. This is not it. There is too much ""badass"" attitude from the author, lots of f-bombs, and side comments supported with hashtags. I suppose this is meant to recruit younger readers -- is it YA? would you want a 13-y-o to read it? -- but it's a shame that the author didn't just stick to telling Hill's amazing story. My guess is you'll either like this treatment, if it's your thing, or you'll find it a big turn off as I did.",
Five Stars,Thx gift was perfect,
I loved the book,"The book is great and stands on its own.  But I'm glad I read ""Arthur Truluv"" first.  I have read many of Elizabeth Berg's books and have liked all of them.  I like her style of writing and her characters are so real.",
Beautifully written true story,"I loved this book. It is a lovely story of faith, love, and courage during WWII in Germany. We tend to forget the fact that not all Germans approved of Hitler, most were appalled, but lived in fear of the SS. I have read many books about this time in history and found this book well written with a unique perspective. It was only after I finished it that I realized it was a true story......highly recommend!",
INSIGHT ON AN IMPORTANT TOPIC,"I am a big fan of Robert Greene's other books, &#34;the 48 laws of power,&#34; &#34;Seduction,&#34; &#34;War,&#34; but while &#34;Mastery&#34; was a good book, I think it fell short of his other works.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very good book worth reading because you will gain some insight here.  I just felt it became a bit repetitive at times.  Maybe he was being repetitive to reinforce the fact that attaining mastery requires repetition?..I love the layout of the book because it is small chapters on a topic with dozens of notes and stories in the borders of the page.  It works out great for me because I would read a page or two, put it down and come back to it later, which gave me time to let each idea or thought sink in and gave me time to analyze them thoroughly.  I normally go through a book in a day or two, this one took me almost 3 months to read fully. But I think I got a lot more out of it that way...The author breaks up mastery into a few stages, apprenticeship, a creative-active level, and then mastery.  He further breaks down each level in strategies and modes.  Mastery will not come easily, it takes self discipline and perseverance, but it is achievable.  He also talks about something more important, making sure you are trying to gain mastery in the correct area or field.  Life could suck if you gain mastery and then realize it is something you hate to do.  Pick the right area...This book can help at many levels.  There is mastery of a career or maybe just mastery of a hobby or sport.  I used a number of the things I have learned in this book and others and applied it to a hobby of mine, competitive shooting.  I shot for many years achieving a level of just being average.  Then I found an acquaintance at a party who talked about competitive shooting.  He invited me to go shoot with him one day.  I realized that while I was learning at my own trial and error pace it could take me decades to get to his level on my own, or I could see this person as a mentor and knock years off my learning curve.  Since I started training with my friend I have already won two matches in my classification.  I have improved on every level imaginable in this sport and the more I learn, the more I realize there is to learn.  But getting back to the book, I am focusing on some thoughts the author laid out about mastering the basics through effort and practice before trying to move up a level with incomplete or inferior skills.  While I have yet to gain what I consider mastery in this sport, I know for a fact that I am well on my way and will achieve it quicker than if I did not follow the guidance of this book.",
I think she's going to enjoy all of them,"This the third of three cookbooks ordered for my granddaughter, I think she's going to enjoy all of them, but this one, in true Better Homes and Gardens fashion, has learning objectives. It teaches about measuring and what the different kitchen items are for and how they're used. Since she loves to help out in the kitchen, this will be so handy for her.",
A New Category,It seems to me that there are two imposters here.  The first is the person who wrote the book who then claimed it was written by Lee Child.  It is difficult for me to believe that it was actually written by Lee Child.  The second is the character in the book who claims to be Jack Reacher.  Really?  Trying to believe that is like trying to accept Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in the movie versions of these stories.  I've read all of the previous Jack Reacher novels.  This one should be in a new category:  Jack Reacher novels written by Lee Child's ghostwriter.,
Gorgeous images,Gorgeous images and nice paper.,
The Slayer Chronicles: First Kill or Why Heather Brewer ROCKS!,"I'm a huge Vlad fan! I totally LOVED all of Heather Brewer's The Chronicles of Vladimir Tod books! It was super sad to read the last in the series...But, as usual, Heather Brewer doesn't disappoint her minions!..In The Slayer Chronicles, she tells the story from Joss McMillian & the Slayers' point of view...It doesn't just work--it ROCKS!..So many times while reading First Kill I was like, ""Oh, oh, I know...this is xyz from Vlad! Awesome!"" And it was awesome! And the coolest thing is that you could start with Vlad or Joss and be equally as hooked! Have I mentioned how freaking cool this is? I mean, really, it is total author genius here! For real life!..OK, but what's the big deal? Well, Joss is a regular kid who is about to go hang out with his awesome cousin for the summer. Then his sister gets killed. In the middle of the night. By a vampire! At the funeral, his creepy uncle tells him to swear that he'll avenge her death. He swears. Fast forward a few years and we learn that, understandably, Joss and his parents have never recovered from the loss. Joss is ignored by his parents, who have just been coasting on auto-pilot since his sister's murder. So when that creepy Uncle Abraham asks for Joss to spend the summer with him doing wilderness survival training, the whole McMillan family goes for it. It is in the mountains that he learns the truth behind the Slayer Society and begins his crazy & often cruel training. Through Joss, we learn the flip side. Not as  much vampires are so awesome, but more of a awww, poor Slayers kind of sympathy. But the way that Joss looks at the world with compassion, empathy, and hatred totally works. Come on, how many people can pull that off?..Bottom line: If you loved Vlad, you'll love First Kill. If you haven't met Vlad yet, then you can start with either series (but if you are impatient like me, go for Vlad first because that series has more books!).[[ASIN:0803737416 First Kill (The Slayer Chronicles)]]",
One of the best books I have read in a long time,One of the best books I have read in a long time. This book really illustrated the hardships and resilience of people during the 2nd world war. I could not put this book down. Highly recommend!,
Family favorite!,This is our new family favorite!  Our 3 year old rarely sits still for a whole book and now he can’t get enough of this one!  He loves the pout pout fish’s saying and every time he says it with me with such excitement.  He asks me to read it daily.,
Too many questions,"I agree with most of the reviewers; this was a book that presented more questions than answers.  One question that I don't remember seeing was how could Tobias be a GD and Divergent when he also was resistant to the serum and had to be injected with the Divergent serum.  Michael, the lab tech said that Tobias showed a talent for resisting the simulations but that was all and it was an anomaly gene that allowed Tobias to appear to be Divergent.  Well, if he could resist simulations and serums and all the other cool stuff that Tris could do...(if it looks and talks like a duck)...I didn't get how Peter loved being evil but at the end wanted to erase his memory so he could forget all the evil stuff he did...And why was the ""secret"" so powerful it would change everything...but didn't change a thing when it was revealed?..Finally, I failed to comprehend why dividing people into factions would make them undamaged. The peace at all cost (Amity)faction wouldn't have survived a generation unless they could isolate themselves.  The selfless (Abnigation) faction would have little or no factionless people and all the starving factionless would run to that corner of the city making it impossible to sustain.  The nerds (Erudite)would shut themselves off and never have interbreed to create pure genes.  The tell it like it is (Candor) faction would hate each other by the end of the first year.  And the tattoo daredevils (Dauntless)would try to take over the other 4 factions.  There would be no way these factions could live together in a city and no way to keep one faction from taking over the weaker ones. None would heal, much less produce GP people.",
Shades of Magic,"Edgar is a typical young adult, he has no idea what he wants to do with his life however, he knows he doesn't want to be a farmer.  When he has the opportunity to travel with his uncle, and master magician Magnus, he jumps at the opportunity.  Adelaide is apprenticed to an herbalist in a world where women are not allowed to use magic.  Half-way through the story, the reader discovers that magic is fading.  In order to fix magic, Edgar, Magnus, Adelaide and Hesita, the herbalist, travel on a journey to recover a vitality shard.  Half of the book past before the plot line actually started.  Once the characters discovered that magic was failing, they undertook an extremely simple journey to solve the problem.  The  dangers and encounters of the journey were extremely simplistic and very easy to overcome.  Overall, I thought this book was a bust.",
Travel planner book,That’s good idea for travel planner almost alike bucket lists,
Great Read!,One of my favorite books of all times!!,
Good book,Good book with great pictures in it.  Only thing keeping it from 5 stars would be more pictures of what the rocks look like in a more natural state if you were in the field looking for them.,
Disappointing,Sorry but I was disappointed with this cookbook.  I purchased it as a gift and returned it for a refund.,
Perfect reproduction of the original used in  monasteries!,"Purchased for a friend who was a monk and he loved it. High Quality Breviary! It is a compact size intended to fit in an oversized pocket like the monks used and built to last with a leather cover, sewn binding and easy to read clear type font. Very happy with the quality and fair price for this breviary.",
I received an advanced copy and it was even better than the first,"I received an advanced copy and it was even better than the first. It was well plotted out with twists that I didn't see coming.  The characters kept me invested in the story the entire time. They were very believable as teenagers and adults nothing too cliche. Jason loses so much along the way in this book I found myself wondering when he would reach his breaking point. How much can one teenager take of being alone, virtually friendless, and everyone thinking you're a juvenile delinquent. Recurring nightmares, ghosts, paranormal gifts and The Headless Horseman spun between the pages. I can't wait for the next leg of the journey to begin.",
HOPE THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL .,"A very good read. Disappointed that some of the issues, presented in the story, were unresolved when.the story ended. Hope there will be a sequel.",
An overly long very good book,A very good book that ran about 50-75 pages too long.,
"Valuable for teachers, parents and anyone concerned about education","Despite its somewhat silly title, The Queen of Education by LouAnne Johnson is a no-nonsense, hard look at education in the United States, what is wrong with it, and how to fix it. While much of what Ms. Johnson says in not new, she says it based on her first hand experiences as a teacher and the book combines specific examples with general advice. Among the important points that Ms. Johnson makes is that kids are often labelled and see themselves in negative terms as a result. Teachers need to understand their students and treat them with respect...The book is written in a manner that lay persons can understand rather than in the  technological babble that is too often the case for education books. If your child is having problems in school this book may well help.",
High quality,It's absolutely beautiful.,
Wow! Brilliantly weaved story!,"I read A LOT. I am usually very good at peicing together the ""who done it"" well before the reveal.  The brilliant way the author brought the story together from the various points of view never gave up too much too soon.  I felt immersed in the lives of the various characters..I am a bereaved mom, myself, and saw the torment that the missing girl's mom suffered as very real and descriptive...I am either going to have to talk my husband into reading with Kindle or buy him the hardcopy of this story. It will be one that he will enjoy, too!..Excellent story!",

An Essential How-To Guide for ALL interested in Family History Research,"Barry is amazing. I first became acquainted with his vast expertise at a random family history conference I decided to attend one Satruday in Salt Lake City, UT.  The one hour I spent listening to Barry's instruction on how to collect/record oral interviews was one of the most worthwhile hours I ever spent.  Therefore, I was very motivated to learn anything else I could from him.  I have anxiously awaited the publishing of this book, and have followed Barry on Facebook as well. I started towards the end of the book (chapter 11) because lately I have been engaged in collecting, transcribing, and disseminating written family history articles (letters, journals, and other documents), and I was not disappointed. Barry systematically lays an outline and provides interesting and applicable methods for accomplishing suggested family history tasks.  His work is thorough - and therefore thought-provoking and inspiring.  I have been doing family history work for 15 years and am very organized; Therefore, I was reassured that much of what I have done is in fact very efficient.  But, Barry's insight and experiences and suggestions on how to approach other family members to obtain information was specifically invaluable for me....because it is an area I have failed in time and time again and really didn't know how to proceed.  I now feel like I have a whole ""tool kit"" to approach this aspect of family history work, and look forward to giving it another try.  His personal experiences are substantial and applicable to global family circumstances I (and undoubtedly many) will face when doing family history research.  I wouldn't be without this book to refer to over and over again. Family history enthusiasts at all levels will find a treasure trove of helpful information and ""how-to's"" within.",

Pearls from a master journalist,"The title of this selection of articles by the late Daniel Pearl has been taken from a theater essay by the playwright Arthur Miller entitled ""The Family in Modern Drama."" Miller describes the role of a family's breadwinner, whom he envisions as a traditional paterfamilias, as making the world just as familiar and comfortable a home as his immediate family environment. Dan Pearl succeeded notably in that enterprise, writing with professional detachment, objectivity, elegance, humor, and a tincture of scholarship about the ironies of the human condition in far-flung, exotic places - India, where cows may be sacred but leather goods are manufactured; Iran, whose youths may publicly spout anti-American slogans but scheme to obtain in, say, Turkey, a U.S. visa ""to study, perchance to stay"" - an allusion to Hamlet's ""to sleep, perchance to dream""; even Kosovo, where ""genocide"" turned out to be ""small acts of intimate barbarity."" Throughout his educative articles, which he honed until he heard the sentences ""sing,"" Dan Pearl exhibits the total lack of malice, the calm and perceptive gaze, and the disinclination to histrionics for which his father justly praises him in a prefatory eulogy. The articles fit perfectly what the book's jacket calls the Journal's ""iconic middle column,"" and together they constitute a lasting tribute to their late author.",
I love the Infinite City series 💖💖💖,"This is the second time I've read Entwined Fates, the first being in the Pets in Space anthology I love it the and I love it even more the second time around.  Volcair & Kiara's story is beautiful from start to finish. Some how the authors take a short story and deliver a full tale with well throughout characters that you can't help but root for and love! And a storyline that reaches deep into your heart and pulls every emotional strong you have.  You can feel the connection between the H & h it's powerful, it feels genuine never  forced and the relationship beautifully unfolds to something soul deep and wonderful!.this series is by far one of my very favorites and I look forward to Tiffany Roberts creating more memorable characters,experiences and passionate love stories from the Infinite City series.💖I highly recommend you read this fabulous story!",💖💖💖💖
Loved it!,Several books have recently come out about WWI -- it's the 100th Anniversary.  This one is a lovely story.  Just right battle front descriptions.  Spunky female main character.  The most tender and innocent love scene I've ever read.  Very nice change from books I might normally read -- legal thrillers.  Guess you'd say I really enjoyed this book.,

Loved it!,"What a fantastic book!  I have never followed Andre Agassi, or tennis for that matter, but heard this book got wonderful reviews so I thought I'd check it out.  I had no idea how engaging this incredible book would be.  I could not put it down!  It is an extremely well written (no typos I might add), completely engaging, and openly honest account of Mr. Agassi's life.  This is not just another celebrity autobiography written for monetary gains.  It is the emotionally poignant tale of one man's trials and tribulations spanning from childhood to manhood.  This is not a story of fame; it is a story of forgiveness, learning from the past, discovering one's self, and moving forward in life.  If you want to read about an OPEN celebrity who is not afraid of being real and raw, READ THIS.  I cannot recommend this book enough - it is a must read.",

Good Read,"**I received an ARC of this story in exchange for an honest review**.Michelle is stuck in Temptation, LA, trying to get her grandmother to leave with her as a hurricane is approaching. When she finally gives up, Sheriff Gator Landry shows up in his boat with another attempt at evacuation. Instead, they are all trapped in the house when the hurricane hits. This give both Gator and Michelle time to recall all the feelings they shared 16yrs earlier when Michelle spent a summer with her grandparents. As Michelle stays around for cleanup afterwards, they start to experience the same feelings as before..Michelle, not given the best example of a family, has done well at succeeding at a job she's always wanted and living a life she's happy with. She definitely cares for her grandma and is willing to do what she can for her. Gator is a fairly typical male. He was given a huge responsibility he didn't want, but in the end, he decided to step up to the plate. Having been hurt years before by Michelle, he was afraid to get close to her again..Overall, I really liked this book. The back story of a hurricane and the aftermath are a different plot setting for me and gave me a setting to read about. The only complaint I would have is probably that it was 16yrs and the feelings were just as strong. Given how long it was, that was a little hard for me to buy (7-8yrs would've been better). I would recommend this book to anyone that likes easy, fairly lighthearted romances.",
Waste of money and time,"I thought this book was about ideas in incorporating &#34;thermal&#34; aspects into architecture, that it might provide some ideas or include some pictures.

Not for everyone...,"I first want to say that I read this book from beginning to end. I often lose interest in books, even the good ones, so for it to keep my attention was feat in itself. However, I am ambivalent about this book. It kept me reading, mainly due to the technical craft of the writer, more so than to the building of plot or an investment in any of the characters. The main character seemed to show little growth or development as he aged and although I should have had more empathy for him, it was lacking. Theo's narrative style changes little from an adolescent into adulthood, considering the story is supposedly told from the notebooks he kept throughout his life. Due to the character's lack of maturity, by the end I had little compassion for his fate. Was this the writer's intention? Some implausible plot points also added to a lack of my full investment in discovering where things were headed. I've intentionally avoided spoilers, but the one thing I must say is that if you are waiting for things to wrap up nicely, or with any sense of optimism, you will be left unfulfilled. Oddly enough, the final chapter was probably my favorite part of the novel. It was so well written and the philosophical points resonated. Thankfully, it was a deserved little treasure presented at the end of a somewhat arduous 771 page journey.",
"Poetry, History, Vocabulary All in One Volume",What a wonderful book!  I love that words are defined that may be difficult for children to understand and that the poems are explained in the back of the book for young readers who do not know what farms are like or how telephone calls were first made in this country...The art is beautiful.  I just wish more care had been taken with the fonts and colors because some of the poems are hard to read against the art background...I think they make wonderful gifts for second graders and older.,

Excellent Reading,"As a history buff, a mystery lover and a believer in good writing in all fields ,  I give kudos to Mr. Miller.  From the establishment of the premise to the indisputable  conclusion, the plot is tight and moves along at a smooth pace.  Characters are well drawn and avoid caricature. Even minor actors have details about them to make them well rounded. The historical urban geography is well enough mapped it has a presence of its own; the overlay of 1861 Washington feels familiar and walkable. Good work, Mr Miller.",

The story  switches in time, place and characters. I actually think the histories of the different time frames may have been my favorite parts because it was so hard to keep the rest in my head and even after it was finished I still couldn't keep it straight.

Self-published teenager veiw of nocturnally jumbled perceptions of naughtiness,"I know I promised in my AYA that I was no longer taking the time or effort to work on reviews that I would give less than three stars to; but, being an aficionado of drug-related books, I have to post this review as a warning...This self-published book is a nightmare of teenage nocturnal hormones and a total lack of understanding of the drug culture.  Author Gerald Luc gushes about this 100 page short as ""having a soundtrack"" because he often mentions particular songs in conjunction with particular scenes.  He also had the audacity to add (supposedly truthful) ""descriptions"" of counter-culture cliques such as hippies, punks, and beatniks; an insult to those of us who actually were alive during these cultural revolutions and took place in them...The drugs?  No one shoots up, a couple of pills are popped, and a little MJ smoking is achieved.  There are no trips and one very lame withdrawal described more like a tequila hangover.  If it's true that you should ""write what you know"", this kid strayed far from that advice.  It's true the prose shows some promising future skill at writing, but the author needs to work on the emotional aspect of his flat and careless characterizations...So what is the book about?  A young man wants to write a book, has a great deal of carnal relationships with several girls, spends a weekend in New York where another teenage carnal fantasy is filled by having a hooker show up at his hotel room.  There isn't much to the book except bland rutting and pipe dreams of youth.  Boring.  Thank goodness it was only 100 pages, unfortunately filled with wet-dream fantasy, no drugs other than the action of 'placing a white pill in her mouth', and cheesy advertisements for the author's ""listening list"".  Avoid this book.",
Great read,Very interesting. Highly recomended,
Love this book,It is such a cute book. The pictures are great and fun to color. I am so glad I purchased this item.,
Crystal Blue Persuasion,"WOW Just as promised...used and seems new. Best book vendor ever..Can not get over how quick delivery was..Thank you, thank you..Love this book which took me back to simpler times in late '60s Hawaii and being an early teen..Innocent, reckless times. Bittersweet, as I lived it too.",
"2.5 stars from me: I learned from it, but I was also irritated by it and the tone","The book did motivate me to learn more and reduce waste. However, I think the author is not part of an everyday family with average means and access, and I suspect she doesn't work a typical job in terms of core working hours and flexibility. Yet I think she wrote her book for typical families -- those with average monetary and schedule considerations. I was irked the tone of the book and what I perceived to be the sense that many scenarios families face are clear-cut, black and white choices between right and wrong, good and evil...Much of what she recommends requires you to have lots of spare time and resources. And most of us do not have access to much of what she recommends using/buying. I do realize that if you and your family dive 100% into this process the way she was able to, you will save money, and, therefore, might gather the means to be more flexible and be able to afford this lifestyle. But if you and your family cannot dive in 100%, this process will cost much more in terms of time, energy, resources, and money. I think her family supported her ambition without exception, and that makes the transition to and sustainment of this lifestyle much easier. In reality, though, I suspect that most families will support small aspects--but not most or all--of this lifestyle, so I think many families will wind up leading both lifestyles partway, which is maybe okay to do, but it will take more time, energy, and money to do it. She needs to address that and help the partway families or the families with reluctant members. A more modular approach in the book might have helped a wider cross section of families...She also seems to live in a binary world where a thing is either useful or useless, and it is that one thing to every member of the family unequivocally. What I find to be use/ful/less is subjective, and I'm not the only person living in my household. So her advice about things like decorating is useless and often irritating. Lastly, I can't relate to lots of the recommendations, such as using turkey lacers for toothpicks and getting laser surgery instead of using reading glasses...If the book had approached the transition more incrementally, if it had been framed differently, and if it addressed the typical family in our society, I think I'd recommend it. As is, I think you can learn more from the internet and by reading various facebook groups that support reduction and reuse. I got the book in paper format because I wanted to read it, learn from it, and then share it without the restrictions that kindle-sharing imposes. Mission partially accomplished since I did learn some things from it, but it irked me as much as helped me, and I can't recommend it without reservation.",

Styrofoam Throne could be my diary!,"Takes me back to my childhood, where I too worked at a seaside haunted castle, the one in particular the was used as a basis for this story, so reading this book was a true treat for me. The only thing I can honestly say that I didn't like was that it was too short and could've had sequels. David Bone really brought me back, even had a dream of the Castle last night!",
Great gift,I received this as a gift from my brother and now in returning the favor. Many many many great recipes inside and I've used several of them.,
Great insights,"I had never heard of Bob Odenkirk before Breaking Bad. I have never been much of a sketch comedy fan, except for SNL. But his performance on BB and Better Call Saul has been so incredibly funny, heartbreaking, enchanting, that I am a huge fan. I could almost hear him talking as Saul when I read his words. He is a beautiful writer (no surprise, he’s been doing it his entire life). I didn’t find this to be a quick read, because there are so many names, and so much philosophy about comedy and comedy writing, that I didn’t want to miss a word. I can appreciate sketch comedy so much more now, after reading about the process and how difficult it is.",
Great stuff!,Great stuff from a really exciting writer!,
Loved this book!,"Sadly, I just finished the book. Left me wanting more! What a remarkable story of love, loss, classism, determination. All with sparkling humor sprinkled in for good measure. A real page turner!",

Beautiful story that grips your soul,"I haven’t been so moved about a book since Nightingale. Thankfully I read enough reviews to know that I shouldn’t be around anyone else at the end because it will make you cry...more like SOB! What an utterly beautiful story.

"Excellent insider info for ETHICAL realtors, and buyers and sellers.","Excellent and eye-opening! Seriously, a must-read for realtors/brokers AND anyone considering buying or selling.",
This is a must read!,"The story is moving, well written and an easy read. I didn't want to put it down. I am a dog lover and a volunteer for the Navy Marine Corps Relief Society. The book references organizations that support programs for service members as well as Service Dog program creation for Wounded Warriors legislation and their authors. I would want to support these programs with my volunteer time. If you have ever loved a wounded warrior, any dog or have an affinity for Golden Retrievers, this book is for you. I also feel that Luis's description of PTSD and it's devastating effects on one's life is spot on-regardless if your PTSD is combat related or not. So I would also urge all of those out there who are dealing with PTSD in any way shape or form to read this book. This book touched me deeply and raised my awareness immensely-something I appreciate as I am a civilian.[[ASIN:0976237008 Century of Service Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society,A]]",

Interesting Novel,"The story was intriguing and I wanted to find out what happened.  However, there was too much reflecting on the past between the dialogue. This made it difficult to follow the storyline.",
More then recipes,This book goes beyond the recipes and dives into the theory of sourdough and teaches you the underlying concepts. A must for anyone who really wants to understand what they are doing and why,
good book for basics.. but....,"this is a good book so don't get me wrong it just lacked some.. The author gives a clear outline of what Church is supposed to be, but then encourages people to stay in the system that lacks..So i do not give this any more than 3 stars.  He makes some very good points and thoughts so this book is not thrown out with the bathwater either....read it, but have your own opinion..",
Solid Victorian Stuff,"Gerard Freeman, the hero of the book at a very early age in Australia, growing up with his mother, realizes something is wrong with her and with him. He falls in love with a pen pal, who is going to undergo surgery and can become paralyzed. Such is the beginning...True to Victorian times, a large part of the book is spent in Gerard reading old manuscripts, nice short ghostly tales somehow never reaching the finesse that Ms. Byatt achieved in Possession. Perhaps Mr. Harwood did borrow, albeit unconciously from that book, perhaps not...It is so well written that time and pages fly quickly. Ultimately, everything is neatly tied in with a rather unbelievable climax. Still, a very tidy book. Good ghost stories are hard to come by and the last one was also from Australia, Richard Adams' (Watership Down) The Girl On The Swing.That was a real spine tingler. This one could have been a stunning novella, in the manner of The Turn of the Screw. Expanding it to a novel length has robbed it of much needed intensity. The author has promise and I look forward to his new book.",
Three Stars,The stories from at least two of the books make little sense.,
Thoughtfully designed,"Amazing book! My 6 year old daughter has been really struggling with learning to tie her shoes - and she was getting so frustrated and ready to give up completely and just wear velcro shoes the rest of her life. .. when I saw this book I thought maybe it could help and that it's a very simple way of teaching them step by step. I had no idea that the second day of having the book, and the first day of her actually sitting down with it--- she has tied it twice!!!!!!!! She's so proud of herself and very much encouraged to keep trying and that she can do it - it just takes practice! Even if you don't use the way the book shows to teach them to tie ( making two loops and tying them together ), the different colored laces help considerably with any way you show them! I would very much recommend picking one up! Absolutely exceeded all of our expectations! Thoughtfully designed, well made, great book!",
Another great,"I’m a cat lover so I really enjoy Meri’s part in the storys. I like the 2 storylines, with 1being carried over, I had expectations of them being connected but not the case. While Thorn seems like a sweet guy he really doesn’t seem to support or listen to his bride to be as well as he should. While I hate to think it I’m hoping he doesn’t have another attack of jealousy, I don’t feel he’s someone I could trust fully. Hope I’m wrong",

The photos and instructions are wonderful. I can't wait to make everything in this book. I have a collection of amazing French Pastry Books by French Pastry Chef's and this one is at the top of my list. I also highly recommend 'The Art of French Pastry&#34; by Jacquy Pfeiffer and &#34;The Bouchon Bakery&#34; by Thomas Keller. I love  baking and cooking from scratch and I have a number of other favorites for baking and treats (like Bravetart) but these are my favorite specifically for French Pastry..&#34;Tasting Paris&#34; is another beautiful cook book that gives a wonderful taste of France, both pastry as well as meals.",
The lack of horror makes no difference.,"I've said it before and I'll say it again:  even without using any supernatural elements in his stories, Stephen King is a brilliant author.  The strength of his storytelling is in his characters and the first three stories in this book make that very apparent..I've seen the movie SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION a couple of times, so I knew the ending.  Nevertheless, I found this novella to be engrossing.  The first person narration gives the story a personal feel, even if the narrator isn't who the story is really about.  Using this technique, the reader doesn't really get into the head of the main character, but that makes the story all the more intriguing since we don't know what he's planning or thinking or even what his true motivations are..APT PUPIL (I haven't seen this film) was scary because it was so realistic.  We see the characters going from a respectable student and a quiet old man to two people giving in to their base desires.  While one of them welcomes this as a return to things familiar, we see the other one struggle against them, knowing that they are wrong, but not being able to do anything about it.  This is a truly horrific story, but it contains none of King's usual supernatural elements..The third story, THE BODY, is the best in the book.  I've only seen the first twenty minutes or so of STAND BY ME (which is based on this story), so I didn't really know what to expect.  Some of King's best work comes when he is telling coming of age stories of teens or pre-teens.  IT and CHRISTINE were brilliant and I now have to put this story in that category.  No true horror here, just a story about four ordinary friends in middle America spending the last weekend of the summer together.  This is King's trademark brilliant character interaction and development.  The story itself isn't all that exciting, but watching these boys together makes the story a very enjoyable read..Finally, we have THE BREATHING METHOD.  While not as engrossing as the other stories, it does get back to King's supernatural twist at the end.  I enjoyed reading it, but it just didn't grab me the way the others in this book did.  I'm not sure I can really pinpoint why because the characters were just as developed..Anyway, if you're a King fan, you'll definitely enjoy these stories.  If you haven't read King before, don't read these expecting to be surrounded by the macabre.  These truly show off King's strengths as a storyteller by stripping away all the horror and supernatural elements.  He's probably one of the best writers in America today and these stories prove it.",
Before the Afterlife,Annie Graceland is an empathic who senses others emotions and sees dead people. Dr Derrick Fuller is murdered and comes to Annie for help in finding said person so he can move on to the Afterlife. I gave it 2 1/2 stars. A charming little book with a lot of humor!,
Grammatical Errors Make for Difficult Reading,"As soon as I got the book, I thought, &quot;Oh, it's so short. It'll be my bedtime read.&quot; Instead, I'm only on page 5 after trying to read it two nights in a row! There are so many grammatical errors, run-in sentences, and even nonsensical ones that I am spending so much time re-reading paragraphs to determine what is being said. Thinking I was being overcritical, I asked my husband to read a paragraph. He, too, did not know what to make of it...As short as the book is -- even though I'm only on page 5 -- I already know it should be even shorter. Many paragraphs were lengthened by reiterating prior sentences. Yikes!..Unfortunately, I cannot return the book since I began writing in it. Being an ESL individual myself, I thought if I just filled in the missing adjectives and verbs or re-write the paragraph altogether, I'd able to get the gist of the message. I'm struggling!",
A wonderful book for helping your young child,"Such a wonderful book! It comes at a time for our family when Grandma's health is declining. For our daughter who is nearly three, Grandma seems a bit scary, since she doesn't look and act quite like herself. When we visit Grandma, she tends to moan a bit, which is very frightening to our toddler...This beautiful story is about a boy named Bobby and his Grandfather, Bob, who lives with Bobby and his parents. They have a lovely relationship; they spend lots of time together, building with blocks and sharing stories. Bobby especially likes for Bob to tell him the story about how Bobby learned to walk... ''Now one foot, now the other.''..When Bobby is 5 years old, Bob has a stroke, and the little boy is frightened by the changes in his grandfather. Once Bob finally gets home from the hospital, he doesn't seem to recognize Bobby. The first sound Bob tries to make ''sounds like a monster'' to Bobby, but Bobby learns to understand Bob and, through love and persistence, is instrumental in Bob's recovery...I'm sure that this book will help my daughter to understand why Grandma isn't quite herself. Hopefully, our visits to see Grandma will be less stressful for her (and for me). After reading this story to my toddler at least dozen times (we received this book in the mail just three days ago), I can finally keep from tearing up until the very last page. I highly recommend this lovely book!",

My rating: 5/5,"*My review* [MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS]:..I am speechless after reading this. It’s because I whole heartedly love this book, which was also the reason why it left me completely entirely heart-brokened. I am not joking when I’m saying whilst reading the last few pages, I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and literally crying hysterically. I must admit I wouldn’t describe myself as emotionally stable right now. I don’t want to spoil the journey but I just want to say Tarryn Fisher is cruel. She is just damn cruel. This book was a straight 6-hour no sleep read for me, I couldn’t stop, even if I wanted to. Trust me I did, I wanted to stop before reaching the final chapter, what I fear would happen had happened. Even though I prepared for the worst, I still couldn’t take it when it finally hit me. I know you’re thinking I’m being dramatic, but no I’m not. Not after this book. Instantly writing this review straight after finishing the book didn’t give me an opportunity for my strong emotions to fade either. I’m trying to keep it fresh for you guys though!..Plot:..The plot was genuinely amazing. How the hell did anyone figure that out? I can’t imagine what’s going on in that mind of Tarryn Fisher’s. I’ve never read this kind of genre before, for me it wasn’t just a regular NA novel, but ‘dark’ definitely fits into the category. I may sound like a hypocrite, because I used to mention I loved fairytales and happy endings but I guess the reason I was drawn into this novel was that it was not fairytale material. It portrays the cynicism of people and society, and I would agree is an accurate depiction of the real world we live in. This is by far, one of my favourite group of characters ever. I love how all of them aren’t perfect, but deep down lost in their own waves of betrayal, denial and revenge. The story starts as Olivia regretting her mistake leading to a breakup with Caleb. She knows that Caleb hates her, and never wants to see her again. But what if you get a second chance? Can she start all over again, clean slate? That chance comes to her as Caleb has amnesia due to his accident and no longer remember hers. Opportunity comes and she grabs it. So in love with Caleb, she’s willing to do anything to get him back. These involving the ugly stuff, where tears get spilled, hearts get broken, and love gets lost in the lies, secrets and the dirty plots...Main Characters + actor/actress that I think would fit the role:..Olivia Kaspen – If you’re looking for the kind loving and pretty woman, Olivia’s not it. Well she is pretty, but underneath the pretty face is the eager selfish wolf ready to attack at any moment. Olivia is difficult to describe, she’s like ten girls into one. I would say that she is an emotionally wrecked character, trust isn’t her strong suit due to her past experiences, so she creates a barrier surrounding herself with her cold personality, and pushes anyone possible to coming close to her away, to keep a safe distance. Nevertheless she is someone who definitely gets what she wants and she will make sure it happens...Actress: Jillian Murray..Caleb Drake – You might think he’s perfect. The rich unquestionably handsome and charming man. Close, but not at all what it seems, he’s also a character who’s been through a lot. Because of his unconditional love for Olivia, he has been hurt by her again and again. But even though he’s been hurt countless of times, he still can’t live without her, because it would hurt more. He wanted her as part of his life, anyway possible. It would be unfair to blame it all on Olivia because he did make some s***ty mistakes too. Their relationship was like a ticking time bomb constantly ready for a spark to light the fuel...Actor: Henry Cavil..My favourite quotes from the book (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT)..“Because I am a Llama and you are a bird and WE are not compatible.” – Olivia..“I was a relationship retard. I kicked, shoved, and punched people out of my life, so they never had a chance to hurt me.” – Olivia..“I kiss him for all the times I never got to kiss him, and for the times he’s been kissing Leah instead of me. I kiss him because I ruined everything and I could have had this every day.” – Olivia..“A man is only as good as what he loves most right?” – Caleb..“I am so good at pretending, that sometimes I lose track of who I really am.” – Olivia..“I had hurt the person I loved the most, the only person I had – all to avenge myself. And in the end, I had destroyed myself.” – Olivia..“I think that after the first time you give your heart away, you never get it back. The rest of your life is just you pretending that you still have a heart.” – Noah..“I’m saying that you don’t love him as much as you love yourself.” – Noah..“There is more to loving someone than just making yourself happy. You have to want him to be happier than you are.” – Noah..“I love you too, Olivia. More than I could ever love another soul. There hasn’t been a single hour in seven years that I haven’t thought of you.” – Caleb..“It is the last real kiss of my life. I forever cling to that kiss. It was goodbye and I’m sorry and I love you so much.” – Olivia..“Caleb was like a hurricane that swept through my life, stirring up things inside of me that I never knew existed. He is a longing I will never cure.” – Olivia..“Life balances itself on a precarious ledge, we can stay safe up high or propel off the edge.” – Noah..“You can only give your heart away once; after that, everything else will chase your first love.” – Olivia",+
Good ideas but some Recipes don’t Work,Lots of Recipe Errors,
Five Stars,Excellent book,
It is very well written,My Husband is a Historian and likes the book.,
Jennifer Paterson Is A Goddess,"I recently acquired everything that the Two Fat Ladies have published. This book, ""Seasonal Receipts"" is among the best. Real food for real people, the recipes are accompanied by interesting stories salted with Jennifer's tremendous wit, and peppered with tales of her beloved saints. This is simply food that you want to eat. With some anthropology thrown into the mix, this book is delicious.",
Soderberg is not Jo Nesbo,"I was very disappointed in this mystery.  It was advertised as &#34;If you love Jo Nesbo, you must read Alexander Soderberg&#34;...so wrong, in my opinion.  Jo Nesbo is one of the most brilliant authors today with his Norwegian based mysteries.  Where as Soderberg is Swedish and the countries are close in proximity, that is where the comparison should end.  Totally unsatisfying read.",
Definitely Lacking Da Vinci Magic,I have read all 5 of Dan Brown's novels.  Here's how I would rank them:..#1 Da Vinci Code (great).#2 Digital Fortress (good).#3 Angels & Demons (average).#4 Lost Symbol (poor).#5 Deception Point (terrible)..My biggest problem with The Lost Symbol is that I completely guessed the anticlimatic ending a quarter of the way into the book.  The plot also requires supposedly intelligent characters to be unbelievably trusting and careless...There are a few interesting historical facts introduced throughout the book but certainly nothing close to those in Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons.,
This is not sci-fi.,"I finished reading poet's story and reading this book feels like pulling your teeth. So much technical jargon, that after a while you just go with it, without really visualizing what any of them mean...So in the beginning you are introduced to an interstellar war looming: The space barbarians, called ousters are preparing to destroy the world called Hyperion..""Space barbarians"" - this sounds just wrong on every level. As I think of a barbarian, I picture a bare chest man with a beard and a Viking helmet and two axes running at you screaming, not someone on a spaceship. What a mess! it just sets a wrong precedence early on in this book. Then the further you read the more it feels like this book is based on religion; there are Christianity themes, Islam themes and even Buddhism..So once again - how is this a sci-fi? 7 random characters are assembled for a pilgrimage that all travel on a tree-ship, which sounds like something out of a fantasy book, not a sci-fi, so how are we supposed to take this book seriously?..The characters are completely boring, lack of depth and failing to form any emotional connection with a reader. I swear thousands of these ""5-star"" readers must be some religious zealots or something...I read Expanse, Game of Thrones, Some of Neil Asher polity books, some from Alistair Reynolds, Adrian Tchaikovsky, The saga of seven suns, and while some were greater than others, my god all of them at any worst point in them are better than Hyperion. I will still finish this book, just to make sure there is nothing I am missing out there, but at this point I have lost any hope that this book will redeem itself. If it does, I will come back and update my review.",
Very inspiring!,"This book was inspiring to say the least. How many times do we hear stories of persecution and think of them as just that stories? Or just something that happened in the past? These real life stories are happening right now in different countries around the world. This book will inspire you to stand for your faith, and to pray for our Christian brothers and sisters around the world each and every day. So many times, we as Americans take our freedom of religion for granted. This book reminded me of the great freedom I have to not only go to church and worship without fear of being arrested, but just owning a Bible is a luxury in some of these countries, and can also be cause for being arrested. Don't take that freedom for granted! There are people who want to take that freedom away. I highly recommend this book. I love how it puts you right there like you are the one talking to these persecuted Christians. I love the encouragement at the end of each entry as well...**I received a copy of this book for review from Moody Publishers.

Nice book,Very nice book. The scenes are very spring.,
I love to color in my book ! Lots of pictures to choose from !,"I really enjoy coloring bit can never find a coloring book that I actually like and makes me want to sit down and color.  I came across this one and it instantly grabbed my attention.  When I received it, it was a bit smaller than I was expecting.  Not a problem at all though.  There are 48 different pics ranging from flowers to food to buildings.  Alot of detail so makes coloring very interesting and fun.  I love that the pages are easy to tear out. I was able to give my daughter one to color while I worked on another. She's 8 so she really enjoyed coloring her page.  The CD that comes with it is relaxing. It's not really classical but is instrumental.  I plan on ordering a book in each theme because these are really nice .  I highly recommend these adult coloring books .

Beautifully Written,"I absolutely loved this book.  The characters are so well developed, the plot is beautifully done, and while I couldn't put it down, I also didn't want it to end.  The author's descriptions put the reader right in the middle of the story, we feel like we too are living in the homes described and we are a mouse or a cat (Shadow) watching the events.  Thank you to the author, and please treat us with another.",
Grains,"I had hoped to find GRAINS more readable than I did. I had hoped to get a better understanding of why grain prices fluctuate, to help me in my own business. I sort of got that, but I probably missed a lot of the finer points and arguments the author made...This is a very academic book, backed with a lot of data references. My eyes glazed over more than once; the author’s style was dry and pedantic for me. I wouldn’t recommend this for the average layperson, unless you want to dive very deeply into how politics and economy affects the production of grains.",
A decent enough beach read,"This is a fairly interesting book, given the hoopla surrounding it. People have been comparing this to various books, especially Fifty Shades of Grey, due to the book containing a moderate amount of sex scenes. I need to say straight off that I'm not  a Fifty Shades fan, so when I picked this up I was more expecting to find something new to poke fun at...People picking this up hoping that it will contain as many sex scenes as FSoG will be disappointed. Yes, there is sex in the work, but it's nowhere near as prevalent as some of the professional reviews would have you believe. The book *is* liberally sprinkled with sex or references to it, but it's more of an afterthought than anything else and Hilton could have probably removed or reduced many of these scenes without harming the novel. Doing this probably would have worked out well for Hilton, as the critics were right about one thing. The sex scenes are easily the weakest part of the book. They're not awful, but they just feel a bit superfluous at times. It's not Laurell K Hamilton level, where her characters go &#34;OK! STOP - SEXY TIME&#34; (my apologies to MC Hammer) at ridiculous moments, so the book does have that going for it...The characters are OK enough for the most part, although the majority of them just sort of faded in and out of the book. I don't know that I could really name many of the characters outside of Judith and Rupert, as I forgot about many of them once they'd served their purpose in the book. Judith is relatively interesting, as she's far from a likable person but still has some occasional twinges of regret now and again...Maestra really takes off whenever Hilton starts writing about art and the forged paintings, as this is easily the most entertaining stuff in the book and I can't help but wish that there was more of this as opposed to the sex and murder. I like books that have unlikeable, yet compelling lead characters, but this just wasn't quite a four star read for me. It's certainly entertaining and would make for a good beach read, but I can't help but hope that Hilton manages to work out the kinks in part two of the series otherwise I'm not sure that the Maestra series has enough gusto to make a satisfying trilogy.",

Fantastic manga.,Very well done.,
Works if you adhere to directions,"This works if you follow it strictly, straying from the directions will lead to lesser results.  I was able to lose 10 pounds and maintain the loss however the 2nd time I tried it, I was not as strict and the results were less impressive.",
Laugh out loud scary,"I could not put this down - I was giggling and snorting like a madwoman as I read this on the plane.  Anthony Bourdain's sardonic no-apologies style kept me on the edge of hysterics, disgust, starvation and food-gasm throughout the book.  If you love food - not dining, not frou-frou, but FOOD - you have to read this book.",
ANOTHER WINNER,As great as all the others in this series!,
A Delicious Guide for the aspiring pie maker,"As I write this, I have the All Peach Pie in the oven (page 85 - 86). I've been getting into pie baking over the past three years. In the beginning, it was a real shot in the dark. I had no idea what I was doing, and the trash can ate more pies than anyone in my family. Eventually I started getting better, learning most from watching YouTube videos. Just a few weeks ago I discovered this book, and I learned more in those past weeks than I had in three years! I am overwhelmed with how amazing a resource this book is. Ken Haedrich is simply a pie genius. This work offers so much. It has so many helpful techniques from the best ways to roll your dough and perfect various types of crusts to the secrets of tasty and stylish pie toppings to selecting and preparing the fruit for your pies. There are even practical tips to troubleshoot your pies so you can learn where you're going wrong if your pies come out too soggy, if your dough is to hard or too dark, and more. A useful index allows you to pinpoint the exact type of pie you're looking to bake. This book is fantastic, such a great investment. Thus far each recipe I've made has been a big hit with my family and friends. If you're looking to impress, and take your pie baking skills to the next level, this book will take you there and fast.",
Was NOT impressed,"I really was looking forward to book 10. Even half way through it I was looking forward to book ten. What happened? It just never jelled.  LOTS of loose ends that never came together.  LOTS of plot points that never made sense. AND mostly it appears. LOTS of stress on a wonderful writer to put a book out to please fans that would have pleased those fans much more if she would have taken her time and just had worked it out more thoroughly.  The end left SO MUCH to be desired.  It was like Ms. Harris just gave up and said OK I'm tired....enough.  Frankly, that's the way I'm beginning to feel as well!",
Five Stars,Great item! Would highly recommend!,
Good story,Good story. Steady paced. Medical setting. I enjoyed it.,
Love this journal!,"Such a cute journal to help guide you in writing daily thoughts, goals, or whatever you would like to use it for. I love the quotes on each page and the ample space provided for writing!",
above a 10,"found a lost treasure for our daughters 48 th birthday...her grandfather  used to read to her from his book when she was little.  this company was outstanding with service...the book was in plastic, gift wrapping, a note enclosed, and wrapped in sturdy cardboard.....thank you",
Great writer,"Love his books, not not like paperback books.  Therefore I will not buy any more paperbacks too difficult to read he needs to do more of hardcover",
A Good Read  3 1/2 stars,Even though this book is part of the Tony Hill/ Carol Jordan series Val McDermid does an excellent job of making it a stand alone book. You don't  have to read the preceding books before reading it but afterwards you might want to...In the beginning of the book one woman's body is found and another woman has gone missing - are the two crimes connected? The author let me feel I was very clever by letting me think  that I'd figured it but then I would be wrong and this happened more than once. One thing I really liked about the author's writing is that even though terrible things happened the author didn't go overboard with graphic details which to me make some books totally unreadable...She also gives a good background and history for the characters but I also felt sometimes this slowed the book down and could have used a bit of editing.  How many times have we been told that juries expect to see evidence presented like on the tv show CSI. Also I didn't need to hear about budget cuts - it's a murder this evidence should be processed first...I enjoyed this book but I felt I would have liked it better as an audio book. I did listen to the audible sample and liked the narrator - when I read it I didn't feel I had the right British accent in my head.  I didn't figure out who did it but I think readers who read more crime mysteries will have.  This book did make me more interested in the books that preceded it.  Read as a netgalley copy.,
I love this series,"I loved Hidden Bodies and dare I say I love Joe! Joe is one crazy, scary killer just looking for true love. I love this series. The Author knows how to keep you on the edge. Hidden Bodies has great characters and even greater plot twists, I was riveted. I can't wait to read You Love Me...I give Hidden Bodies 5 stars for its great read..I would recommend this book to Thriller fans.",
"Psychics, Spies, Romance, San Francisco... what more could you want?","I absolutely loved this book! As a teen, I was really into psychic phenomena and tried very hard to develop my own psychic powers (to no avail...) Also, I've always thought that in another life, I'd be an international spy... ;-) So, I would've been completely obsessed with this book as a teen.... and now, as an adult (who is still into psychic phenomena and spies-- my binge-watching of ALIAS is proof of this), I was completely sucked into the story, too. It's stylishly written, with an awesome main girl character and an intriguing mystery-thriller-romance storyline. I appreciated how thoroughly original this story is-- it really stands apart from the other paranormal YA books out there. A captivating, mind-bending and pulse-pounding adventure!",
Weird and not Mathemagical,This is a very strange rendition of the princess and the pea. Despite the book's focus on finding a REAL princess this is never well defined and it was very confusing to explain. None of the characters are well developed or likable. The book misses an opportunity to incorporate math in some way which is meaningful to the story. Instead the numbers just seem to clutter the story and add to the confusion.,
Excellent book!,Very good book. I enjoyed it very much. Different than most writing styles.,
Five Stars,one of my fav authors,
"A great book, an important book.","Matt Taibbi chronicles the scams that are changing your life today, even if you have not been paying attention. Seriously, the dollar amounts are so large (measured in TRILLIONS of dollars) that even after dividing by US population size (300+ million) the effect on each of us is significant...Mr. Taibbi has a difficult task. These scams succeed because the financial methods employed are terribly complicated. Hence, there is not much need for secrecy. Instead, the scams succeed because most people do not understand the events that occur in plain sight...Mr. Taibbi's approach is to use language and emotion to make this information interesting. The outrage is clear enough, for example this now-famous blast..""The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.""..The book is divided into nine chapters plus an epilogue. Some of the chapters cover.. - The (subprime) mortgage scam that caused a crisis in 2008.. - Health care policies in the USA: a huge gift to the insurance industry.. - Goldman Sachs et al: not capitalist producers of goods, just takers...I like Matt Taibbi. He gets angry at these scams and it shows. How I wish there were more like him in government and journalism.",+

Great gift for yourself or anyone else close to you hard to buy for,"Exceeded my expectations given the price.  I originally bought this as a gift for my MIL as part of her bday present but when I got it, I just had to have one for myself and also bought 4 more for my gift closet :)...Perfect for even the least-Namaste type person.  It comes with starter pages with questions that will easily prompt answers to identify what you're grateful for.  This builds the foundation for your daily practice.  I think it's a great gift for the hard to buy for person.  If you want to jazz up your gift you could add a monogrammed pen since it's a hand-written diary/log.",

"A Brilliant, Seasoned Philosopher Speaks","This book isn't easy.  At times I felt I understood 1/2 of what he was saying - at other times closer to 2/3 or 3/4.  But that was enough to fuel some fun flights of cogitation.  A strong background in math would help appreciate this book, but there's plenty of meat here for even the more general philosopher (such as myself).  An entertaining thinker and writer.",

elegant,"Reader thoughts:..OK. I absolutely loved this book (yay for full-cast-audio), and it would the BEST ever except for this one scene I didn't like (the way Dashti defeated the bad guy, but at least it worked). That's me, picky...This book reminded me of Ella Enchanted in the sense that both authors use a lot of emotions to further the plot and side-characters that wreak havoc and the main character's love is in the dark about protagonist's biggest secret. SH, though, had a bigger overall plot involving countries, while GCL's was more compressed on a smaller scale within her own household (stepmother troubles and all that)...Oh, and I loved the worldbuilding here. What other fantasy story mentions a pet yak? The kingdom is ruled not by a king but a Kahn! Also, even the religious system is believable and well developed. The traditions, superstitions, history, and music are all well put together and just make the story even better.  And the songs are simple but perfect...Usually, I don't like journal stories, but SH pulled it off quite well. It's even better than The Goose Girl...Writer thoughts..Why did journalling work as a medium for this story, but it doesn't work for other stories? Here are my guesses...1, a lot of the conflicts lasted longer than one day. So, none of the danger was over when Dashti was penning the day's activities. She and Saren were still stuck in the tower, still starving. Sometimes Dashti even wrote in her journal while something was happening, and she would pause or sketch or wait in fear in the dark. This made the action feel real...2, inner dialogue and reflections. Dashti often added her own commentary later. Things like, &#34;I shouldn't have thought that about my lady; ancestors, forgive me!&#34; or &#34;Why didn't I say/do this?&#34; or &#34;I'll never forget the way he smells.&#34; It's delightful to read. We experience all her joy and regret with her...3, the journal was a plot point. First, she's chronicling her days in the tower, and the journal would be there to explain why two female corpses are locked in a tower. Later, she's lying about everything, and the journal would get her killed if someone found it. So, it is important. It's like the reader gets to hold a piece of the world.",
Five Stars,You should read it!,
Difficult and Frustrating,"A difficult and frustrating book to read from beginning to end; but what it set out to do, it does with the greatest integrity. Each of the poets, in their own way, uses language, the foundation of communication, to obscure meaning and themselves...The book is representative of many of the current formal presentations in vogue, especially including obstructive line breaks (including prose poems), and various cryptic arrangements of the poetry on the page intended to mystify and repel more than communicate. Every work is strongly redolent of academic seminars and workshops (indeed, many have the imprimatur of academic institutions), and there is very little evidence of life experience or extensive exposure to other poetry—old or new. I strongly suspect that, of the fifty “best young poets” represented here, none will still be writing poetry ten years from now--unless they're required to by their choice of an academic profession...Obviously, I prefer poetry that is artful communication between the author and the reader/listener. Poems that are accessible, without being intellectually demeaning, and that invite the reader to enter and participate in the conversation, instead of shamed into silence. These are not those; but they do it so deliberately, so consistently that they merit five stars for realizing their strength of conviction...I've followed this series with a great deal of interest. It's an exercise in self-examination. Best New Poets 2013 is due out any time now. Can't wait to see what I learn about myself from that one.",
Excellent Testimonial,"""Just Loving Them"" is an excellent testimonial of the story of Jeremy's life as he grows up, follows the Lord, and begins his own campfire ministry. Jeremy's book is an excellent example of how we can be servants of the Lord within our own community and show people Love, the commandment that God stressed most..This book is enjoyable, educational and a great example of setting our eyes on the things above, God and His son, Jesus...-Christian Fobian, Author of Why Christ?",

Bautiful story,Very heartfelt and lots of character development. Well written and entertaining. Good for all ages.,
Just perfect,This was the perfect gift for my parents who like to travel and look at a map when planning their trips. The atlas is mostly maps of individual countries with cities and roads clearly marked. Plus there are a few pages with general information. I highly recommend this purchase.,
Second Chance Romance,"I liked the main characters of this story and second chance romance is one of my favorite tropes. I love seeing couples get another chance for their happily ever after...I was given the audio version of this book by the author. I enjoy audiobooks generally. But I find I have a problem with American English speaking narrators. I think this narrator (and others) want to differentiate between the narration and the dialog. She did the dialog very well. I didn't have a problem with that. But it drives me crazy to have the intonation of the narration go up at the end of the sentence making everything sound like a question. And the story had a lot of narration. It is probably my own quirk but it still bothers me. So I think I would have enjoyed reading this myself more. I did enjoy the dialog though...I found the story line of the book interesting and I was driven to continue the story to find out how the problems would be resolved. I wasn't expecting the path the story took to get to the ending we all anticipated. I liked that there were second chances in more ways than just romance and I liked the reformation of those who needed it...Potential triggers: car accident, bear mauling, controlling parent.Moderate Christian themes.Sex: no.Language: no.Violence: Threatening speech, killing animals.*I received a complimentary audiobook and voluntarily chose to review the book.",

Thrilling Debut,"(No Spoilers) Part space opera, part adventure, and applicable to both young adult and adult readers, CassaStar is the thrilling debut novel by Alex J. Cavanaugh, science fiction writer and blogger...Alex has a simple writing style with good flow. I found myself quickly caught up in his prose. CassaStar is written in multiple PoV, limited to the two main characters of Byron and Bassa. Byron is an arrogant, insecure fighter pilot trainee, and Bassa is an experienced instructor with a stern disposition. I loved Bassa, and found Byron off-putting at first (though he does redeem himself). Particularly impressive was Alex's use of the telepathic abilities of Cassans in multiple point of view. At times it was omniscient, but very well done...The world-building in CassaStar is sparse, but intriguing, giving the reader a sense of the setting without inundating us with details. The pages turn quickly and I never found myself growing bored. CassaStar showcases character development in a science fiction atmosphere. It has many exciting moments of space combat, lasers, and explosions, but the core of CassaStar is the progression of Byron and Bassa. How they change and grow...This is one of the best science fiction debuts I have read in a long time. My largest complaint was a lack of female characters. Byron's sister makes an appearance, but it's short and lacks any reader empathy. What do these Cassan women do?..Outside of that, CassaStar was a wonderful read that I would recommend to anyone interested in character driven science fiction. If you're a big softy like me, you may cry a bit, so you've been warned. CassaStar sucked me in and held me rapt. I cannot wait to read Alex's next novel and watch his craft steadily improve. (4 Stars)",

A Fascinating Read..,"A remarkably candid and introspective memoir by William Shatner that should appeal beyond people merely interested in “Star Trek.”  Shatner is insightful, never pulling punches on his insecurities and imperfections, such as his rivalry and envy of costar Leonard Nimoy.  This frankness makes you admire him all the more.  Besides learning a lot about the author, you’ll find yourself equally enlightened about life.  William Shatner is a very interesting fellow with a wonderful sense of humor, but when he delves into the depths of his pain and disappointments, he attains depth not usually found in these sort of tomes.",
Five Stars,Great book! Thanks!,
So much alcohol,"Nice mystery. Unlikable characters. But what struck me most about this book was the excessive, overwhelming, repetitive emphasis on drinking. Even many of the characters were defined mostly by their drinking and drunkenness. To be fair, this seems to be a broader trend than just this particular book, but it did become tiresome.",
Fascinating Historial Thriller,"The mark of a truly great writer is the ability to write a well-developed protagonist of the opposite sex, and to no one's surprise who is familiar with his work, Mr. Bohjalian has not only done that in spades but done it in a setting from nearly 400 years ago. This book is a unicorn - a beautifully written and researched historical fiction novel that is also a thriller that keeps the reader guessing. The details that contribute to setting are meticulously researched, down to precisely accurate speech patterns and vocabulary. You will be interested in and rooting for the main character from the very first page to the very last. This is a story of the Puritan New World told from a completely different perspective - a feminist one. It was a delight from start to finish.",
Five Stars,first rate,
I prefer Andy to carry the lead!,Hard time getting into this series. Read the other series straight through. Think I miss the regular characters and humor. Can we go back to that grouping? just love Andy's sacasm and his character project his love for animals and care for humans. just not the same.,
Delightful book !,"Our six year old..  and her 40+ year old mother LOVED this book !  The illustrations greatly enhanced the fun story;  besides richly invoking Parisian city scapes, each page had a ""Where's Waldo"" quality as we looked for the items Simon lost.",+
"Different for King, but GREAT","This was a nice change from King's usual type of writing.  The story was interesting enough to enthrall all the thriller needs of a usual King fan, but it had a tenderness to it that was unexpected.  I really enjoyed this book more than expected. I expected to be entertained by it, just not as much as I was.  I love Stephen King's previous works, but I think with this novel, he really has gone to the next level.",
was expecting much more,"Since when did the category ""Young Adult"" turn into mediocre writing?.This book started out beautifully, albeit a little too self-conscious,  and then it turned predictable and hurried.  I realize that the author was very young when she wrote this book, but why should I give her a free pass?  Was the idea, that just because she IS young, she can relate to this genre's readers better? She can't..At a time in American history, when we are also intertwined in a constant and senseless war, I hoped that someone from our younger generation could have delivered a point of view that was much fresher and deeper than ""marry the hot enemy prince"" and poof instant peace and happy endings..The storyline slowed to a turtle pace after the halfway point of the book.  It lacked enough development at the end. This book needed to be 400 pages, not 260..The ending was the biggest disappointment of all, finishing like a cheesy romance novel, when I thought this book could have been so much more..The main female character, Danica, felt mostly flat, not reserved, though the male counterpart, Zane, was much more interesting and complex..I suppose, I'm disappointed because my expectations were too high. I hailed the publisher's advertising of a child protege writer, but in the end it left me wishing I hadn't wasted my money.",
The life of a tree,"What a delightful treat to read a book about the life of a tree and everyone who became a part of its world The characters and illustrations are wonderful and you can really feel a strong sense of commuity, friendship, and family. Well done Shelly.  A read I couldn’t put down and kept.me smiling all the way through.",
cat,my Grandkids love Pete.,
Disappointing and repetitive novel,"I did not finish this book. It was very repetitive and uninteresting. While I was looking forward to reading about Catherine of Aragon - books about Henry VIII typically focus on Anne Boleyn and ignore Catherine's motivations - the execution was poor. First, there were significant implausibilities in the portrayal of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Gregory protrays them as rather open minded and solicitous of Islamic practices. Catherine is portrayed as very appreciative of the Muslim legacy of Spain. This is absolutely ridiculous, considering the fact that Ferdinand and Isabella were brutal religious fanatics who sparked the infamous Spanish inquisition. Second, Gregory portrays the relationship between Catherine and Henry VIII's older brother, Prince Arthur as a love affair. I suppose it is possible, but very unlikely in that time period. Gregory's purpose, of course, is the key premise of this book - that Catherine of Aragon lied when she said that her marriage to Arthur was not consummated, which means that her marriage to Henry was unlawful under church law. However, the efforts to make this point are rather forced - the romance between Arthur and Catherine reads like a nauseating dime store romance",
Avalon High: Coronation #1: The Merlin Prophecy,"This wasn't too entirely horrible... I just didn't like the fact that it was so short and didn't really add much to the story. It would be way more worth it if there was more to it.....Still, it was interesting and easy and quick to read, I just wouldn't recommend buying it unless you really like manga. Or really like Meg Cabot. I really like Meg Cabot, but I would suggest you spend your money on her other full novels instead of the short manga. They're good to read, though. Interesting.",
Great book of poetry,I absolutely loved this book of poetry. The idea to tackle the usually unheard of women in history was great and I really like the way Duffy does it.,
A dark fantasy read that treats mental disorders with respect and reality,"I'm a hit or miss fantasy reader and I rarely enjoy sci-fi, BUT Edge of the Breach was an absolute hit for me. Where I dislike the genres is within the usual flowery prose or the worlds require me as the reader to suspend too much belief in order to follow a character arc. Yeah. That didn't happen in this book...Halo Scot wrote in a style that I love. While the descriptions were detailed with poetic (oftentimes vulgar poetry, but still elegant poetry) phrases, the style holds a modern taste that draws me in. By using first person points of view, Scot managed to engage me with laughter as well as drawing me into the emotions one feels when dealing with mental health issues such as OCD, depression, anxiety, and autism. Scot avoided overly simplistic summaries of the reactions (from both sides of the disorders--the sufferer and the supporters). Within the fantasy world Scot created, the emotions are very real. At times, it hurt to read, but I couldn't put the book down because I cared about the characters and their pain...Now, about the world within Edge of the Breach. It's fantastic. I mean that. Fantasy and wonderful. The details and rules of the world held. There were no easy or obvious fixes when the story got hard. Part of why I struggle with fantasy is that there tends to be a magical shield or that last moment saving item that appears and saves the day. Scot never went for the easy within this book. Instead, the characters and world stayed in tact. What worked was only through established personalities, skills, and available resources. Nothing easily appeared. There were no cheats. That kept me guessing and at no point did I have the ""oh, I know where this is going"" moment...I highly recommend this book. I'm already a bit annoyed that the sequel has yet to be written, because I want to know what comes next. That being said, whatever time Halo Scot needs to write the sequel as well as the first book in the Rift Cycle series, it will be worth it.",
Not My Cup Of Tea,"Though their are a few useful reminders here, I largely did not like this book...My perception is that the author comes to the self help/recovery/personal growth field from a strong marketing (money generating) perspective, which has always rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not saying an author (or a therapist for that matter) doesn't deserve to be well paid. I am saying that I have a problem with a recovery/personal growth specialist making $'s their #1 motivator...One example is much of a chapter plugging something called the &#34;Genius Network&#34;, which per the author costs $25k to join. As the author admits to being a professional blogger & entrepreneur, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a significant referral fee...He also talks about changing one's environment as being essential for success; but many (not all) of his suggestions require money. Some of us don't have a lot of that, & I wish the author's belief that all it takes to get money is to change your attitude was true; I don't find it that simple!..He takes the position that &#34;Nature&#34; (genetics) plays a much smaller role in mental health & self realization than &#34;Nurture&#34; which he renames &#34;Environment&#34;, while totally ignoring the fact that in much psychology theory how our parents raised us does have a strong impact, which requires work to change; & is often considered part of Nurture/Environment...I also find it ironic that many of his suggestions for changing one's environment (& I agree with some of his thoughts on that; especially removing unhealthy people from my life) require a ton of Willpower; which the book's main theme states doesn't work!..I'm aware that all other reviewers as of the time of this review hold this book in higher regard than I do, your mileage may vary. Though I have spent quite a bit more time thinking about what I read than this review may indicate; I really didn't find the book particularly useful to my journey.",$$
I highly recommend Anna's books .........,"I highly reccomend Anna'sbooks , they shipped same day I ordered , I got it super fast , love the book . Thank you so much Amazon and Anna's books !  ~ Denise Jolly ~ St. Augustine , Florida",~~
So pretty and LARGE!,This was really pretty and REALLY large! Definitely was time consuming and perfect for filling time during quarantine.,
A good book to read,I liked the book but it didn't seem to be as good as all the others in the Private series.  Of course I would advise others who read the other books in the series to read this one too but did not seem to move as fast as some of the others.,
The guide to navigating device overload,"This book talks very candidly about something we all know and fear... we are too connected and our technology can become the controlling piece to our lives. Without being &#34;anti-technology&#34;, Randi does a great job helping us see the balance.",
Dry and outdated - disappointing for such a relevant subject,"Draws the bulk of concepts and ideas from outdated data (1950s-1980s). It's difficult to believe that the field of medical sociology is so popular and growing, as the author states, and yet there is a serious lack of recent research. Disappointed that the book did not engage the reader as much as it could have - it was a very dry read.",
"poignant, scary, thrilling and sad (amazing read!)",I loved this book! I didnt put it down for 3 days and I will be reading more great novels from Matthew Bracken. He did a great job of starting the story out with all guns blazing and it doesnt stop for 600 pages. Great job Mr Bracken!! Keep em coming!,
Pages bent but book appears to be unread,"Condition of book was marked as very good.  Since the spine was stiff and pages clean, I’m guessing it was unread.  Top of spine was torn and that corner appeared to have been jammed, bending all pages and covers.  Because the condition was listed as Very Good, I’m guessing this happened in shipping, packaging was plastic bubble wrap, big enough to allow the book to slide around.",
A nod to the Ravenloft books I loved so much growing up,"PALADIN UNBOUND was an exciting and fast-paced break following immediately on the heels of the intense marathon read that was Dragon Mage. There are certain books that hit at just the right time and I didn't know how much I needed this story until I sat down and began reading it. Part quest fantasy, part dark adventure, with a splash of vampires and horror thrown in the mix, and this story turned out to be such a cool blend of so much of what I love in a killer read...The first thing that struck me about this book is the fantastic worldbuilding. Evelium is very much a wondrous traditional fantasy setting but with a dark edge that hints at a tumultuous and deadly past. We get glimpses of the history of this world at the beginning of each chapter by way of snippets taken from historical texts. It's alluded to that these texts were uncovered over the years by way of excavations. I really liked this technique because it provided a valuable context to the story without it feeling like info-dumping...This book also deals a good deal with prejudice and stereotypes. The main character Umhra is a half-blood orc who often encounters derision and suspicion wherever he goes. Life isn't easy for he and his band of mercenaries as many jobs go to a more ""acceptable"" segment of clients. It's extremely surprising then when he is given the delicate mission of finding out what happened to a group of well-placed and respected dignitaries/soldiers who may have ventured into cursed Telsidor Keep only to then not return. Why assign this task to Umhra? Why now? Could it be because he and his cohorts are seen as expendable, or is there a deeper and more significant reason?..Once the mission gets under way this story really takes off and becomes a breakneck dark adventure fantasy to the thrilling final page. This is a truly delightful multi-faceted story that took me places that I wasn't expecting. I think that the addition of some horror elements gave this one a very Ravenloft feel, which hearkened back to my glory days of devouring those books one after another when I was first cutting my teeth on fantasy as a genre...Suffice to say that Jeffrey Speight has written a wonderful first book that bodes incredibly well for future volumes. I had an absolute blast reading this and the story hit me with all the nostalgic feels that makes this such an entertaining experience from start to finish. Pick up this book if you love quick reads that grab your attention right from the jump and never let go. I can't wait to read the next book that Speight puts out because PALADIN UNBOUND, although entirely satisfying and amazing, left me wanting more of this type of story. Hopefully we won't have very long to wait!",
Nice book,Given as a gift.  Well received.,
good ld clean murder mystery,"good murder mystery... however if you listen /read to many of these back to back they do get redundant (same same same) recipes are nice for those who cook, personally I zone out during them as even they all sound the same to this non-baker.",
Great series!!,"Once again this author gives us another gripping, suspenseful story with a sad but heartwarming ending. Once I started reading it was so hard to put it down.",
It’s cute,"It’s ok, but more for a kid",
Don't Publish Until You Read This Powerful Book!,"FYI... I have Dr. Gray Webb writing my descriptions for about two years. I believe his descriptions have helped me get into the over $1000.00 monthly Amazon commission category..This manual reveals his strategies that make him so successful. Dr. Webb takes you by the hand and guides you step-by-step to writing a selling description. I was surprised to discover how easy it is, by simply following his directions. He not only tells you how to write but he also covers layout, formatting, grammar and what mistakes to look out for. He give you links for free software and people who will help you..If you have written a book or plan to write a book, you need this handbook. Don't publish until you read this powerful book. If you have already published you will want to redo your description to increase sales..Highly Recommended!",$
A good book and a GREAT IDEA!,"This book is being unfairly reviewed by socialists who wish for power to remain in Washington instead of being returned to the people of our great nation.  A national sales tax removes power from Washington, and returns it to where it SHOULD be, you and me.  The leftist agenda is JUST the opposite.  The direction of Karl Marx is to implement a progressive income tax as the first step to move from capitalism to communism.  We've done that in the USA, which speaks to just how stupid politicians can be.  However, it's not too late to change!  Let's tell Washington that we want our capitalism left alone!  It's not perfect, but it's better than Communism or Socialism, as the former USSR and the current Franco-German economic model prove...Do not believe the naysayers.  This is an excellent book, and an even better idea.  Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder are true patriots, and the Fair Tax is the salvation of our economy, our autonomy, our civil liberties, and our nation as a whole.  Otherwise, the inevitable march toward socialism and gov't ownership of you and me will continue.  Anyone who has been audited knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.",
Heckuva great read,"I am a big fan of short horror story collections and I was happy to have added this one to my collection..Kasey Hill is an extremely talented author and I am planning on buying more of her work..Out of them all, I'd have to say ""Damned Are The Children of Eden"" was my absolute favorite.  I am a big fan of the urban legend of black eyed children..Get this book, pick any story, and you'll love it..Kasey has earned her 5 stars on this book for sure.",
Five Stars,Purrfectly good read!.=^..^=,=^^=
Best childhood book ever,"My all time favorite childhood book, now I get to pass it on to my neice. Funny how reading it as an adult the end of the story always gets me emotional. Love this book and highly recommend it. Shipping was fast.",
Still waters,I love every Debra Webb book that I have read and this one is right up there. Amber is a news reporter and a killer has her in his sight. Sean is her bodyguard. Once you get started you won't put this book down. It's so good...,

Great book!,"This was an awesome book.  I have always been a huge Kinison fan, and thought I knew everything about Sam, but this book proved me wrong.  Very informative, and sad in places, this is a great read.  I would recommend this book to anyone.",
"Fast moving, exciting tale","A very exciting tale of the French underground. I thought it was very good, and difficult to put down!  In my opinion, this is the author’s best book.",
Cannot be downloaded on my kindle,I would like a refund,
Cutest little book,"The characters in this book are so cute, it’s makes you not want to put it down. I would recommend this book for any age group. So relaxing and stress free. Great gift for all ages, they would love it!",
Futility in Poor English and Bad Writing,"This is the same book as book 2 of the trilogy except the chase is going southeast instead of southwest as was in book 2. The same repetition of chasing sequences and the same repetition of daily camping at night and up in the morning and porridge eating goes on throughout the entire book with no variation. It missed a good chance to explore the hostility between the Hittites and the Mittanis and a chance for great stories..Once again, the same editing and proofreading errors are all over the place which made the reading very painful. It is mind bugling to think that the publisher will accept books that do not have the command of simple English. Has the education level of the public really got so bad that even these professionals do not know correct English any more?",
I love paper dolls and who doesn't love Fancy Nancy,These are just the cutest books! I love paper dolls and who doesn't love Fancy Nancy! Perfect gift option!  DANCE RECITAL GIFT!,
I realy enjoyed this book,"I really enjoyed this book.  I liked the different way the story was presented and I loved the strong female protagonist.  Paddlers will especially enjoy the story as it really delves into the mind of the paddler and how to read water - especially running water..There are some slow spots, and I wanted a bigger reveal at the end, but I recommend this as a YA, adult or older juvenile read.",
Wonderful book and worthy cause!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Diana's book &quot;Flight To Freedom&quot;.  I now have a much better understanding about what it takes to rehabilitate raptors.  Diana has dedicated her life to helping injured and sick raptors including owls, hawks, eagles and falcons.  As a neighbor of Diana's I have personally visited her facilities and met her resident owls.  They are incredible creatures and are in very capable hands with Diana.  When I found a Great Horned owl in distress recently, I called Diana and she was there within minutes to help me catch the bird and bring it back to her facility.  I am so thankful there are people like Diana to help rescue and rehabilitate raptors so that they may be released back to the wild.  Thank you Diana!",
Excellent Study and Devotional!,"Elizabeth provides a wonderful insight to every scripture with her devotional prayer at the end of each passage. I bought the hard copy and it is easy to read, and ell worth the money...She has a solid understanding of what the scripture says and the prayers she adds to each 1 are certainly encouraging...I highly recommend the hard copy as the print is larger and easy to read. Plus I can bring it anywhere and pick it right up. Book arrived a few days after ordering and now sits on my table next to me.",
Jack Noble is back....,"I have been waiting for this one!  Jack Noble is back in true form and on a case that takes him to a murkier side of right and wrong. Add a beautiful disgraced FBI Agent, along with Jack’s sidekick, Bear; we have the recipe for an unforgettable mystery, lots of deadly action and even more suspense.  End Game is a fabulous novel!",
vague items,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly but certain vague items interupted my pleasure.  Of course, anything to do with cricket, I glossed along.  Especially bothersome were the final pages.  Hans meets his family on a July evening in London and they go for a ride on ??  What?, is it some famous landmark I should know but don't? Is is a helicopter?  Please advise..P.S.  It would be interesting to go back and cut and paste the book and present it in chronological order.  I have a hunch the story would decline in interest.",
Wow! Terrific,"The author has removed the ""dismal"" from the label in this wonderfully written book, though I listened to the excellent audio.  We know that to attach ""science"" to economics is an oxymoron. Economists don't venture out into the real world. But Mr. Kishtany does, connecting theory to events creating a faSCINATING WORK. i WISH THIS BOOK WAS LONGER. . Naturally, academis economists, buried in algorhythms, will sneer at this work.  If you want an overview, don't miss this book.",
