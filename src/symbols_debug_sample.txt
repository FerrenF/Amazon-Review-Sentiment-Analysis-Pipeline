My 3 years in Belgium is ending ... this book was a big help!,"All in all, in my 3 years living in Belgium, I found this a really helpful guide book.  Prices are always wrong in guidebooks, but I found the contact information (web, address, phone) nearly always right, and the descriptions accurate...You will be very challenged to find another guidebook that has this level of coverage of Belgium in its entirety, as most seem to focus on Brussels, Gent, Bruges, and perhaps Antwerp.  Belgium seems to typically be an afterthought on most tourists' itineraries...I really enjoyed the author's picks, both hotels and restaurants.  What can I say to the other reviewer where the hotel unfortunately cancelled their booking because they found a group that would pay them more?  Is that the authors' fault?  No, welcome to Europe, and to Belgium, where the customer is always ... wrong!!..So you're browsing guidebooks, and wondering which one to get?..I would have to say, based on my experience using an earlier edition of this book for the past 3 years (I imagine they're pretty similar!), if you're swinging through Belgium for 2 days, and going to see Brussels and Bruges, this book is probably not the best for you.  You'll probably do better with a thinner city-specific guidebook.  But if you're going to tour around Belgium, or spend an extended amount of time in a city or two, then the in-depth coverage of this book is a real benefit...One criticim I do have to echo:  Lonely Planet, let's face it, is not known for its maps, and this book is no exception.  They're good enough, and I've never NOT been able to find something, but sometimes the maps, er, well, don't necessarily reflect reality...So all in all, this is a solid book, and if you follow my advice in paragraph 5, I think you'll be happy with it.",
Great read!,"I loved it.  It is so different from all of her other books, which I have also read and loved.",

Fun book to read,My 9 year-old loves to read these books.  As long as he's interested I will continue to get these books for him.,
Five Stars,"Heartbreaking, beautiful",
"Wow, harder than I thought","This book has some pieces that need fast moving fingers. I need to work back up to this.  I used to be a good flutist, but it's been years since I have really played. I do like that it comes with a CD so you can hear what it should sound like. This is by no means a book for beginners, but challenging good music selection",
Five Stars,thank you great job,
Egypt,"A very good book.Atmospheric, reflects the current environment in Egypt..Plus good characters and plot, will read more of this author's work",
A Must Watch,Five stars but for adults only..Love the plot twists which are impossible to anticipate..A must watch.,

3 in 1...what a deal!!!,"It's great when one of your best friends just happens to own a book shop. I found this trilogy of Nora's in the book shop and got a great deal on it. I think my favorite was Finding The Dream, with Laura Templeton & Michael Fury, probably because he's the handsome, dangerous type of guy that every woman wants to fall in love with.  And he struggled to be good enough for where he  finally ended up. And she was so level-headed in so many ways, except the creep of a husband she was married to. Laura struggles with her two daughters after she divorces their father, with the oldest blaming Laura for his departure. Kids can be so cruel when they don't understand. The story just took me to tears at times. Then too, I really enjoyed Daring to Dream with Margo and Josh Templeton. She finds out about her mother's one and only love, Margo's father, and Margo regains a relationship with her mother that she'd felt was lost. Margo is the beautiful, well-built woman that every man dreams about, but she's a wild child that Josh Templeton has long been waiting for to return home. The dialogue is great, both witty and warm at the same time. Margo is nearly bankrupt when she returns to Templeton House, but finds her roots again, not only with starting a new business, but also with her mother. Josh was my second favorite of the men in this trilogy. He's so cool...And then there's Holding The Dream with Kate and Byron. This story was okay, but not nearly the page-turner that the other two were. But Kate is an altogether different type of woman than Laura and Margo. It's the bond that holds them together as sisters, even though they aren't, that I really found endearing. This trilogy was great. I'm glad I found it.",
"Great Value, Great Magazine",I missed getting this in the store and the markup wasn't that much.  It's a great magazine and something to treasure now that the show is gone for good (seemingly)!,
Good Read,I enjoy legal thrillers and this did not disappoint. The one I thought was the killer wasn't. The characters were well developed. My only complaint is the constant reminders that she and her famiy are east lake trash. This is one of the better books I have read on Kindle Unlimited recently. I plan to read the next one in the series.,
An Invaluable Resource,"""Grassroots Marketing"" is an excellent textbook on small business marketing and advertising. It is an enjoyable and useful book. After reading the book, one will really understand that marketing is all about understanding the customer needs and finding solutions that delight the customer. The reader will come to appreciate that marketing is a philosophy of doing business for those organisations that are going to thrive in the current highly competitive markets...This work is densely packed with valuable insights, guidance, and marketing techniques. It offers enormous potential to receptive and motivated readers who are able to move from thought to action. The book carries pertinent information, but it is organized and written in such a way that is easily digestible...I would recommend it to newcomers to marketing or business entrepreneurs or small business consultants or trainers or those who just wants some insight into how to effectively market goods or services.",
Four Stars,Very helpful to my artist wife.,
Excellent!,Fast shipping! Excellent!,

Cute,cute book that I bought for my nieces.,
Fascinating.,Fascinating.,
Not the page turner the rest of Grisham books are.,"A bit repetitive, didn't at all like the too many emails between the students and their loan officers - as an attorney with student loans, I have never received an email from the lender.  Zola cries the whole way through.  I also didn't believe the loyalty these three showed to one another.  Law students are competitive.  It wrapped up nicely but to name the new bar the Rooster Bar = how to get the FBI to find you in the country where Zola is from and left to see her parents.  Grisham is the best writer and the only one I read but this one is not his best (least fav after the baseball and Christmas stories and the horrible ending of the Testament.)  The rest were all five star novels.  Worth the read, just not his best.  Not the page turner almost all of his other novels are.",=
Elvis: By the Presleys,It was nice to be able to read about Elvis from Priscilla's perspective.  I recommend it.,

good,good,
Great kids book,Loved it so much we bought all her other books and we are going to make her into our Halloween costume!,
"shame, there could have been so much potential...","I must say that this book had a lot of potential. It is a shame that there wasn't a good editor present before the book was published. I do not see myself as a &#34;Grammer nazi&#34; in anyway, but parts of the book lost their appeal when the Grammer was imcorrect. Also, the book took a bit of a Twilight twist during the &#34;present&#34; part of the book. It was a little disturbing that a 600 year old lady was sleeping  with a 16 year old boy and kept repeating high school over and over. I enjoyed the &#34;past&#34; much more and found myself skipping whole &#34;present&#34; chapters. All in all it was ok. I am not convinced to purchase the second book.",
Great.,My grandson really enjoyed it 😊,😊
Great story and beautiful pictures,We love this book.  Very nice printing and pictures.  It is a short story for beginning chapter book readers.  Highly recommended.,
Ahhhhh!,"I cried, I laughed and at the end I have a HUGE smile on my face! Rion had me laughing so hard yet again and I'm going to miss reading about him! In this book we meet Nick and Logan which added a new spin in things which I liked. There's surprises, danger, betrayal and a happy ending. Love love loved this series!",
Great read,Enjoyed this very much. It may be 20 years old but it's a great plot with an intriguing and educational view into Japanese culture and Bushido.,
Not as useful as I had hoped,"I had hoped this would be a quick resource to aid me in my ESL classroom when communicating with parents.  Not really.  I flipped through it a few times, and then gave it away.",
Great especially for students without a lot of formal education in Spanish!,Very helpful book for students who are not advanced in the grammar of Spanish. I use this with my students as  workbook and it has produced great results!,
a great thriller!,"An edge of your seat thriller wi Kendra as the person who is the sensor and Adam Lynch as the former FBI agent, a gun for hire for the good guys. Random people are dying in the San Diego area with no connection except they were knifed..We meet the regional FBI office staff, get to know them as well as Kendra, Lynch and Olivia who is Kendra’s life long friend..They follow clues Questioning people and she reads the clues her senses pick up. Soon they become targets. Great characters and very interesting plot.",
Hooray for high interst books!,A fun story and very readable! High interest reading for even my struggling second graders.,
Well-written and evocative,"Having grown up in Montana, I know only too well the predjudice against Native Americans that exists there. The heroine, Win, is a brave young girl who goes against cultural expectations, and takes up with Bell, a Native American. What happens is described evocatively and makes it hard to put down.",
Artist,"Treat yourself by spending time reading Patti Smith’s memoir titled, Year of the Monkey. This multi-dimensional talented artist offers readers her memories, dreams, impressions, and experiences of 2016. We travel with her during this year and thanks to her poetic language, we feel what she felt. Thanks to her photographs, we see a few of the things that her artistic eye captured. Most of all, we get to admire a talented artist use many of her skills to try to reveal herself to us and to help us reveal ourselves to the world...Rating: Four-star (I like it)",
Thumbs up!,"My 14 month old really enjoys this book.  It has the cow, pig, sheep, cat, and dog in it so it's not too much to throw at him at one time.  The colors are bright too. it so much,  It's simple enough to not overwhelm him yet he learns from it too.",
It's a page Turner.,I love the whole series. Blood Echo was fast paced and exciting. Already looking forward to next one.,
Awesome Book!,I think this book is great.So informative.I did start this diet on Dec. 8th before I received the book and I have actually lost 3 lbs.I don't know if it as just water or not but I can tell you that this diet is not hard at all. You eat 500 calories every other day and then as much as you want on the alternative days.In the book there are a lot of recipe ideas. Ideas including entrees fresh or frozen and snacks.Lots of info.Also a maintenance plan for after you reach your goal! I would recommend this highly.,
Great British mystery series,We’ve been watching the Morse series on Prime Video and these books are the original writing about the characters. Excellent read and having the whole set has been cool. The nice thing is that they didn’t spoil the TV version,
Fantastical Fantasy,"The Orphan Queen was a slow start.  That being said, by the time I got to the end, I was racing through on the edge of my seat, and now I am dying to know more (and secretly building a time machine to the future to pick up book #2).  I loved the main character Wil in this novel.  She was solid, purposeful and while she did have some moments to whiny teenage angst, they were mostly justified (what with witnessing her parents murders as a child).  I LOOOVED the character Black Knife.  Jodi Meadows has a way with her male leads that draws you in with the first meeting.  The world building was adequate.  The world itself, fascinating and mysterious, however, our interaction with it as the reader was somewhat limited.  There are several novellas planned in the series, unfortunately, I do not think they will be enough to quell my desire to know more about the world and the ancillary characters involved in the story.  Overall, I did grow to really enjoy this novel and am sad that it is only a duology as I think there is so much material smooshed into this one book that could have been developed in a longer series...Final Recommendations:  if you love high fantasy, mysterious organizations, even more mysterious vigilantes, swoony romance, royal jerks, strange magic",
Lisbeth lives on!,"David Lagercrantz comes very, very close to duplicating Stieg Larsson’s  “Lisbeth Salandar” trilogy which thoughlly enjoyed.  I will buy Lagercrantz‘s next novel that continues the theme and characters.",
Jan Brett. I don't need to say more...,Jan Brett's books are incredible. The stories and illustrations are so detailed and beautiful. Every time I see a new Jan Brett book I pick it up. I have quite a collection now.,
Just OK.,"The premise of this book is what attracted me to it. A group of neighbours meet for bookclub when a stranger joins in and gets them to drink(to lose their inhibitions) and play Never Have I Ever. The problem for me is that very early on I disliked both main characters (Amy and Roux), who become rivals. My next issue was that so much of the story was totally implausible. Not only was Roux blackmailing Amy, but she was also guilty of kidnapping a teenage boy who she passed off as her son and blackmailing several of the other neighbours. Moreover, Amy's friend Char came off as weak and Davis resembled a spineless man. An OK read, but not what I'd describe as a thriller.",
"A Thought Provoking, Interesting Story","I found this book to be a great read. Right from the start you are drawn into the life of one of the four very different, but fascinating characters. It has you wondering why he would commit such a act. As you travel back in time to war torn Italy, you slowly grow to understand with the help of his three fellow soldiers, the Italian people of this small village, scarred by the horrors they had witnessed, and the small Italian boy he had rescued. The book is SO much better than the movie. PLEASE take the time to read it. All the wonderful details, descriptions, and emotions are missing in the movie.",
I am readding the book now,The book goes with the flow with how the.event took place when Trump was running.for office. So far so good. Barbara A Barclay,
Chaos Mode,"This is a very good book as all the books in this series are. However, if the only thing you've seen of Piers Anthony is his Xanth series that is so popular, then you may want to screen this for the kids. All of these books deal with adult issues. You can judge whether someone is mature enough to read it, but all the books in this series follow a girl who is suicidal, the older man she loves and who loves her and their various companions. They deal with issues like suicide, rape, sex, etc... They do it in good way that is relevant and fits into the story. The story is about a girl Coleen, who was raped at a party once. Her father is an adulterer and her mother is a drunk. She puts on a good act and is a very popular girl on the outside, but cuts her self and frequently contemplates suicide, though she's very smart. One day on the way home from school, she comes across a man passed out in a ditch. Her suicidal nature leads her to take him home. After learning a little of each others language, he says that he's from another world/mode and that he wants to take her to be his wife there. She doesn't believe him and he disappears. She believes him and realizes she's made a mistake and he realizes he shouldn't have left. The method he takes is random though and the only way to reliably get back to Coleen is by invoking a virtual mode. The rest of the story is about how Coleen and Darren are trying to find each other and get back to his mode. They continuously encounter problems and solve them with the help of their friends from the other anchor modes. The whole time Coleen is trying to deal with her issues so that she can be with Darren in a health relationship. So there are many different things going on in this series and I have just gone over the general gist so that I don't give anything away. Everything is done in a tasteful manner, but as I said it contains very adult subject matter. Enjoy.",
Five Stars,Great science and science writing!  This book is a wonderful companion for &#34;The Next Tsunami&#34; by Bonnie Henderson.,
Excellent!,Great book! Could hardly put this one down!  Good story and great writing!  Definitely will read more by this  author an  can't wait to read  the next one!,

A childhood must have!,"Classic set, and was a must to purchase for our newborn.  My wife enjoys reading to him as he falls asleep, and when he is older he will read them to us.",
Read this book,"It's the best book you'll ever read, after reading the hunger games by Susan Collins, I thought I would never find a book that could even compare to it. But despite being biased to the hunger games, I thought this book was better than the hunger games. Although they are not alike, both are amazing books. Even if u haven't read the hunger games, u should still read this book, it was aging and I wish it never ended so that I could just keep reading.",
Five Stars,Awesome book. Very intertaining....,
An intimate reflection upon the lifelong connection Morris Day had with Prince.,"I never used to be a huge Morris Day fan but I am now! I was at Paisley Park when the Time performed 2 months before Prince died. At the time I had no idea how special that night would become years later with Prince finally making amends with Morris. I believe Prince new he was leaving us soon and it was important for him to say goodbye to Morris Day, the band members and all the great memories.",
This book is a complete waste of time,"This book is a complete waste of time, first of the colored bold face type throughout the book makes it annoying to read, the color charts are not an accurate representation of the true shades. I think their first book is the best, after that most of the books have only a small portion that is applicable to any one body type. This is a very basic book and probably good for the color blind.",
Just Excellent,Excellent book. Will change the way you look at life. I was so impressed by this book that I ordered most of the other books written by this author. I was equally impressed and enjoyed each one. You feel uplifted after reading them.  I now send this book to friend's and relatives as a gift who I think it may benefit. I have never done this before with any book.,
Five Stars,Good read,
Bargus,"Although the story line was unique, and the plot kept me guessing until nearly the end who the stalker was, once again I find it difficult to &#34;love&#34; Ms Staub's use of verbs in the present tense (ie: she is leaving the room, she sits up, etc) which is distracting.  It was ok for the price but I would not read this book again or recommend it.",
So cute!!,"This book is adorable. The flaps are sturdy and small, difficult for an infant to really grab with a fistful and tear. She has to use her pincer grip to even touch the flaps (at 9 mo).",
"Excellent, everything I expected and more","""101 Fat Quarter Bags"" is a great buy. Clear sewing instructions and a wide variety of great ideas will have me sewing on these for a long time.",
Soap opera history,"I truly like it, though I missed Herod. He was such a main character in the series on the BBC, I was surprised he was unmentioned. The second volume fills in all of Herod's antics right away in flashback fashion. That filled in the missing part.",
Kesinlikle okunmali,"Nice book, good seller",
Another great book by Robin,"I enjoyed traveling across Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada with the characters as I have been to several of the places mentioned. I can relate to Jared and his desire for revenge as I have experienced lots of pain in my day and have had thoughts of revenge myself. But I have seen the effects of anger and bitterness in people and have learned that the need for revenge can destroy you if you are not careful. Fortunately, I saw this in a very close family member and I decided that only God can judge and it is my job to forgive so I don't let the bitterness affect me. This is the third book I have recently read from Robin and I can honestly say that she is now one of my favorite authors.",
Skip this Mess,"This book was so bad, I'm not even sure who the author is or what his job was. What high priced attorney makes his investigator sleep on the floor and have no access to office machines? This book is nothing more than a compilation of other people's work. I didn't.t get past chapter two. Terrible whinny writing with a dash of smart a$$. I wanted to punch this guy just for being him. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. There isn't anyone who thinks Scottie is innocent but this clown tried to make a case that cops jumped to conclusions. Would have , could have, been an interesting book but there was no meat on the bones. Plus his authorial voice was annoying.",$$

Little Miss History Travels... Get Your Complete Set Today!,"Little Miss History Travels to Ellis Island is another amazingly well-written book with so much history. What I love most about this author's books is historical information coupled with rich truths/facts and fantastic illustrations...I just knew I'd enjoy this book, and so many others will, too. We are living during an era where there's much talk about immigration, and immigration laws, so books like this one will usurp much diverse conversations. Adults can help children sort through puzzling questions using respectful discourse one to another...School officials: History teachers, and librarians should have loads of these books on campuses, and classrooms all over. Parents: You will want a complete set of the &#34;Little Miss History Travels to...&#34; books in your home library as well...Get yours today!",
"Authentic, vivid, and heartbreaking","I am, perhaps unsurprisingly, a very big fan of Cormac McCarthy's western novels.  And horses.  After my acquaintance with both, I can say with no reservations that the way Hagy writes horses and the west is authentic and vivid.  While Will Testerman occupies many more pages of narrative than the horse of the title does, Boleto (or ""Ticket"") is by far the most tangibly drawn character in the book, and not just because we know what color she is...I was strongly reminded of McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679744398 All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, Book 1)]] in many ways, but Hagy has her own voice.  Testerman is in many ways an admirable character and a pleasure to read about.  Even if he does live under a sense of constant failure, he has a real heart for serving others, even when it's difficult.  The themes of the human-horse relationship and betrayal were powerful ones, and used well.  At a crucial point in the story (won't spoil it), I felt my stomach drop along with Will's, and I very nearly cried at the book's conclusion...Perhaps the only thing I can say negative about the novel - and it's no small thing - is the gratuitous sex (and extremely gratuitous, vulgar descriptions) throughout.  When reading McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679760849 The Crossing (The Border Trilogy, Book 2)]] in class years ago, a classmate said ""This isn't realistic at all - he doesn't have sex!""  Well, Testerman certainly makes up for Billy Parham's celibacy.  I don't expect Testerman to abstain from all female contact - but the explicit and unnecessary descriptions of his many, many encounters, while they didn't completely ruin the book for me, made me decide against keeping it.  I can't ever imagine wanting to reread those passages again...I'd love to read some of Hagy's other work - this book has certainly given me a taste for it.  She knows how to use her words economically and with restraint, while still allowing expression for sublime beauty.  I just wish she didn't think she had to be vulgar to be realistic.",
I ran out right away.....,"to buy this book, as two of the author's others: The Sensualist and The Tattooed Map are two of my alltime favorite books.  Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. This is the story of Hippolyte, to me an annoying, unlikeable and dirty smelly explorer type (hmmm...the heroine in The Tattooed Map was also none too clean..)who sets out to find some islands that supposedly do not exist. Sounds like a good story, right? Well, it would have been, except that the bulk of the story consists of Hippolyte trying to convince his editor that his journey was fact and not fiction, as she believes. This is done mostly through letters and notes of historical facts sent back and forth. The &quot;finding the islands&quot; part was way too small, and the rest of the book was sooo boring that any mystery etc. regarding these islands is overshadowed by the simple fact that I didn't want to read on. Also, there is some kind of completely unbelievable romance type thing beginning between Hippolyte and his editor Marie that begins to make the book a little bit more interesting, but it never fully develops into anything. Because I paid full price for this book, I forced myself to finish it. I must say that the illustrations did distract from the boredom of the continuous facts and figures in the book, thus raising it's rating from two to three stars.  All in all, I was sorely disappointed, especially since I was so looking forward to another novel by this, one of my favorite authors.",
Three Stars,good strories,
Introduction to the New Testament by Raymond Brown,"This is a great book. Ray Brown is a scholar who has the ability to write so clearly that he is able to pull together years of study and scholarship and bring beginners, students and Scripture readers up to speed on the latest in Biblical understand. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the Bible and how to read it and understand it.",

Great for geocaching!,We are currently geocaching through every Indiana county. This very detailed map allows us to zoom in on all the areas that we visit. It's entertaining to follow along as a the passenger. Even the smallest of attractions are shown on this map which makes traveling more enjoyable.,
I loved Harri!!,"Meet Tracy Clark's new Detective Harriet ""Harri"" Foster! Hide takes place in Chicago and is a mystery/crime genre book, which is my favorite! It's told from the criminal's POV, as well as the investigator's POV...I liked Harri, whose life has been incredibly challenging for the past few years. She not only lost her son five years ago she also lost her last partner to suicide. She is now working in a different precinct - one that has a team of detectives who are a mix of good and bad...Harri struck me as a person who was as kind as she was intelligent...*SPOILER BELOW*..[Make that she HAD been intelligent, right up until the last part of the book. I SO dislike books where a detective (or detectives) goes off on his or her own, without telling anyone what they are doing or where they are going.🙄]..*END OF SPOILER*..Having said that, I felt the good outweighed the bad, and I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, called Fall!!",🙄
"Mr. Sandford, you forgot to take your shoes off.","On the whole, I enjoyed the book, but there was one thing that bugged me a lot. The book takes place in Minnesota, during the winter. It is often snowing. I have lived in Minnesota for over 60 years, and it seems  the (stated) author also lived here from 1978 to at least 1989, based on Wikipedia..The book's narrative is quite detailed, but never, not once, does anyone take off their shoes when they enter a house. And you just don't do that in Minnesota, when there is snow on the ground.",
endofthesentence,"Wonderful book, I love all of Mary Alice Monroe's book and this was no exception.",

Can beauty rise from ashes?,"Well written, easy to read and follow, and emotionally raw, this novel digs deep into the lasting trauma and scars of a painful past. Kaitlyn skillfully connects us into the MC’s thoughts as he struggles to deal with demons that have haunted him for years. Can he come to terms and open up his heart to a girl who needs him? It’s a story of camaraderie born of heartache and tragic circumstances set in a world much like our own, yet so strangely different..Please note: The themes discussed are most suitable for adult readers, and I received a review copy of this book.",
Husband's Book,Ordered these for my husband upon his request. He said they were great reads and he really enjoyed them. He recommends them,

Visionary Science Fiction,"Most of this novel concerns the fate of a cryonically frozen head of an upper class lady. Along the way David Marusek introduces us to the future, circa 2130. It is amazing and dazzyling indeed. David writes in a style that seems to transport the reader to this future, visionary in the utmost, an apparent roadmap to this future age with it's near magical technology, including rejuvenation science, ubiquitous holograms, advanced A.I., clones, nanotech, and much more. I found this book to be a page-turner, and very realistic, these to me are hard to find. And this is the first novel by Marusek at that! The overall plot and character development were superb, and bear in mind that the ending does allow a sequel without any problem, if so, count me in...",

Longer sentences, with simple vocabulary and a ""chapter"" organization make this book perfect for kids who aren't quite ready for chapter books yet. As Fox and Crow squabble over cheese (their favorite snack) readers will be surprised and pleased to see them both get their much deserved comeuppance from Mama Bear.",
Good,enjoyed the book.  Was a quick read.Same old virgil Flowers working  with the usual group.,
A lovely book,This is a lovely book that helps you create a little chapel of contemplation.  This is a book that can be utilized by the whole family and encourages contemplation that creates a little &#34;chapel of the mind.&#34;  Highly recommended.,
Two Stars,"The illustrations are good, but context is ridiculous.",
Really good read! Read it all in one day because I couldn’t put it down!,Goes to show you really don’t know people. Chilling because of the realism. I love the details of the individuals lives and how they are able to tell the story from multiple perspectives.,
A good Read and lots of info,A good read.  Bob has a great sense of humor so it was enjoyable!  He give plenty of details that i was not able to find elsewhere.  Even includes several blueprints for DIYers!,
Beautiful quality & beautiful cards,"Loved these  - bought for ""happy new year"" - were better than expected!",
Breath of fresh air,"I picked this book up recently and absolutely devoured it. The characters are very well written.  The town is painted so realistically, I feel like I've been there.  I love the history of Serenity Falls, and the story within a story...I've always enjoyed Moore's books, but this series is quickly becoming my favorite...I have the second book, The Pack, up next, and I am more than ready to get started on it.  Highly recommend this book, it's a great little world to get lost in.",
Truly helpful,Comprehensive and genuinely useful. This is the best book on log I've seen yet.,
Surpriding and original.,I have a great appreciatin for this book and it's perspective on race in the US.  As close to the truth as a story can be.,
Didn't feel a connection with the characters,"This continues the story from Secret Angel, and doesn’t really work as a stand-alone, as there are.a lot of references to the backstory, and there isn’t much history given in this story. It would have.been much better if the two had just been combined into one book...I didn’t feel much of an attachment to any of the characters. They could have more depth, and.the dialogue didn’t really seem like it flowed well either...The whole idea in both stories, of a former rock star moving to a tiny town, in search of a better,.more meaningful life, is a good one. I just felt there was something lacking in the story. It needs.more emotional depth. It is a short, quick read, and I highly recommend that Secret Angel be.prior to reading this one.",
Trash of a President,"He has made millions by telling his lies to the American people, while giving them nothing but despair. Worst President of our times.",
Harassment,"The novel by corporate attorney Chandler Baker titled, Whisper Network, deserves a wide readership. Set inside the legal department of a corporation, the action in the novel revolves around past and present sexual harassment by the company’s General Counsel. Corporate attorneys and human resources managers will take a busman’s holiday with this novel, pleased that their workplace is a much better place for women than the company in this novel. Feminists are likely to feel that Baker speaks their truth with eloquence and explains the ways in which #MeToo gives voice to matters once kept secret. Book clubs are likely to embrace this novel and with wine during conversations, personal stories are likely to be revealed. Any man will benefit from reading this novel especially if it leads to improved listening to women and an enhanced perspective about the lives of women in contemporary society...Rating: Five-star (I love it)",
Surrender trilogy,I just got done reading the 2nd part of this Trilogy and I loved it. I am looking forward to the next series and have my calendar marked as I have it pre-ordered. It was tempting to now buy it from the book store and they had it available before my delivery. But I am glad I waited as the was cheaper on Amazon. I love Maya Banks' stories and always look forward to reading them.,

good siblings story - 1980s vibe,"ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:  An epic party to celebrate the end of summer changes the lives of many...BRIEF REVIEW:  Malibu Rising tells the story of the four Riva siblings: Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit and their parents June and Mick.  Mick was a famous singer who fell in love with June, the daughter of The Costas who owned fish & chips joint in town in 1956.  Through flashbacks we learn much about their rocky relationship and life together how it affected the lives of their four children through the lead up of the big end-of-summer bash on August 27, 1983, that gets out of control and ends in disaster...A love a good family saga and think this one has that feel. This is definitely a character driven story and the author does a great job letting the reader get to know each of the Riva siblings and to and lesser degree, parents June and Mick. I loved the strong sibling ties. By far, Nina was my favorite character, a gorgeous model, fabulous surfer but someone who with a sense of responsibility to others and someone who  put the needs of others above her own. I liked June and Riva's story and that invincible feeling when young and in love that sometimes makes one overlook the obvious. I liked the Malibu beach scene and the 1980s vibes: the sun, the surf, the music and the fancy free lifestyle. My least favorite aspects of this story was the details of the rich and entitled party attendees who seemed to do everything in excess. There was plenty of booze, drugs and sex in this novel as well. Overall I liked this story even though some parts were overdone...This is my second novel by this author, Daisy Jones and the Six was my first and one I enjoyed.  I gather that Mick Riva was one of the husbands in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo but I haven't read that one yet...RATING:  4/5..Thanks go to Random House Audio for allowing me access to this book in exchange for my unbiased review. The audiobook was read by Julia Whelan who did a great job.",
Inspiring,Beautiful images,
"Vandana Singh is the standout, the rest failed to impress","I am a great fan of time travel stories, so this immense tome ought to be right up my alley, but it failed to impress. I'm surprised by the absence of Poul Anderson (either a Time Patrol or anything else); there was not a single story which captured the in-depth historical background he brings to his writing, and far too few which had any emotional resonance. The volume did introduce me to Vandana Singh, however, and I plan to look up more works from her in the future.",
Overview and Introduction,The book skims over the subject matter and only introduces the material enough that an interested student can figure out where to go next for more information.  The language is correct but cumbersome and can not be read quickly.  This seems to be partly due the meat of the subject but also due to many awkward sentences. Acceptable text book.,
Another Awesome Book!,"Darren Shan has added to his masterpiece series with the 9th book, Killers of the Dawn. As always, these gems are far too short!! Shan is such an excellent writer he keeps you wanting more at the end of each book. In this book, young Darren and company, the Hunters, meet up with the Vampaneze Lord in his lair for an all out fight! A few hair-raising moments, some unexpected turns, and an intriguing plot add to this great storyline. A must read for anyone who loves vampires, humor, and and unique writing of Darren Shan!",

"Skip the book, see the movie","I saw the moview 1st, then wanted to know more, so I bought the book. The book is horrible. It is obvious (now) that the screen writer took the best ideas from the book, changed the story, eliminated the garbage and created a great story...The moview is a much better story.",
Survival Guide,"New to the CVICU and ICU in general and this book has been my saving grace while orienting to CVICU. It is easier to understand certain concepts with certain body systems and it has helped clarified information provided by other Nursing ICU/CVICU materials. Would recommend this book for experienced nurses, and maybe new graduates, who need certain concepts broken down a little better, but not in such a way that make it feel simple. The topics explored in this book are heavy and complex but the information is not the bare minimum.",
Easy to understand and fascinating,"""Eric Sloane's Weather Book"" was a very fun, easy-to-understand, and fascinating book about weather. He explained ways that a person can predict the weather by looking at the sky, how to read weather maps--what all the symbols mean--and use weather instruments. He covered information about our atmosphere, air, winds, heat, and clouds, and how it all works together to create weather...The author has a gift for making difficult ideas very easy to understand. He also included many black and white illustrations that reinforced what was taught in the text and made it clear. The book was packed full of practical information on how to become weather-wise. This book was first written some time ago (in 1949) and was based off of articles that the author wrote for sailors and aviators. Most of the information is still completely relevant, but it does show it's age in a few places...I'd highly-recommend this well-written and interesting book to anyone who's curious about how weather is created and how to predict it.",
Awesomeness 👍,Awesome read,👍
You need this,"lots of material in &#34;extra&#34;, you need these cards to systematically sort out at each study session what you know and what you don't know. Easily indexed so you can look up explanations in the ARRL study guide.  Trying and read the study guide front to back...no one has that type of discipline..parts of book need to be read over and over again.. still don't get it? go to Youtube videos...free.  Youtube series by Dave Casler is outstanding..but  not complete coverage of all material, though. These cards are really helpful and there are now 2 errors in them.  One is ARRL exam error on 1/2 vs twice level on atmospheric noise question, other is plain wrong answer selection  on a device's advantage.",
The Dark Monk was Okay,The Dark Monk was a fast read! I thought that it was just okay in comparison to The Hangmans Daughter. It held my interest for the most part but I found some of the plot twists were predictable. I enjoyed reading it since it was a sequel but the book overall fell short of the original.,

Amazing journey through a daughter's need to know her identity,"Though not a daughter of an interracial marriage, having a very diverse cultural family and my parents divorcing with little to no sense of identity through my father (and his family), I couldn't help but identify with the author's journey in finding out more about her father.  Every new clue, twist, and turn kept me wanting to read more and root for the author (and in many ways her father) to learn more in hopes of gaining a better understanding, which ultimately could lead to some closure.  Highly recommend this book; whether for self, a book club, there is so much for discussion and learning.",
Four Stars,Not his best but a good read!!,
Good story teller,Sweet and a bit predictable but I do enjoy the way she writes.,
An Aptly-Named Novel with a Unique Perspective,"THIS COULD HURT is an aptly-named novel.  The setting is a Human Resources department in a New-York-based consumer research corporation, which has gone through several rounds of &#34;down-sizing&#34; due to the economic climate.  The novel opens in late 2009 with another round on the horizon...Rosa Guerrero is the Executive VP/Human Resources Chief who has devoted 15 years of her career to the corporation.  A childless widow, estranged from her siblings, she is approaching retirement, but dreads the loss of her purpose in life and her work &#34;family.&#34;  Rosa has been a stellar leader with the ability to balance corporate goals with human needs.  Consequently, she is well-respected and has engendered loyalty from the CEO and her staff.  In the midst of the looming reorganization, Rosa suffers a health crisis that compromises her mental faculties...The author has captured a cross-section of human nature with the characterization of the staff, ranging from caring to cunning, compassionate to cruel, committed to apathy.  In other words, this is a typically flawed collection of humans forming a sometimes productive, yet dysfunctional work &#34;family.&#34;  The characters are interesting and well-developed, but oddly I didn't seem to form an emotional connection with any of them...My one criticism is that the plotline got bogged down in repetition.  While I started out fully engaged, I found my interest waning as the book progressed due to redundancy among the different chapters highlighting individual staff members.  I did enjoy the author's clever use of organization charts in the Epilogue to highlight the career trajectories of the main characters...Overall, I liked the unique perspective of the novel and would recommend it even with its challenges.",
"Suitable for beginners, most helpful for intermediate users","I'm a beginner at Photoshop, and my partner is good enough that he can generally figure out how to do anything he wants to do with it, but maybe not in the most efficient way possible...As a beginner, I found the book extremely helpful in providing screenshots of the steps involved in each tutorial...The books takes a non-linear approach to teaching, taking you through projects and techniques rather than taking you through each boring beginner thing in sequence. Both of us preferred this way of learning because it kept us engaged and excited about learning the next new thing. Neither of us wanted to skim over parts of this book...I was impressed because it took me from knowing pretty much nothing to feeling about to do a few things in a short amount of time. My partner was thrilled that even after years of using Photoshop, he learned a number of more efficient ways of doing things and some cool new tricks...This book has been in high demand in our home, which says a lot about its usefulness, because we are at very different stages of using Photoshop...I'd recommend it highly. It's easy to understand and laid out in a way that keeps the book fresh and avoids feeling like a boring textbook.",

Stinger and Alice met during a dark time for Alice but from the first moment he laid eyes on her Stinger was stung. Their story is intense and it held me and kept me entertained until the end. Of course there are hot love scenes written by one of the best, but you feel the love these two have for each other in spite of all the dark clouds swirling over them. I enjoyed this book as I do all of Ms. Snow's books. Buy it, read it, and enjoy it. Prairie Devils MC rocks!!",
Five Stars,Love it.,
Review: Siren's Storm,"his is one of those books that I really wish I could give it a higher rating.  I really liked parts of it.  But, there's always that one things that hold it back.  And really, for me a 3 isn't a bad rating.  It's just that I think there are better books out there...I felt like I didn't really connect with Will.  At times, I felt like his character was all over the place.  Granted with the tragedy in his past, I kind of understand.  Especially when you factor in the idea that he has no idea what happened.  He also has a lot on his plate dealing with his best friend, Gretchen.  Her sleepwalking habits often left me agitated.  Her obsession with Asia also felt forced.  She just sort of shows up in town and he can't help but wonder about her.  I also wanted to him to wake up and see what his obsession was doing to Gretchen... I really did enjoy the mermaid/siren folklore in this story.  It includes the story of Calypso, and her obsession with Odysseus.  When he left her, she was overcome with need for revenge.  It was an interesting twist to the story.  I enjoyed Asia's connections with Calypso and what she's required to do...For some reason, I found the overall story extremely slow moving.  It felt like there was hardly any action to drive the story forward.  It wasn't until Asia tells Will the complete story of who and what she is that the story felt like it was going anywhere.  And then it was over.  It left me with some unanswered questions and the thought that there will be a sequel.",
IMPRESSIVE!,What a great collection of short stories!  An impressive roster of authors and a fantastic array of stories!  Don't miss it!,

Very good book !!!!,"Th Hope Factory is a very good book. I feel it accurately depicts life in modern India.My husband travels to that area in India all the time on business and yes the automotive industry and the book accurately reflects what he has seen. The book is very well written and the characters very well developed. The book is about two different families, one the Calvery Auto  factory owner and his quest to obtain more acreage to expand his factory and that of his wife's maid and her struggle to obtain a quality education for her gifted son. It is an interesting story , and very hard to put down . I would recommend you read it if you are at all interested in India it is an excellent story a little rough in a few spots, sex and language if that bothers you.",

The layout is great, the photos gorgeous (I only wish I had the final copy instead of the uncorrected proof)...I see this book as having multiple applications. It would be a fabulous gift for a horse lover. Also sometimes all reluctant readers need is a good non-fiction book to grab their interest. This would definitely fill the bill. Finally I see this book as ideal, too, for use in an ESL classroom. I wish I had 9 copies right now to use in my summer class next week...This is an all-around great book with high interest for the 5th to 7th grade level reader.",

Interesting,"My husband loves to read anything sports or fishing related, so I'm always looking for new books to get him. He isn't a Tebow fan, but was interested in his book. He's open minded and likes to read and draw conclusions from autobiographical books rather than listen to the media. He loathed Mike Leach, until reading his book, and now says he has a great deal of respect for him. Same with the Josh Hamilton book, he said it was very inspiring. He really liked this book by Tebow. He still isn't really on the Tebow bandwagon, but did say he had a very interesting life and it was inspirational. He said people could say what they wanted about Tebow, but the guy just knows how to win. If you're a Tebow fan, absolutely get it, and if you're not, still get it because even if you aren't a fan, you will come to respect him.",
Historical Romance Novel Set In The 1800s,"I loved theme of the novel being set in England in the 1800s with the lead character being a young female, Celeste Ashton, whose is strong, independent, intelligent and curious about the world around her...Celeste lives along the English coast, enjoys being in and around the ocean in general. She encounters dolphins in the cove next to her home and becomes close with them and is able to study dolphin behavior, which then leads Celeste to write a book about her scientific studies of dolphin behavior...The book she writes becomes a success with popular society, but not within the scientific community itself! A professor of ichthyology, named Titus Thorne, spends two weeks to study if what Miss Ashton has written is really true!! He is out to debunk her book as a total hoax...Does he prove her wrong? You'll have to read for yourself! I found this overall plot/storyline was phenomenal and captivating...What I didn't like where some of the minor characters in the novel like Celeste's irritating Nana and her elderly cohorts! There behavior in the novel was annoying at every turn. I didn't like a lot of the other minor characters as well. Plus Professor Titus Thorne seems way too rigid for a man of his age!..Some of the plot details were surprising and fun, while others weren't so great and detracted from the novel itself!",
It is very interesting.,Very interesting.,
Theoretical and dry,Do I need to say more... Very repetitive. Has some good concepts but lot of dry theory. I should have known when the title had such words like Holy Grail and Financial Freedom.,
Great Recipes,"I got this book for my sister who really doesn't like to cook.  But the recipes in this book are so easy that she's told me she refers to it all  the time.  She has a large family so it's perfect for her.  I looked through it and liked it also, so I bought three other books from the Contessa.  I recommend all her books.",
Interesting tale of whodunit,"At first, I didn't think I was going to like this story. It starts with with a dead body and then it gets a bit lost within itself for just a little while. When it picks up though, it really picks up..When Paris Secord, otherwise known as DJ ParSec, is found dead the local music scene is thrown into mourning. Two of her best friends, one before fame, Kya, and one after, Fuse, already completely despise each other but things soon get a lot worse between them. Not only did they both discover the body together they also find themselves in a huge mess when some extremist followers of DJ ParSec decide to take things into their own hands when the police aren't able to do their jobs..I won't tell you more about this because it all happens in stages and phases that you have to read in sequence for it all to come together so perfectly..This story is very well written but there are times when things happen that leave you scratching your head for a bit. However, when it all comes to an end you can look back and see just how good of a story you just read. It's a good little murder mystery thriller type story that is entertaining to see play out to the very end.",
Great toddler book!,My 2 year old fav book! He lovessss it so much!,
This book is a great read.,Good book.,

Great job reading by Jim Dale,"This is a review of the Unabridged Audio CD of book 1.  Amazingly, my review will be number 4594!  I have never seen a book get 1000 reviews..I had never seen the movie or read the book but my 25 year old son told me he feels this book should be required reading in school.  Just got back from driving the family on a vacation and it was fun listening to Jim Dale read this book.  I think this is the same song and dance Jim Dale that played Doc Terminus so wonderfully in Petes Dragon..What a great adventure it was to hear Dale, a veteran broadway actor read this book with the accents and passion with which he delivered the story..This books comes on 7 CDs and covered the drive from Tampa to Biloxi perfectly.  So if you have a 10 hour drive ahead of you, consider obtaining the audio version of this book.",
Red and Digger,I love Rex and Digger... I just wish the stories had a little more action.  The villains are random but Luciana was a fun character that I would want in future books.  Disappointed at the abrupt and partially sad ending but this is a series I enjoy reading.,
Not his best work,Good book but not the best I've read from this author. He may be targeting teens or newbies to the genre. I had hoped this would be as good as Enchantment.,
"Taut, Smart, Dramatic Little Thriller","It's not hard to see why Hitchcock made John Buchan's ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" into a film (which I have not seen).  It's a taut, smart, dramatic little thriller, full of the unlikely events Hitch really grooved on.  I was quite pleased at the end of this breezy novel, which is a pretty obvious source of LeCarre, Fleming, et al.  It's also a marvelous example of fiction incorporating the zeit geist of the era in which it was written...Richard Hannay, late of South Africa, finds himself terribly bored in London, 1914 (which, having been to London, can't possibly imagine), until he meets the mysterious Franklin Scudder.  Allowing Scudder to live in his home, Hannay is astonished by Scudder's bizarre raving tale of an elaborate conspiracy to initiate war among the European powers.  Hannay takes this story with a bit of skeptisism until he comes home one night to find Scudder pinned to the floor by a knife.  Thus begins an elaborate and episodic chase, as Hannay, fully believing Scudder's claims, must run from the police and from the conspiracy, the Black Stone...Buchan is most successful in creating Hannay's elaborate schemes and escapes.  Hannay is a likeable hero, so the reader readily roots for him.  Further, the villains, while never fully developed (it is Hannay's story), make for sinister threats just off-page, so to speak.  The denouement is satisfying, if more than a little tragic...This book is also fascinating because the conspiracy, with changes in detail, basically mirrors the events that ignited World War I.  Various radical interests seek to assassinate a prominent figure (although Princip had no idea of the consequences of assassinating Franz Ferdinand), and trip the various political alliances to start a war.  Thus, Buchan incorporates the weird mixture of patriotism and panic that most historians point to when they chronicle the First World War...The downside of that zeit geist is that Buchan incorporates a certain level of anti-Semitism, some of it being of dubious necessity.  Scudder is convinced that Jews are responsible, because they want Russia to be destroyed by the war.  While we later learn that Scudder had prejudices against Jews, Scudder himself acknowledges the anti-Semitic history of Russia.  Another occasion, Hannay makes an analogy that plays on the stereotypes of Jews as being wealthy.  Again, that is probably an accurate reflection of the times, but it is uncomfortable.  To Buchan's credit, the conspiracy is more than simply an ""evil Jewish plot"" (it's telling that some of the rhetoric Buchan uses is still floating around today)...Nonetheless, as with most older literature, you have to take the prejudices in context of when the book was written.  ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" is not an heir to the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"".  It is an exciting thriller, featuring a heavy does of suspense and intrigue.  Simply put, it's a blast.",
A Literal and Visual Treasure,"Alfred J. Church's Iliad and Odyssey is an exceptional revition of Homer's classic, making it both more accessable to the genre's first time readers, while still delivering a resonance that could easily echo in the halls of ancient Greece. The book is easy to read, which is not to say simplified. The word usage brings an articulation that breaths life to the likes of heros such as Achilles, Hector, Agamemnon, Priam and Odysseus. One feels the facination there must have been listening to the old bard telling of the Trojan War. Like the writting the illustrations are again reminiscent of classic art as well, with sublime lines and minimalist beauty. I read this book as a child and now as an adult, finding this treasure, was like finding an old friend. It is a wonderful book for any collection and a brilliant one to inspire the imagination with great feets and human struggle.",
A great sequel story not to miss.,"This story picked right after the first book and it didn't stop pumping. I liked how much more mature eva is and even though there is still some shyness she is way more courageous. Fury, also a lot bigger and bolder has developed a more solid bond with eva and it's very important because in this story they have to lean on each other for survival and with saying just that, there is more adventure, dangers, new characters and places that the author has added to his story. I Loved every page I turned and if you loved the first you will probably feel the same way with this one as well.",

Lots of suspense and action in a very primitive language,Maybe some people behave like this but they certainly don't talk like this.,
"Great starter bible, but.......","Really good starter bible. However, it's a bit on the fragile side. Be very careful when handling the book cause the pages come out easily. Don't let the toddlers get a hold of it as all. Over than that it's a great book.",
Five Stars,The original story is very good in its own right. I wish it were longer.,
Ava Armstrong is a great author!,"This was my first book by author Ava Armstrong. I am so glad that I tried one of her books! The Dark Horse Guardian series describes the exploits and real life adventures of US Navy SEALS told in a way that shows the bravery as well as the humanity of these special men and their families. Fascinating material! I will now be moving forward to read the rest of this exciting series. Great job, Ava!👍",👍
Excellent,I picked this book because many of my ancestor's names are in it.  I'm very pleased with it.  Its reprint is well-done!,
Love it,"This case is instantly my favorite phone case ever.  I am a soccer fan, a soccer coach , and love to play soccer with my kids.  This case exemplifies the love of the game.  It shows my personality, my passion, and what I care about without saying a word.  It has been an awesome conversation piece every time I take out my case.  All of my soccer friends are jealous and want to know where to get one...In terms of how well the case functions, I am obviously most impressed with the look of the case.  This case provides very decent protection for ever day use.  It has a rubber bumper that surrounds the edges which wraps to the front and around the back of the phone.  The back of the case is a hard plastic that snaps onto the bumper about where the phones glass would be.  All of the buttons on the phone function perfectly.  The openings for the lightning cable, headphones, mic and speakers do not interfere with the function of any of them.  Cords fit without the case needing to be removed.  With phone cases, I think everyone will want different needs met.  My first need was looks with adequate protection.  I wouldn't use this case around the pool or out on the beach but I would use it for most of my every day needs...I received a discount for my honest and unbiased review of this phone case.  For obvious fan reasons, I am more than completely satisfied.  I love this case and it works great.",
3.5-4 stars: Good Overall; One Dud in the Mix,"Traditional Regency anthology. Note: Traditional Regency means no sexytimes (well, except Mary Balogh's - see below)...** ""Under the Kissing Bough"" by Sandra Heath - 2.5-3 stars. Pretty standard Regency fare. Country gentry down on their luck has to move out of their manor home into a cottage. The new owner is a London gentleman who spots one of the daughters when she sneaks onto the estate to collect some greenery to use as Christmas decorations. He takes an immediate interest in her and asks for her help in decorating the manor home for the holidays. Really, no big surprises, no complex characters. Possibly the most interesting character is the villainess, with whom the H, Sir Philip, was once in love...** ""Season of Joy"" by Gayle Buck - 3 stars. Sweet second chance romance/engagement story. A betrothed couple have a misunderstanding when H spots h hugging her longtime MALE best friend before said best friend heads off to the Peninsula to fight in the war. They have a confrontation, and H storms off and decides to join the fighting on the Peninsula, as well (it's not written as hotheaded as it sounds). He writes a letter to h that essentially gives her the okay to jilt him. Instead, she writes him back, and they thus begin a correspondence over the year. Story picks back up when it's Christmas Eve, and H returns to h's family's estate. I would say 3.5-ish, but the last line is definitely a 1-star hokey *cringe*-worthy mess. I know that sounds judgmental, but seriously, when these stories are so short, every paragraph counts...** ""The Viscount and the Hoyden"" by Laura Matthews - 2 stars. I read this story once, years ago. Came away with a bland and blah feeling that henceforth has made me skip this story every year when I bring this anthology out to reread around the holidays. Viscount's mother used to visit somewhere out in the country every year and would come back to tell him stories of this young hoydenish girl. He was enchanted by these tales and envious of her carefree upbringing (he was an only child, if I remember correctly). He visits the country estate with the idea of wooing her. Pretty meh overall. Definitely skippable, in my eyes...** ""The Christmas Mouse"" by Emily Hendrickson - 4 stars. I really really liked this one. It's a sweet story about a young woman who has unexpectedly inherited a country ""cottage."" Only when she goes to the cottage, she sees it's actually an estate. With a manor house. And hundreds of acres of land. And tenant cottages. Oh, and a handsome estate manager by the name of Charles Dane. *wiggles eyebrows*..Amanda, who had up til then been living with her brother and his wife as their unofficial (and unpaid) governess/nanny/tutor/poor relation, has always been retiring in her ways and quite shy around men, so she's quite pleased with the ease with which she can converse and keep company with Mr. Dane. Not only does this story present a sweet wallflower/beta romance, but it also is a bit of a coming of age story as Amanda learns to assert herself a bit and go after what she wants. The central conflict arises when Charlie realizes Amanda is quite an heiress, and he doesn't want her to think he's some kind of fortune hunter...** ""No Room at the Inn"" by Mary Balogh - 3.5 stars. A good story with a cast of characters that are stranded at an inn in a snow/ice/winter storm. A poor couple is also seeking shelter at the inn - in the stables, at that. She's pregnant, and the main action revolves around her going into labor...There are two couples whose romances are featured in this story: (1) an aristocratic married couple on their way to a house party and (2) a rakish marquess on his way to a debaucherous house party and a governess on her way to visit her family. The married couple has been unhappily married for three years, but each loves the other (if only they knew it). He thinks she doesn't need him and is happier with her ton friends than with his own company, while she has tried to be independent all this time because she hasn't wanted to be a burden on him, etc. She knows he keeps a mistress and doesn't understand why he brings his love to another; he keeps said mistress because he doesn't want to subject his wife to his base needs, etc. Basically, false assumptions have nudged them apart over the years until they just can't confront each other or put a finger on what exactly is wrong. I'm not explaining this well, but I really liked this couple. As you'd expect from Mary Balogh, she actually has a love scene in her short story between this couple...it's passionate and emotional. Very well done...What drags this story down is the second couple - the more traditional Regency-type relationship of a rake and a governess. I just found this couple flat out unbelievable. There's too much going on in the narrative for us to get any handle on either of their POVs for why they would fall in love with each other after being stranded together for two days. I think this story would have been much better served if it only focused on the married couple.",
Windows 8.1 for Dummies,"I got this in anticipation of getting a new computer with Windows 8.1. Since I haven't had any exposure to this new system, I thought I might need help. This book lays the ground work for me to get started so that I feel comfortable with setting everything up the way I want it.",
Best Coverstitch reference!,There are not so many books covering the coverstitch machine.  This is really helpful and easy to understand with many illustrations.  This is the best book I've seen.,

The Man Who Flies With Birds.,"I am a Canada Geese fanatic, in fact, I wrote an article about them believing they should run the country! With this fascination, I went to my library to find more information about these magical creatures only to find there were no books on the subject (in my library). The Librarian kindly sent me to other books regarding birds and I found The Man Who Flies With Birds in the children's department. I thought it looked interesting and today, started to read it. I couldn't put it down - not since Harry Potter, another supposedly children's book, has anything grabbed my attention. Exquisite photography indeed and the written words were poetic in their scientific genre (don't you hate that word - just couldn't of another one). I was so entranced that I couldn't stop talking about it to my other half - every time I read a paragraph, I had something else to say. He is not a book reader - more of intelligent magazines and The Irish Times - so it was with some amazement that he agreed to take a look. HOOKED! I am ordering it now from Amazon - where else? - so I can have it in my possession before I return the copy I have to the library. I am not even into aviation, have a phobia about birds but am almost hypnotised by them. I was having a conversation some years ago with a man who was interested in retaining my services for a very prestigious conference when three Bald Eagles flew over the lake where we were discussing the event. For as long as the Eagles were there, I was transfixed. He talked - I didn't hear a word. This is exactly how I felt after the very first page of The Man Who Flies With Birds. Exciting, informative, unique and courageous. Not only that, this book and the work researched, saves lives. It is so topical with recent events of crashes due to birds flying into planes. I am always entranced with creativity and this is beyond the norm. Yossi Leshem is a genius. Whilst writing this, my 'to be' 9 year old grandson is to have his birthday in February so I believe I am to purchase two copies - he isn't getting mine. This is a forever in my library book. I am in my 80th year - obviously this book crosses the age perimetres. So, mind the gap and buy the book. I am going to recommend it to my family in the UK and Ireland. They have Amazon there too. Really, I just can't get over this book. Did I give you that impression? It's sensational - really. Would I lie to the great Amazon public. Dr. Yvonne Kaye.",
What's not to like?,"The art is precious, it is fun to read, and the cake recipe is easy and delicious.  My five year old loves this book, and we finally got around to baking and eating the cake recently.  Yum!",

funny cat,all good,
Smaller than expected,"The book is nice but for the price point, I assumed the book would be a regular size. It's more like a pocket size but it's ok. It still looks pretty",
Great book!,Great book! Quick ship,
Everything I want in an ice cream recipe,"I took advantage of this book being on sale for such a great price after a friend recommended it. With flavors like Bangkok Peanut (peanut butter, coconut, cayenne...) and Roasted Strawberry, I was in. I really like that these recipes don't call for raw eggs like so many ice cream recipes do. Also, the author is very good about telling you where/how to find any unfamiliar ingredients. There is also a great amount of information given about the ingredients, suggestions for brands/sources, and what they contribute to each recipe...If I have to come up with one negative thing about it, it's that sometimes you have to do a bit of flipping around. For example, it'll say to add something, and see the technique for doing that on another recipe, instead of maybe putting it in the appendix with the other techniques. Other than that, I am truly satisfied with this purchase...I'd like to point out that most of the negative reviews seem to be from people who failed to actually READ the book. Yes, most of the recipes call for corn syrup - and the author specifically says that this does NOT mean High Fructose Corn Syrup. If you have a corn allergy or whatever, she also says that tapioca syrup works too, and you can order that on Amazon or find it in Whole Foods. Also, YES, many of these recipes are non-traditional. If you order the book from Amazon and fail to take the opportunity to look at the index, it's not the book's fault that you don't like the recipes in it. There are the traditional chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, etc., but if that's all you want, why are you buying a cookbook?..I'm really hoping I can make it out to Columbus to visit one of her shops!",
One of the best kids books out there,"I first encountered this book at a reading at my local library - it was such a hit that the kids demanded the librarian read it over and over again until she finally had to tell them 'no more'.  The story is simple and sweet and really encourages my 2 daughters to try and read (my oldest, 2 1/2) spells the names of the colors.  It's also a fun book to read, it incorporates rhyme and song, and you Pete's happy, hippy attitude is hard to resist.  Buy this book!",
Story is pretty basic but illustrations are delightful.,"Nothing new or ground-breaking here, just a sweet little story about a shy little squirrel making new friends by attending a party. There are parts which may strike you as a bit clunky and odd-sounding, and I suspect that this might have flowed a bit more smoothly in the original French. For example:.. &#34;..Ant asked the seagull what the vast emptiness of sea and sky was like (Because it's so mysterious...this emptiness!)&#34; Your preschooler won't be the only one puzzled by phrases like that...In addition, much is made of the mysterious 'nothing tart'  which will be served at the party. Ant asks Harry the bear will there be a tart? What sort? Harry says it will be a 'nothing tart'. Next page: ant's mouth waters just thinking about the 'mysterious' nothing tart. Next page: Harry is &#34;still thinking about the nothing tart&#34;. He tells George the owl that &#34;the evening would be absolutely unforgettable because of the wonderful nothing tart.&#34; Next page: George wonders what sort of costume goes with a nothing tart. Several pages later, at the party, ant is speaking &#34;between bites of nothing tart.&#34; That's it. Never mentioned again. Was that supposed to be funny? I don't get it...The best thing about this book is the illustrations, very brightly colored and done in a retro early-1960s style. An extra star just for those. Since Amazon doesn't have &#34;see inside&#34; for this book, I'm including some pics.",
Five Stars,Great Book!,
Again a good story but.... Proofreading abdominal!!,"I noted this in my other review and must now do the same for the last few books. Great story, but a lack of proofreading plagues the book and at least for me it stops me cold and takes me right out of the story and back to reality.",
Five Stars,Great book!,
You MUST read this book,I LOVE this book. I discovered it after doing a devotional on my YouVersion app based on this book. Highly recommend for anyone that can be prone to toxic thoughts. The author explains things in such an easy to understand but powerful way. The quality of the book is great and it shipped quickly!,
This is a very good book,I liked this book because it teaches kids that even when you dislike one of your siblings you will still love them because they are your family.,
Entertaining,"Great, entertaining puzzle book. Wife and I completed it in a day with a few hints but definitely worth the price. Can't wait to get the sequel.",
Informative book,"Examples of research studies, statistics to help patients understand risks, information on dosages and best medications to use for different populations.  Excellent seller, speedy delivery.",
Love it!,This book taught me what two others could not!,
Georgeous,"I love this book nothing like the paper dolls were back in my day, this one is so pretty with glitter on the clothes.  The only thing is that all have to carefully cut out so a grown up may need to help.  You have 6 dolls and can use the skin tone like your self, white or dark and they all just as beautiful as the next.  The little flower girl and ring barrier are so cute.  The brides have a lot of different changes of her wardrobe.  I just love this and it bring back so many memories as when I was a little girl. Wish you could click on the pages of the book and see the details.  Going to play with these with my great-granddaughter we will have a ball.  Thanks to. Tracy McDonald, Customer Care Specialist of Dover Publications.com for sending me this book for my honest review.",
It was ok,"It was ok, but I expected more",
Absolutely soulful!,"What a soulful book.  I laughed.  I cried.  And I learned some philosophy from a dog.  Yes, a dog...I have to admit, when I realized that the main character in the book was Enzo the dog, and that it all takes place from his point of view, I wondered if the story would really maintain my interest.  I needn’t have worried.  It did!..Enzo is a philosopher with a worldview shaped by lots of TV, movies about car racing and the love and protection of his owner, Denny.  (The love and protection is definitely reciprocated!)  Enzo is both naïve and wise and hoping in his next life to be a human with the ability to speak and to use opposable thumbs.  After living inside Enzo’s head, I think he’s ready.  I think he should graduate.  He’d be a human I’d like to know...There were so many quotable quotes in this book, so many bits of philosophy that I just loved.  Here’s one of my favorites:..“But my thoughts turned to what [Denny] had just taught me.  Such a simple concept, yet so true:  that which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our destiny.  Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.”..I’m torn with whether to call this book a pleasant read.  I somehow don’t think “pleasant” applies as there are some really tough times that Denny and Enzo go through.  On the other hand, as I finished the book and tried to think what to say about it, I was steeped in satisfaction with the arc of the story and I will miss Enzo.  I want to drop my hand toward the floor and feel him nuzzle it.  So maybe pleasant is the right word...Kudos to the author for making me care so much about the “people” in this story – and yes, I include Enzo in that term.  I recommend this book to anybody who wants to see the world through the big brown eyes of simplicity and love.",
Not just a Thanksgiving goodie,"While I ordered this for Thanksgiving, it is certainly a lesson for any time of the year, and, for many ages! Loved it. So did my grandsons.",
It is supposed to be great  But...,I do not know.. I am having a hard time with the narrator's pace and her voice . After the first part just  to be fair I started over .  I'm giving it another chance and going back to beginning ..  Still not sure if I'm wasting my time.  I read and write a lot  But at this point I'm going to say  not so good so far .and give it up.,
Great book for kids!,"We got this book after first buying &#34;Falling for Rapunzel&#34;. They are so cute and witty, they're even fun for us to read to the kids so bedtime stories aren't quite as tedious.",
These books are so well worth the money,"I want to own the whole lot of them.  They are well thought out and of high quality in both content and production.  My 11 year old son has learned more about Einstein than most people from reading the 30 second Theories book.  Wonderful, every household should have a set!",
So much better than using junk mail for bookmarks!,"I decided my books deserved something better. These booklets of bookmarks do the trick. They are inexpensive, pretty and have good vibes. They also make nice gifts.",
Book,Excellent Product. #####,
An alright read,"I have never read Rob Thurman before, and after reading this book, I'm not really sure if I'll be reading anything else by her. I would say that this book is about a 3.5, it was a good read, definitely plenty of action and excitement, it just wasn't anything spectacular. This book sorta read like an overly packed action movie. Jackson is a guy with a loaded and trouble past which has left him bitter, scorned and resentful. But that is all there is to him. That's it. I can see the hurt from his past, and yes his snarky comments made me laugh half of the time, but the other half they just annoyed me. The rest of the characters really didn't make an impression on me either. They all felt two dimensional. Yes this book had good plot, but without a strong build of characters your story really falls flat. I will say that I was surprised at the end and the mystery of the killer was not someone that I would have chose, but maybe if I thought hard about it it would seem obvious...anyway, maybe next time I read one of her books I'll loan it from the library..",
Quick Read,Very nice book. I’m always interested in anything Everest or the surrounding area. I’ll have to try some of his other books!,
"Yummy, but NOT fast!","I've enjoyed everything I've made from this cookbook. The recipes are full of spices and fresh herbs and I have to say, they're really good. But they definitely aren't fast. And not cheap either. My grocery bill was really high when I cooked dinners from this cookbook exclusively. Now I cook one or two meals from this book each week, and it's much more reasonable for my wallet and my time. They are good recipes though! And I learned a few tricks in the front section that I always use, like roasting nuts before putting them in a recipe. Yummy!",
Lourdes is super!,"This is the perfect book for children who have parents from Central or South America and North America.  It is so effective in showing them why they are so special to be children whose parents come from different ""worlds"".",
Good not great,"I was worried at the start that this would be too YA for me but despite it's YA moments (AKA ""mom loves Johnny more"") it's a very interesting book.  Describing how life changes as the world comes to an end through a journal really brought the story home.  It seemed a bit strange that everyone was taking it so well at the beginning and even days after it happened there wasn't mass panic.  That seemed a bit unrealistic to me but otherwise I think it was a very good tale.  The rest of the books might not at the top of my ""to read"" list but the rest of they are definitely on it!",
Great First Reader!,This book will always have a place in my heart as it is the 1st book I learned to read by myself!.Am so glad it is in print to share with my grandchildren as they are learning to read!,
There are many better 'art history' books.,"""The History of Art"" by Janson Used by Rice U. (cheap used). ""Art History"" by Gardner used by S.F.Art inst. either one is 100 times better. Bought this looking for something new/inspiration. It is okay, not any full page color plates. It was not inspirational.",
Great product good quality,Great product good quality,
Oh wow!,"I'll admit, I don't remember Hunter in either of Vaughn's or Knight's books. But that's ok. Sorta as there was one point I really wish I remembered...Ok. So! I hated him for like the first 20+% I'm not a fan of man-whores. His only redeeming factor was that at least he made sure his ladies were satisfied. A selfish man-whore will get me to DNF...BUT THEN..... Sailor and her strong self made me love him so much. SO SO SO much...I highlighted more parts of this book (14) then any other book I've ever read. Not just a sentence or two, sometimes whole paragraphs...At about 79% I just couldn't put it down. We have a no electronics rule at the dinner table and I about BROKE that rule. I don't think I've ever eaten so fast so that I could get back to my book...Did an audible listen. I just can't get enough of Hunter. The wait for the next book(s) is killing me. Jason Clarke did not disappoint. Though Virginia Rosa sounded to old to be Sailor. In the beginning it was hard to listen to, but by the end it became normal. Yet still she sounded to old. I swear Jason Clarke could easily 'cat fish' everyone with the way he can change his voice. AMAZING.",+
Good book,Read it again and again.,
Another awesome book! A must buy!,"To be honest I just got the book today. Somehow I got the book early at a Christian bookstore. I don't know how but I thank God for providing. I have not read this book, but instead have glanced through it and as well read pieces of the books. I must say it is as good as Vintage Jesus in giving us a practical but deep Biblical understanding into matter. This book goes through how to be a loving church, to being a missional church. If you got Church Leadership by Mark and you liked it. You are going to love this book. It takes that book and expounds greatly into things and adds new things that anyone who has a passion for the church and church planting would and should devour. This is a great book and I can't wait to read this thing cover to cover...Plus if Mark Driscoll is reading this thanks for letting God use you.",
Good purchase,A favorite in our house.,

Fun story,I don’t usually read romance novels but did enjoy this. The mystery part of the story was well written. I didn’t expect the culprits till almost the end. Fun read.,
"Convoluted, murky story with stilted writing","I could only read half of the book.  When she spent a very long chapter on the back story of a casual acquaintance of the grandfather of the protagonist, I felt the author was undisciplined in controlling her story.  Yes, there are flashes of eloquent prose.  But the story is herky jerky and she gets sidelined and off on a tangent far too frequently.  As she matures as an author I expect this problem to dissipate.  But this book is just a poor first attempt by a budding young author.",
One Star,"Horrible, Blasphemous, Filthy, and Disgusting. DO NOT BUY!!!",
Fascinating character and engaging story,"I really enjoyed this audio book. The narrator is excellent. The story is easy to stay engaged in and follow. I found the character fascinating and the tie in to many characters that are canon, to be well integrated...I wish this book was canonized and that if Disney decides to add to this character, that they consider using this book as a good reference and try to incorporate as much of this into canon as possible.",
Way underpriced for how cute it is!!,This was so cheap so I didn’t have high expectations but it’s AMAZING! The stickers can be removed and replaced without tearing or tearing the pages of the book. My 3 and 6 year olds have had an absolute blast with these and they actually create beautiful pictures! Great for long car rides!,
Love this book!,I have had to buy this twice..loaned it out and people love it and kept it. I have a close eye on it now. When my son was younger he was a not-strickly vegetarian..at 23 he still eats that way. This book was a go to book then and still is now.,
Great toy!,My kids really liked it and played with it for hours.,
I got this from the library Girls would really enjoy it,"I got this from the library Girls would really enjoy it &amp; it's a good resource for youth leaders &amp; teachers (a good tie in for social studies)..Contents include:  a quill pen  *  berry ink  * walnut ink  * wax seal  *  game of graces  * cup &amp; ball  *  kite  * folding fan  *  fancy strawberry hat  *  cross stitch sampler  *  sachet  *  friendship pincushion  *  tussi mussie  * pomander ball...The only things I thought were missing were jewelry crafts: seed jewelry, dried flower jewelry &amp; paper bead jewelry (I have my great-great grandmother's paper bead &amp; seed bead  necklace she made from left over wall paper) - these were common crafts, especially for young girls of the time to make as &quot;real&quot; jewelry was considered inappropriate for girls to wear..If you want to know if this book is for you, go to your local library. If they don't have a copy there is always the option of the Inter-Library Loan procedure (books usually take about 3 weeks to arrive). I almost always preview books from the library before purchasing ... it has saved a lot of disappointment",
An Almost Excellent Boston Guide!,"The Frommers's Guide to Boston and it's surrounding area is quite useful, informational, and ideal for those coming to Boston for the first time or hundredth time. Boston is very historic, enlightening, and a worldly city. The book is done well but it can be done better for those of us who would like to know Boston and it's neighborhood...Boston has attracted all kinds of people like Julia Child who is missing from the text. She was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I wished that she was written more about here. She remained in Cambridge for decades even with the success of her shows and books. Cambridge has also attracted actor John Malkovich as well in recent years as well as other famous and notable residents. In Julia's book, she decided with her husband to settle in Cambridge after they returned from Europe. I wished the book would have acknowledged Julia Child's contributions to American cuisine, television history, and American culture...I also wished the book mentioned Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts as well but it doesn't. There are lot of important facts and information about Boston that isn't here. I loved the film section about what films in recent years especially ""The Fighter"" in Lowell and other notable films...I liked the book's acknowledgement of cemeteries where famous Americans such as Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and others have been interred. Boston is about American history as well as about sports. I visited Boston when Ted William died around 4th of July and he was honored with the flag at half staff at the Capital building. He was an American baseball legend and a beloved Boston Red Sox player...We stayed at a Doubletree hotel near JFK/Massachusetts General area. The book is almost excellent and could use some constructive and positive criticism. I also think the book could have done more on Cape Cod for day trips. Still, you won't be disappointed with this guidebook.",

Wonderful Novel for a 13 Year Old,"This is a wonderful novel.  I am giving it to my godchild, who is turning 13 this year..I read this novel years ago and recently reacquainted myself with it.  I taught 5th grade for many years and this novel was a favorite in many of my classes.  I would use it during “read aloud” time in my classes.  The language was a bit advanced for my students, but they became wrapped up in the story and a lot of them checked out the novel from our library to read it after we finished it as a class.  There is something about a good book that makes you want to re-visit it again!",
Five Stars,Perfect.,
Passed the test,This book helped a lot and was very easy to read. Memorizing the ports from one of the tables helped answer at least 4 of the questions on the security+ exam. Only thing not in the book were the simulation questions. I think I got most of them right with the information provided from this book,+
Familiar places,"Mr. Gaines writes aboout places and people who my family readily recognizes. We are first generation Californians and our family base is in Louisiana. All the places,faces and social situations are so familiar that  in my lit class I was able to answer questions from other students.  This  book is wonderful reading. If you want a sense of Louisiana without the  travel time, read anything written by Ernest Gaines.",
... of the 39 Clue books are very exciting and wonderful to read,All of the 39 Clue books are very exciting and wonderful to read.  I started my nephews on them and I have read each and every one right along with them and they are great!,
GORGEOUS,I love this book and this illustrated version fills my heart with happiness!,
This one pays beautiful homage to the Alice Network.,"What I Didn’t Like:.-Charlie’s chapters. They felt almost repetitive and unnecessarily fluffy. I suppose they exist mostly to break up the heaviness of the topics addressed in the rest of the book, which is important, but they just don’t give the same sense of urgency and excitement as Eve’s chapters..-The math “equations” forced on everything. As an actual math geek myself, I can say it’s incredibly unlikely you’ll find us making statements like “me plus him minus morals equals …”. We tend to feel operations have weight and value, meaning we’re less likely to throw them around in ways they weren’t intended for. But maybe that’s just me. Either way, it annoyed me that Charlie kept doing this..-The ending. If you’ve been following my reviews for a while you know I’m the kind of reader who likes endings that don’t lay it all out for me and instead keep me thinking and guessing long after I finish the book. I realize I’m in the minority there. That being said, this final chapter (epilogue) felt unnecessary to me...What I Did Like:.-The historical research involved in this one added a wonderful sense of accuracy that this tale needed. The Alice network was real. Many of the women mentioned are based on real people and their real stories. This was an excellent retelling of their challenge, specifically Eve’s chapters. This is 100% of the reason this book is recommended by so many people and passed around so frequently. It’s an important part of history well researched and embedded..-High tension. Eve’s chapters ran with an intense sense of urgency that kept my interest and kept the story moving. I felt myself pulled to continue reading just to find out what happened next. She was captivating and compelling right from the first scene she popped into..-The romance side storyline worked. I don’t always say that and I definitely don’t think it was entirely necessary (not every story needs a romance) but this one works. It’s believable and it works for this story...Who Should Read This One:.-Historical fiction fans, specifically those who want something different from WWI or WWII fiction that already exists. This emphasis on the Alice Network makes this one refreshingly different from the rest of the offerings out there...My Rating: 4 Stars.Solidly researched historical fiction makes me happy.",
Doreen Virtue-Assertiveness for Earth Angels,Great book on how to live a better life as a Earth Angel..Doreen is a very insightful teacher in understanding Angels and their place in this physical world...A good read for anyone interested in this subject.,

To the Land of No Homes,"Yes, that title is symbolic. This short novel can be read in a sitting. It takes a mock-medieval style to report, from alternating and eventually contrasting narrative voices, what happened on an episcopal mission commanded by the Pope to reclaim the Norse lapsed into heathenry in faraway Greenland...It's more of a conceit than a full-fledged work. Hester Velmans' translation may capture the starched, satirical, and savage qualities of the original French, but the effort feels fussy and overly stylized in English. So does the effort to which the author strains to capture the tone of a chronicle or correspondence, given the friction of the attempt to counter the wiles of the Inuit, here titled &#34;publicans,&#34; who lure the dwindling Norse into their seal-hunting, sexually suspect and sinful mores...A few good lines show the potential. Early on, frostbite claims victims on the bishop's ship. Having been forbidden to eat their own rotting flesh to survive, one shipmate rebels. &#34;One of them replied that the season was not Lent, and proceeded to devour his own toes.&#34; I admit I liked some of the dour and deadpan recitals of increasing woe, as the rescue attempt to scare and shame the Norse back to Christian fidelity, compared to the odd temptations of dissolute abandon among the natives, lure the Catholic contingent into their compromises, to survive in New Thule increasingly hostile threats.",

"Interesting historical setting, mildly intriguing characters","I'm always eager to find new historical mysteries, and especially series of same; but I'm not sure whether I'll read the next two books in this series (or however many have been translated so far)...I suspect that part of my problem lies with the translation, though there's no obvious problem with it. There's something about the progression from scene to scene that didn't quite work for me. I also found it very difficult to keep the characters straight -- even though the names of Danes, Saxons, and Vikings presumably had different origins, they were mostly unfamiliar (or only slightly familiar) and largely composed of vowels. . . ...I didn't dislike the narrator, but I did find his preoccupation with nubile young women a bit annoying at times. His sometimes deadly pragmatism did intrigue me, and I mostly enjoyed his sense of humor. As for Winston, the illuminator turned detective: I liked the idea that a habit of close attention to detail could be transferred from artistic to other uses, but there was something that didn't quite work for me about his transitions from one hypothesis to another...I did appreciate the chance to learn a little about an era in English history with which I was almost entirely unfamiliar. If I return to this series, that'll probably be why.",
Love,Love Laurell K. Hamilton,
Intercultural communication - the book,"This fantastic work is pretty much cross-cultural communication: the book. The beautiful (and beautifully illustrated/designed) story follows a bird and fish from intial cultural collision to eventual intercultural communication, highlighting both the adventures and the adversities that such explorers encounter.  I'm using this with my ESOL students - an absolutely beautiful book.",
Fun and easy read for adults.,"This book was a great read.  It’s something you can choose to read a chapter at a time if you’re in a hurry (no major cliffhangers at the end of every chapter), or something that will keep you engulfed if you are wanting to read a book over a relaxing weekend.  There were times I could relate to the character, and that made me more emotionally connected to him.  My only warning to future potential  readers, is if you don’t like fowl language, or knowing what goes on in every man’s head (hint: sex), then you may want to steer clear of the book.  But if your looking to read a fun, quirky, relatable book, this is a good choice.",
Review,"I loved it, the book had enough suspense and mystery to keep me glued to the page.  Just as Bill Rogers previous series with DCI Tom Canton was really good, I believe this new series will be just as good, if not better.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.",
its ok,I don't know was very slow going and not a lot of paranormal its more of a story of a woman dealing with life after a bad breakup becoming her own person,
Great eBook!,Great formatting - fits the page on my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 tablet.  Text is sharp and scanned etchings are clear and impressive.  It was quite the enjoyable experience reading this version of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.,
great book,wish I have ordered it sooner. great for first time parents. It's hard cover which mean it will last a long time. Book is carefully categorized by age so easy to navigate to where I want to read (my son is 13 month old).,
nice reference material,still have it in my library as a go to if dont understand whats on screen or in novels,
Amazing read!,Amazing read! Captivated my mind. WARNING....don't read before bedtime or else you'll have insomnia! You won't put the book down so you'll stay up trying to read it...lol,
Five Stars,Mmmmm good,
Dirty Truth,This is the second book in the Irish Mafia series - it is a standalone but a highly recommend reading the first book Dirty Liar.  I think you get a better appreciation for this one after you've read the first.  Plus you get to fall in love with both Flynn brothers.  One on the wrong side of the law and one straight-laced lawyer.  But family is family and when you are called to step in you just do it.,
A Great Arm chair adventure.,Really enjoyed this first novel.  A page turner.  A nice adventure without leaving the house.  So many familiar names and places for anyone who lives near or enjoys traveling to and around Western North Carolina and the Great Smokies,
4 year old loves it,"My 4 year old really loves this book he laughs at the pigeon, however my 3 year old doesn’t care for it much maybe because he’s a tad bit younger. This is my 4 year olds favorite book",
Best cookbook I own!,"This is the ""Joy of Cooking"" for the next generation-not only does it give you the best way to make just about everything, it also provides variations and for those of you who are interested in the ""how"" of calling something the best recipe, it goes into wonderful detail of the process! Great technique descriptions and delicious recipes that are almost guaranteed to turn out perfectly-I highly recommend this book!",
Good Product,"This book was in good shape, no problems.",
Excellent Addition,This was an extra book I purchased for my class.  it was a great addition to my class books.,

The First Three Great Books in a Great Series,"Chase - What happens when two young lovers who were torn apart are thrown back together after ten long years?  This is a great book about 2nd chance romance and what ""can be"" when obstacles are overcome...Abe - What a pleasant surprise this book was!  I instantly fell in love with Abe and all his little quirks.  Boy do the ""big ones"" fall hard when they meet ""the one"" and it turns out, Mercy was Abe's perfect ""one""...Torin -  I was glad to finally get to read Torin's story and I was very pleasantly surprised because I had totally built up a different man and story from what actually happened.  I loved this book and was so glad Torin got his HEA because of all the Savage Kings, I believe he deserved to have one.  The character of Lexi turned out to be another pleasant surprise and the chemistry between her and Torin was fantastic.  Again, I had a different image of how it would be when these two finally met and boy did Lane Hart come through with a fantastic storyline.",

"Ridiculous, Frustrating, Worth Reading!","Yet another good, and quick read.  The Jack Reacher series continues to be entertain, even though his powers of deduction are borderline ridiculous, and his secrecy is frustrating.  This story is a little different from the previous 4, and the time line is a little cloudy (amount of time passing during drives and so forth), it's still worth reading.",
Fun Rhyming Book,"This is a colorful, rhyming book.  Llama Llama doesn't want to start school.  He doesn't want to play with the other children or eat the snack.  A big tear runs down his face when he thinks of his sweet Llama Mama.  His zebra teacher tells him she's coming soon.  When Mama finally arrives, she and Llama Llama joints him on the playground.  You sense Llama Llama is going to be happier about going back to school the next day because now he knows Mama won't forget to pick him up.  Good book for preschool, day care, nursery or kindergarten students.",
Great book,"Note: this is a new adult book and it deals with mature themes such as rape, and explicit sex...Going Under is beautifully written. I was really moved by the writing in this book. S. Walden did an amazing job evoking emotion with her writing. Brooke is such a strong young lady. Even though some of the things she did were pretty dangerous and I wouldn't recommend her course of action, I completely understand why she felt like she needed to. I can't even imagine losing my best friend the way she lost hers. This book is about her journey really. Sure, there is also the ""secret club of jerks"" storyline that she is trying to get to the bottom to, but for me it was much more about justice for Beth and closure for Brooke...Brooke is completely weighed down by her guilt for most of the book. She feels responsible for her best friends death because of certain things that happened before her death. But no one else blames Brooke. She only blames herself. And because of this guilt she hatches a plan to avenge Beth. And she spends most of the book figuring out a way to do it. Along the way, she meets Ryan and they seemed like magnets. They were instantly drawn to each other. Even though they both tried to keep their distance, they just couldn't stay away for long. But Ryan and Brooke each had their own secrets. (just like everyone else at the school, it seemed). There were a few twists and turns and theories thrown around at various points in the story but I thought it was pretty clear what was really going on. There wasn't too much mystery surrounding the secret club, but I still loved the way the story flowed...Nothing felt forced, or rushed. The writing was descriptive and beautiful really. Going Under is a very powerful book. The strength that you see in Brooke is beautiful. She is someone that you are rooting for the whole time. I just loved her. Going under deals with some pretty mature and dark themes and there is some graphic scenes but it is just a great book. One that I would re-read for sure...*Disclaimer- I received a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review. I was not compensated for my thoughts.",

Styles that fit Regency but can be worn today, even the knickers, and with stitches that are mostly in the easy to intermediate range, a wide variety from dresses and sweaters and jackets to chokers and kids wear.

Of course, any  Load Data  would be obsolete.  New manuals for newer powders.  Page after page, I.was treated to basics, as well as very fine detail, regarding this hobby.  He also describes some aspects, of factory ammunition production.  And many historical aspects of handloading.  Bottom line, U can not go wrong ordering this book.",

Excellent Book I Couldn't Put Down!!,Fantastic read!!  Full of characters who could be the bad guy.  I enjoyed the fast pace full of twists and turns galore.  Kate White writes a great book!,
One of my favorite reads this year,"4.5 stars.I thought this book was a breath of fresh air as it's not the type of story I necessarily get to read very often. In some ways it is such a simple story but because the characters are complex as is their relationship, it just somehow works in an absolutely beautiful way.  I'm left feeling like this was just one of those good, rewarding reading experiences that only happens every once in awhile...Connell is smart, popular, and a football star at his high school.  Marianne is also smart but doesn't have any friends at school and gets picked on for her appearance as well as being labeled a mental case. Connell's mother cleans houses for a living and Marianne's family is one of her clients.  Connell often picks his mom up from work and that is how he gets to know Marianne better and develop an interesting connection to her.  But he definitely doesn't want the kids at school to know he has feelings for the outcast so he doesn't acknowledge Marianne at school or any other time except when they are alone.  And Marianne is okay with this.  The story alternates between the perspectives of Connell and Marianne and follows them over the course of a few years...Fair warning, Sally Rooney does not use quotation marks in her writing so if you think that might bother you when reading dialogue, maybe give this book a pass.  Personally, even though I don't see this writing technique used very often, it doesn't take me very long to adjust and get used to it...I read the author's other book, Conversations with Friends, a few years ago and enjoyed it but I liked this one even more.  Part of that can be due to the fact the characters in this book were far more likable, especially Marianne.  She is somebody who you wanted to be happy and you hurt when she hurt.  There is just something about these characters and their relationship that just spoke to me.  I really can't put it into words...I do recommend checking this one out but I will freely admit it's the type of book that you will either think is special or you will be left wondering why was there was so much hype.  As readers we bring our life experiences into every book we read so it makes sense we might not all gravitate towards the same stories. I personally loved this one though and am thankful I read it. Looking forward to reading more books by this author in the future.",

Good Intro Into Science and Belief!,"Great quality book, easy, short little read, with a good intro between science and faith!",
From a Gliderman's Viewpoint,"There are not many ""first-hand accounts"" of the glider troopers in World War II but Fighting With The Screaming Eagles goes a long way to fill that void...Robert Bowen has as easy, natural style, which brings to light many of the unique challenges facing the glider forces.  First, they were not volunteers but were expected to perform at the same high combat level as paratroopers.  And that they did!..Second, they were delivered into combat in light, vulnerable, plywood gliders in a controlled crash landing that was considerably more dangerous than a parachute jump.  They didn't receive their special insignia and hazardous duty pay until July 1944...Bowen pulls no punches as he takes the reader through the rough training, the Atlantic crossing and how the 401st stubbornly clung to its unit identity after being assigned as the 1st Battalion of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR) of the 101st Airborne Division.  From there, his unit was in reserve to the 4th Infantry Division coming ashore on Utah Beach and the harrowing glider landings in Operation Market-Garden before being rushed to the Ardennes on the battle of the Bulge where Bowen was captured...His unique perspective as both a glider warrior and a POW make this book extremely interesting and informative.  Pictures, maps, a robust bibliography and a Roll of Honor for Company C, 401st round out this extraordinary book...Anyone interested in airborne operations in Word War II will love this book...John E. Nevola.Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II",

A must have for elementary teachers in the lower grades!,"I borrowed this book from a fellow teacher to use the Write Your Own Fairy Tale section (Once Upon a Time) and quickly realized that this book is full of great lessons and writing practice that students truly enjoy. After using it for numerous activities and assignments in my classroom, I decided that I better buy my own copy before I wore hers out! The book's lessons are definitely directed at the lower elementary grades but if you use the basic ideas and incorporate it with your grade curriculum it can easily be used in all of the elementary grades. I highly recommend this book to all elementary teachers!",

Very interesting book,What a tragic end for a young woman who was born to wealth and loving maladjusted parents. Wasted lives and wasted wealth.,
Big doesn't mean Good!,"Quite dissappointed by the songs, since it introduces very early the high E note, which in my opinion is the hardest for elementary kids to execute properly. However, it sticks to the 78 songs with only six notes promise. The price printed on the face of the book says $7.95. At least erase it or cover it before advertising its $9.99 price as a great deal!!",$$

Good Read,We really enjoyed this book but a friend told me it reminded her of a story that had come out years before.,
Enjoyable enough,"*Warning: spoilers*..I am sad to say that I believe this is the weakest of the Redwall series.  It's not a matter of a familiar plot, but the weakness of the characters, the occasional overly-convenient event, and repetitive descriptions.  The Redwall elders are unusually harsh, particularly in the beginning of the book.  Their characters seem very flat, and any changes in their actions don't seem believable.  While I can accept the most overly-convenient events in a story I'm already suspending disbelief for, the badgers Salixa and Tabura came out of nowhere to fix Gorath's Bloodwrath.  Salixa in particular was ridiculously two-dimensional.  She was described as &#34;slender&#34; and &#34;gentle&#34; far too often to not be repetitive.  I felt like I'd fallen into a random love story that just happened to have an adventure and badgers...I enjoyed the book, and I certainly wouldn't steer younger or dedicated readers away from Eulalia.  The plot was a typical, interesting adventure.  It has its fun characters.  I specifically enjoyed Maudie.  It's an enjoyable story.  The writing just wasn't up to Jacques' normal standard.",

Like a gothic Alice in Wonderland,"Take a weak man whose life is pretty much in the control of the other people in his life, then throw him through the proverbial rabbit hole and into a ""through the looking glass"" version of the London tube system. Put his life in constant peril where he must use what wits he has about him to form alliances among a series of intrigues, the depth of which are wholly outside his grasp. This is the story of an unlikely protagonist, Richard Mayhew, who, like Alice in the Looking Glass, has to see an unfamiliar world with new eyes to survive the constant dangers that threaten him...In my opinion, this is one of the best books of the past two decades. The number of copies I have lost through loaning them out would support this opinion.",

Disappointing,"This book struck me as very superficial. The author attempts to cover a very wide spectrum and, as a result, detail is sorely lacking. One example will suffice. The author describes the purpose of kudzu, ending with &quot;[I]f you like, you can also start kudzu while Red Hat Linux is running&quot; --- and fails to tell you how to start kudzu. Excuse me, but what's the point of failing to provide basic information?.The index is also very weak.On the whole, I think one can do much better than this book..Jerry",

"Good ideas but boring, stale and juvenile writing style","I love the idea of this story and the setup but the dialogue is so stilted and dry.  There is also a tendency for the author to avoid contractions and write ""we are"" ""it is"" ""we will"" etc. It ruins the flow of a writing style that should be light and relatable...I have never read anything else by this author but it almost feels like this was passed off to a mediocre ghostwriter of some sort. There is just something incredibly dry and robotic about the way it's written.",
Another entertaining mystery by Wade.,"Consistently good writing from this author. I was not surprised by the ending, but I seldom am surprised, as a result of reading so many mysteries for almost 60 years. At least I am not offended by this author's skill, intelligence and creative abilities. I enjoy his characters and dry humor, too.",
I liked it,"From the back cover:..To Liane, marriage was total commitment. She'd been devastated to learn of her husband's casual infidelities. And that was why, after two years of marriage, Liane had left Julian Wilde, the high powered businessman who'd been the center of her world. Now a crisis concerning Julian's young son - her adored stepchild had brought Liane back into his life. The past rushed into the present, and it was all Liane could do to maintain her fragile hold on her control. Because, despite everything, she still loved Julian, body and soul......First of all, I would like to say that overall, I liked the book, but parts of it really irritated me. I like older romance stories and have read them for a long time, so I know most of the tried and true plots, but the young and gullible girl believing lies about her husband just is a real turn off in a book. With that said, I recommend reading it and judging for yourself because the rest of the story and characters saved it for me.",

Great collection,"What can I say. If you are a fan of &#34;The Magic Tree House books&#34; this is an amazing collection of narrated audio-books by no other than the author, Mary Pope Osborne herself. She does an amazing job.

The Ultimate In Warm Hearted Story Telling!!!,"Once again Brendan O'Carroll shows us why he is the master of truly warm hearted and loving story telling with a huge dose of comedy tossed in.

If you don't love his work you have absolutely no tastes at all.",
Good series,Love the David Raker series,
Slow start but a good coming-of-age tale,"Initially, I found The Wish Maker a difficult book to follow.  The beginning has a tendency to meander and ramble a bit so I found it hard at times to follow the narrative thread.  It took me a while to understand that the first chapter takes place in the present while subsequent chapters take place in the past.  My major quibble about the book would be with the timeline because it is hard to tell at times whether the events described take place in the present or past...Once I got past my confusion, though, I found the book to be an interesting coming-of-age tale.  It centers mostly around Zaki and Samar, who are cousins but are brought up almost like siblings.  Much of the book describes their childhood and it's a childhood that isn't all that different from an American childhood.  However, it is set against a background of some major historical events in Pakistan.  It's interesting how these events are treated almost casually but it also makes sense that they would be treated thus.  The characters, like most of us, are concerned with their day-to-day events and so, even though these historical events are important to them, they sometimes take a backseat to the characters' more immediate concerns...Another aspect of the novel that I found interesting were the ways in which Western culture has influenced Pakistan in the past and continues to influence it today.  I found a scene in a Pizza Hut to be particularly vivid and it makes for a nice reminder of how taking one small piece of a culture can lead to a somewhat warped view of the whole...Sethi has a nice voice and spins a good yarn.  However, I think he could benefit from some brevity and a bit more clarity.  I had a hard time getting through the first part of the book and even put it aside for a while and read a couple of books in between.  I'm glad that I persisted with it but had the narrative been tighter right from the beginning, I would probably have enjoyed the novel more.  The risk is that not every reader will persist and I think that would be a shame because I ultimately found this to be a good story about the impact of family relationships and how they shape individuals.",
Love it.,Changed my entire mindset. Love it.,
characters don't match time period,"I enjoyed the characters in the book.  My opinion is they don't fit the time period that this book was taking place in.  The characters seemed very progressive for this historical time period. When reading, at times I forgot the book was set in post-Revolutionary days.",
Great!,It is excellent. Exactly what I wanted. the only thing to watch for is it's size. I'm sure it is clearly marked but it was a smaller size than I anticipated.,
Fun and quirky....,"This was a fun book to read. It had the slightest vibe of Joan Aiken and Lemony Snicket, but it was overall more upbeat. While it was entertaining to get to read about Bronte's visits with each of her aunts and her adventures, it did start feeling a bit long. Lots of visits and aunts and people are smashed into the story. I really liked Bronte, though. She had just enough sarcasm to make her charming and humorous, but not enough to make her annoying. I especially appreciated her desire to help others, particularly with her Aunt Carrie...If you're looking for a fun and quirky story about a clever young lady, with magic, humor, and adventure thrown in, this one is worth a try!",
fantastic book,"Love this cookbook. great pictures, wonderful recipes that are easy to follow and replicate. I love the glossary in the back with definitions and tips on unusual items.I've made 3 or 4 of the recipes already and we've loved them all.",
"Great history along with great, realistic characters","At first I was a little disappointed in this book, because I was expecting a book more along the lines of Khaled Hosseini's &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34;  Something poetic that highlighted the everyday in the average Chechen's life...  Instead, this book is more about violence that took place during the Russian's occupation of Chechnya, and how it played out on the ground for some ordinary villagers, as well as a Russian female doctor.  But after I finished the book, and started thinking on the story more, I had(have) to admit it's really rather a good book.  Really brings to life all of the main characters (i.e. Sonja, the doctor, Havaa, a villager who loses her family, and Akhmed, the man who saves her by bringing her to Sonja).  I am more of a political person, and so have read all about the violence perpetrated on the Chechen population by the Russians, and the various &#34;holy war&#34; battles by the Chechens in response.  So I think I was accepting more stories along those lines.  Instead, the main character, Sonja, is Russian, and prior to this book I knew very little about Russians who had been &#34;resettled&#34; in Chechnya.  So learning more about that community was fascinating.  In addition, I had known very little about the &#34;disappearances&#34; of ordinary Chechens in an effort to get them to report on their neighbors (rather like the disappearances of large populations in various Latin American countries), so that was quite interesting too.  The author's rendering of Sonja is brilliant (i.e. how daily violence affects those buried under it, even if the violence does not happen to them directly).  Highly recommend the book.",
do not remember the book. Guess i wasn't impressed ...,do not remember the book.  Guess i wasn't impressed.,
Book number 7 of a 13 book series,Book number 7 of a 13 book series.  Starts off slow then increases the pace to a surprising finish.  The book audio performer was excellent.,
great life stories,top notch,
Four Stars,wonderful book,
Five Stars,My friend loves it,
Journey of the Soul,"Loved this book.  Cheryl Strayed tells the raw story of his life mishaps that lead to her decision to hike the PCT, then shares the stories of the hike.  Although moments in the book feel a bit repetitive, the overall story of her journey is a great read...A definite choice for those who enjoy travel stories, as well as readers who love transformational memoirs...Enjoy!",
Love the scary stories,A new TWO books to enjoy!  So happy to be reading a Terri Reid story again..I'm an old (too true) reader but Terri has helped me through more than a few rough patches in my life.  It's like  coming home to read her books.  Thank you Terri for filling the years (4) since I became a widow.,
Escaping to a Fantasy World,"When we first meet heroine Altana, she is a precocious, stubborn 5-year old whose sense of fairness is easily offended. After a particularly humiliating episode in which she is reprimanded (instead of adored as usual) by her teacher, she is magically transported to a strange land full of strange beings. It is pretty plain that she is not in Kansas (in this case, New York) any more. Altana makes a friend who introduces her to her family and the foreign customs of the land, which is called Ilmarinen.  There are magical plants and talking centaurs.  Healing (or the practice of  medicine) is forbidden. Young readers will follow with excitement as Altana encounters one dangerous situation after another. Just before disaster strikes, Altana awakes in her home world, where no one believes a word about her fantastical journeys. The years pass, and we see Altana go on to middle school and high school.  Her mundane world is marked by the customary rites of passage.  Middle schoolers bully her,  and she feels the sting of personal betrayal. At crucial times, Altana either escapes (or is she summoned?) back to Ilmarinen, where she is destined to fulfill a prophecy which will free the inhabitants from a ruling despot.  Before I finished it, my one reservation about recommending this story for youg readers was that it seemed  that Altana had not even a modicum of modesty. Alas, I judged too soon!  Before the surprising conclusion,  Altana gains insights that endeared her to me.  Prologue becomes epilogue in this enchanting tale.",
Worth every Galleon!,"[[VIDEOID:2f366ad0920763d3bfcf2570a5c9d882]] I pre-ordered this for myself months ago. These are hands down the most beautiful and artistic versions of the Harry Potter book series. The quality is exceptional. I have three copies of the series (my old books from initial release, the complete red hardback copies with Hungarian horntail box, and now starting to collect these) and can confirm that these are truly the most elite version to date...Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima (MinaLima masterminds) created the graphic designs behind all the famous graphic elements of Harry Potter as seen in films. They created the famous letter from Hogwarts, the Marauders Map, Daily Prophet, the howler, the black family wallpaper, the wanted posters and so much more. I have grown up reading the books, watching the films and am beyond obsessed with the Wizard World. These books are so ornate and astonishing to someone who has reread the series multiple times, that it feels like I am reading the novels as a child for the first time. The book has several popup elements, beautiful color images, and more that make it such an interactive reading experience. From the high-quality hardback cover to each colored image, to the perfectly printed paragraphs, the work is phenomenal...Pros:.-Beautiful Green Hardback cover with gold foil details.-Thick sturdy pages.-Pop out panels for a more interactive experience.-High resolution vibrant colors throughout..Cons:.-Be mindful about the pop-up/interactive features around younger children, while this is very sturdy it can rip if mistreated..-doesn’t come in resealable plastic bag to protect it like the last book..A few Important Spells (with Immaculate Illustrations) mentioned in this:.-Oculus Reparo.-Immobulus.-Fera Verto.-Finite Incantatem.-Expelliarmus.-Everte Statum.-Serpensortia.-Vipera Evanesca.-Wingardium Leviosa.-Cistem Aperio.-Arania Exumai.-Obliviate..Overall: My videos and images do not do this justice! I would highly recommend this. I will be getting every version as it realizes on Amazon. I guarantee this will make the perfect gift and that this would make any Harry Potter fan, Hogwarts student or former Hogwarts alumni extremely happy!",
Dried out?,"None of this worked.  The paints were completely dried out.  The stickers didn't keep the paint where they should have.  The dotter is the best part.  I'll let you in on a secret - you can buy the dotter and look up patterns on YouTube or pinterest.  It is a really fun idea, it is poorly executed.",
Finished in 1 night!!,"I give this book 5 out of 5 stars, because it is action packed and has super fun adventures. I recommend this book for ages 8 to adult. This is a super cool series! I can read this book in a few days I like it that much!",
doc fan,Great story loved the colors but not as durable of the pages as some of her other books...,
Five Stars,One of my grandsons' favorite books - will make a great Christmas gift!,
Very good book from beginning to end,"Since I know the author for a long time, I know that this is one of his best books to date.  I got it on Kindle and read it from cover to cover, and found it to be very suspenseful but yet thoughtprovoking as well...I really liked the book a lot and will probably re-read it again when the paperback comes out later this year.  Thank you Brad, for doing another one of your thrillers.  I look forward to your next one when it comes out.",
World's longest running 'Best of' horror anthology!,"'Best New Horror' is now the longest running annual 'best of' horror anthology ever, beating the previous 22-volume record held for the past eighteen years by DAW Books for 'The Year's Best Horror Stories' (1971-1994). Although, in fairness to the industrious Ellen Datlow, she has - so far - edited an unbroken run of 25 annual 'best of' anthologies, twenty-one with St. Martin's Press and currently four with Night Shade Books. Of course, both have a ways to go yet to beat the mighty Gardner Dozois, who has edited a colossal 34 'best of' science fiction volumes since 1977, five with the publisher Dutton and, presently, twenty-nine editions of 'The Year's Best Science Fiction'...Last year 'Best New Horror' and Datlow's 'The Best Horror of the Year' overlapped by quite a few stories: this year none overlap. In fact, together with Paula Guran's 'The Year's Best Dark Fantasy & Horror', only one story is duplicated out of a total of 77, making this year a true embarrassment of riches...RAMSEY CAMPBELL leads off with ""Holding the Light"". Curiosity, a burning need to just know: the curse of youth, as young Tom and Lucas find out when they go exploring a local tunnel said to be haunted. As ever, Campbell's language is deceptively simple, the accumulative effect eerie, one of dread...Next up CHRISTOPHER FOWLER gives us a mischievous piece of whimsy, presented as the monologue of a patron of The Jack O'Lantern pub telling a new customer about the strange events that always seem to occur there throughout its history on All-Hallows Eve. Readers of Fowler's recent Hammer-homage horror novel 'Hell Train' will know just how delightfully sly he can be, and as with the best of tongue-in-cheek horror ""Lantern Jack"" still manages to give a nasty bite at the end...""Rag and Bone"" by PAUL KANE is classic Best New Horror. I heard once that, with the overwhelming number of stories he has to consider each year, editor Jones will often read the first few pages then skip to the last few: if the story ends up going in the direction he thought it was then what's the point? After many decades in the business he wants to be surprised. So no surprise, then, he picked Kane as this story of a scrap merchant - a rag and bone man - doesn't finish up where you think it will...""Some Kind of Light Shines from Your Face"" by GEMMA FILES is from the World Fantasy and British Fantasy Society Award-nominated 'Gutshot', an anthology of weird western stories edited by Conrad Williams. Western it certainly is, but it also involves Greek legends: a young woman joins two women in a travelling wagon, crossing the American dustbowl and scraping up a living by setting up tent and displaying their wares to grubby patrons eager to spend the little coin they have on catching a glimpse of the fair flesh and secret parts of comely women; to look on something fine to take their minds off their dry, barren existence. The women wear masks on stage, and when young Persia Leitner is eventually allowed to join them as well, a trinity is formed, and something happens... and old myths become new reality...""Midnight Flight"" by JOEL LANE is, as the author himself says in the introduction, ""a story about the loss of memory, and how memory might not want to be lost."" Concerning a man slowly recalling the title and details of a lost book from his childhood, whilst losing the identity of who he is now, the language very much recalls classic Ramsey Campbell in the author's claustrophobic depiction of misinterpretation and paranoia - and even manages to out-do Campbell in the closing page!..""But None Shall Sing for Me"" by GREGORY NICOLL is a piece of exotic horror set in the Caribbean and told from the point of view of a zombie. No, this isn't the knock about fun of Tim Powers' terrific `On Stranger Tides' novel, but an intense tale of closure and setting oneself free...Some of the best horror is the simplest, as demonstrated by ALISON LITTLEWOOD in ""About the Dark"". Three youths, Adam, Fuzz and Sasha, enter what is locally known as the Dark Cave. Through Sasha, we learn that there is a darkness in the cave, and not simply an absence of light. Many people have gone into the cave. Some never came back, their names written on the walls. Adam has recently started attending a new school, where he has reinvented himself from the bullied to a strong and disinterested figure who doesn't care about anything. Except he does. He cares about Sasha, but because of the newly created image of himself he doesn't show it and she goes with Fuzz instead, which annoys him greatly. Only once do all three enter the dark; thereafter Adam ventures alone and learns about the dark... and the names... and who puts them there. Understated, exact, and with an atmosphere that closes in on you. A frequent contributor to the UK's premiere horror fiction magazine, `Black Static' (wherein this story was first published; another story she had in the same magazine last year was reprinted by Ellen Datlow), Littlewood recently hit the UK bestseller lists with the publication of her well-received debut novel `A Cold Season'...In ""The Photographer's Tale"" by DANIEL MILLS Lowell's estranged apprentice, Patrick, sends him a camera. It's 1892 and this camera is the very latest model. It is also unique, as Lowell soon finds out. When looking through the lens it reveals not only what the subject will eventually look like in old age, but what secrets lie beneath their mask of make-up and outward personality. And once Lowell sees the truth, he sees it everywhere... even when no longer looking through the lens...""The Tower"" by MARK SAMUELS comes from his collection `The Man Who Collected Machen and Other Weird Tales'. In this deceptively simple story a man, disillusioned with the modern commercial world and the vapidity of its future he envisions ahead, begins seeing a fog-enshrouded tower, where there shouldn't be any, in the middle of the city of London. A symbolism, he believes, for where he's trying to go, what he has to become. The power of this tale lies in the telling, and is on a par with the measured surrealism of Thomas Ligotti. Both write fresh horror, but imbued with the disciplined style of old masters like M.R. James, Robert Aickman, Algernon Blackwood and, of course, Arthur Machen. This is his seventh appearance in `Best New Horror' since volume 15...Last year's ""Christmas with the Dead"" by Joe R. Lansdale was Best New Horror's knock-about story; this year PETER ATKINS picks up that mantel in the delightful and snappily written ""Dancing Like we're Dumb"". It sees the return of his detective character, Kitty Donnelly, in a short, breezy tale of gangsters dabbling in the supernatural. It starts off with Kitty being carjacked and kidnapped: her day just gets worse from there on out!..""An Indelible Stain Upon the Sky"" by SIMON STRANTZAS is an emotionally complex story, allegorical, symbolic and thick with meaning and portent: Port McCarthy, once beautiful, is a damaged town, wrecked by an oil tanker spill. Our narrator and his wife Suzanne, once filled with hope and love, now stained like the town. Both fates - the town's and the couple's - are intricately entwined. Returning alone ten years after the town's accident to the inn they first stayed in, and the beginning of his wife's own descent, the narrator reflects on the crumbling of the past, seeing stains and shadows in the room and how his way of thinking, and what he said, came to infect his wife. The rich symbolism of the closing passages have a deep, ironic weight. This is horror of raw feelings, the writing delicately balanced, and being a tale of non-explicit horror it would not have looked out of place in this year's `The Best American Short Stories'...""Hair"" by JOAN AIKEN comes from her posthumously published collection. Brief, but sharp, it tells of Tom keeping a promise to his recently deceased young wife to deliver a lock of her hair to her mother, whom he has never actually met before, his wife having been estranged from her for some time. An old woman, and very strange, Tom soon wishes he had still never met her...Echoes of Ramsey Campbell's influence can also be heard in the tight, dread-filled language of STEVE RASNIC TEM's ""Miri"", which marks his 16th appearance in Best New Horror. Here Rick finds his new life invaded by memories of a damaged and needy girl from his college days. Memories so tangible as to blur and make indistinct the reality he's currently trying to live in...""Corbeaux Bay"" by GEETA ROOPNARINE is a short but effective story of a man who likes to get away from it all by exploring his local beach, where birds to whom he was cruel and dismissive in the past, now take a keen interest in him...""Sad, Dark Thing"" by MICHAEL MARSHALL SMITH is from what was easily last year's best original horror anthology, ` A Book of Horrors' edited by Stephen Jones, which I've reviewed and where readers can find my thoughts on this story. As I said of a Smith story in a review of another Jones anthology from last year, `Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', everything Smith touches at short story length these days turns to gold.  As for this present story, suffice it to say here that it was also reprinted in `The Best British Short Stories 2012', a non-genre literary anthology...ROBERT SILVERBERG is easily the longest serving writer here: his first short story sale was in 1954 when he was eighteen-years-old - almost 60 years ago. Silverberg is a solid novelist, but a dazzling short story writer, as witness the recent massive retrospective from Subterranean Press, `Phases of the Moon: Stories from Six Decades' (2004), and as too witness this present story, ""Smithers and the Ghosts of the Thar"", published in what is now the author's seventh decade as a professional writer. Although Silverberg is indelibly associated with the science fiction genre, Jones has had occasion over the years to reprint his short stories in some of his themed anthologies, but this marks his first appearance in Best New Horror - and it's a welcome inclusion...Old masters such as M.R. James and Robert Aickman are talked of with reverence these days. Will REGGIE OLIVER one day be talked of that way? No, he already is. Oliver's contribution, ""Guieta Non Movere"", is actually lifted from his novella ""The Giacometti Crucifixion"" where it served as a story-within-a-story. That's how good Oliver is, when 'half' a story is so rich in language and storytelling that it can stand on its own...""The Crawling Sky"" by JOE R. LANSDALE sees the return of the Reverend Jedidiah Mercer, who first appeared in the author's cult weird wild west novel 'Dead in the West' (1986), and in recent years in a series of short stories, one of which, ""Deadman's Road"", was included in Best New Horror 19. Lansdale has a voice soaked in the dialect of his East Texas home and his dialogue crackles with sun-lazy barbs and quips, his beloved landscape conjured with a few deft strokes of description. Here the Reverend finds himself in a spit of a little town called Wood Tick where, with shunned local Norville, he goes out to a ramshackle homestead to banish a 'haint' that is not of this world - and his doesn't do so with prayer and holy water!..Together with Simon Strantzas, SIMON KURT UNSWORTH has clearly become a firm favourite of editor Stephen Jones, both having appeared four times now in the  past five volumes of Best New Horror. Here he gives us ""The Ocean Grand, North West Coast"" from his linked-collection of haunted dwellings, `Quiet Houses'. Mandeville, Parry and Yeoman form a restoration crew, and the Ocean Grand is their biggest project yet. Built at the turn of the last century and slowly neglected by a procession of changing owners over the decades, it has now lain derelict for 15 years. An ambitious design, a marriage of function and art, the concept of the hotel was to show the industrial design on the ground floor gradually changing into that of nature on the third floor. As the author himself says, ""[it's] about art created to be viewed, being alone, and going slowly claustrophobically mad.""..The multi-award winning EVANGELINE WALTON may have died in 1996, but here Jones presents us with ""They That Have Wings"", a 'lost' story of World War II in the great tradition of `Weird Tales' magazine...""White Roses, Bloody Silk"" by rising star THANA NIVEAU is quite different from her contribution of last, ""The Pier"". This Victorian era tale of terror may start out slight and whimsical - but don't be fooled: a dinner party and a strange guest soon turns thorny. And bloody...""Passing Through Peacehaven"" is RAMSEY CAMPBELL's second story in this year's volume (he is the only author to be twice given the honour of having two short stories reprinted within a given volume of Best New Horror). Next to Silverberg, Campbell is the second longest serving author in this current edition of Best New Horror, his first sale being in 1962 (indeed, he was only sixteen-years-old; even younger than Silverberg!). He is, without doubt, a giant of the horror field and this year marks his 50th anniversary as a writer. Finally, Best New Horror 23 ends with ""Holiday Home"" by DAVID BUCHAN, a piece of crime flash fiction...There are other fine stories, ""Wait"" by CONRAD WILLIAMS, which I reviewed last year under its original publication in 'Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', one of the best ghost anthologies in years. Prolific novelist and short story writer TIM LEBBON give us a ""Trick of the Light"", a sensitively handled tale from the extremely good and recommended 'House of Fear' edited by Jonathan Oliver (Datlow and Guran also picked stories from this anthology). Plus the author of the bestselling 'Let the Right One In' JOHN AJVIDE LINDQVIST's first short story, my review of which can be found under 'A Book of Horrors'. Six of that anthology's stories have now been reprinted, Ellen Datlow gave special citation to a further two stories in the opening paragraph of her Summation in 'The Best Horror of the Year: Volume Four', one other story has recently won an award and yet another story has been nominated for an award - making that 10 stories that have been 'named checked'; a quite remarkable achievement considering the anthology only contains fourteen stories in total...[This review comes from an advance copy bought at the FantasyCon, Brighton book launch on September 29th.]..Also released today is 'The Mammoth Book of Ghost Stories by Women' edited by Marie 0'Regan - well worth checking out!",````````````
Great deal great product and arrived on time. And fit like they said they would.,Good audition to my other books.,
"Absolutely wonderful, must read book!","This is an absolutely phenomenal book! The writing is great, and the story is amazing (and based on real people). A young Venetian girl is kidnapped into slavery and ends up in the harem of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Because she is well educated, she becomes a companion to the heir, Mehmed.  A tragic accident ends that path for her, but she ultimately becomes the wife of the next Sultan, with great influence.  This is the absolute barest of summaries, but if you like historical fiction you will love this book!l The cultural mores, the political realities, human frailties, love and more are all there. It will keep you reading long into the night.",
Great for bread recipes.,Love this cookbook.,
"Very good, engaging book","I enjoyed reading this book.  It is a very good freshman effort. Well written and well edited. I enjoy in-depth character development, and find it all too often missing in many books today.  Loose ends and contradictions drive me bonkers. So to find that there weren't any obvious loose ends in this book and the characters were wonderfully developed along the journey, not by tedious outside descriptions, but by their actions, choices and even their turn of phrase, made me a very happy reader. The action was well treated as well, and all of it kept me up reading more pages at night than I had started out intending to read...I respect the author's different views on relationships and marriage, so the only criticism I have is based on personal preference: I would have preferred that the love interests in the story would have taken the plunge and gotten married, rather than just had sex. It cheapened the story a bit to me. But that is my view of romance - to each their own...Congratulations Ms. Cashore.  I look forward to reading your next book as well. Take all the time you need to make it as wonderful as this one.",
LOVE CATS!,Purchased as an extra gift for an adult friend. She loved it.,
Very Nice Book,I am currently reading this book and enjoying it.  It has many nice ideas for projects using sock yarn which I have lots of.  This book arrived on time and in excellent condition.,
Excellent tale!,"Lucy is a spoiled rich girl, daughter to a spoiled rich woman. She is sent back to England from Singapore during world war II and decide to run away to London with a fit who has been sent to the fourth to escape the blitz. Their adventures, the people they meet and the elements of the war they are exposed to are the bulk of the novel.  However the real story is her recognition that her continued path of spoiled rich girl will lead to a meaningless life lived like her dilettante mother .  Great characters and great character development",
Love my Bennett Klein books!!!,I very much enjoy Bennett Kleins books! I find coloring in them to be restful and calming. And fun!!,
Great read,Another great read full of suspense with !Amy twists and turns with an unexpected ending. I'm looking forward to the next story of Reed and Billie.,
Great book for kids,Our daughter-in-law loved the book when as a child she read it in its original Swedish. She was delighted to get the English version for our 3-year old granddaughter.,
Lovely,"Such a wonderful book. I connect to the main character completely and really enjoyed the journey through this time period. More than a love story, a coming of age as well. I think Austen herself would have appreciated this novel. Well done",
great quality,beautiful map,
Do not judge this book by its cover. Its very pretty cover.,"Do you like your male love-interests perfectly robotic?.Do you like unrelatable obnoxiously wealthy protagonists who love to remind you they are in fact, super rich? (So rich they don't even know or care what brand their generic &#34;designer&#34; shoes are?).Do you like books about Stockholm Syndrome?.Do you like pages, upon pages, upon pages of exposition?.Do you like books with unremarkable relationships that just magically 'click' into place when it's clear neither character would or should be even remotely interested?.Then this is the book for you!",
MISSING PAGES,"The book is great. The 17 missing pages near the end are NOT GREAT. I bought this book back in April, so by the time I got to reading all four-hundred-something pages, it was too late to return the book for one that isn't missing pages 402-419.",
good,Good book and as usual the people that translate this from written text to the digital did an excellent job.,
Five Stars,An interesting and talented man.,
Helpful,"It was very helpful.  Most of the training techniques are great.  I was shocked that in two places they recommended hitting the dog.  The rest was all very good.  There was a lot of information on other resources, etc.",
Be ready for some wild twist,What a great book really enjoyed the plot,
"Good sturdy, well illustrated book","My sons love books and 'Little People' books are very sturdy, well illustrated learning books.  Lots of interactive flaps they like to open and look at or have me explain.",
Good reference book,Needed this book as required reading for a class I was taking. The book was described in enough detail that I knew I was ordering the exact edition that I needed and the condition was exactly what I was looking for in a book. Delivery was very fast and the price was the best I was able to find. Saved me a trip to the book store to pay more for the exact same book. The book is an excellent reference guide and continues to be of use even though there are newer editions out.,
another great read,Ben Coes has hit another winner. Giving Mitch Rapp a.Run for his money. Keep it up.Mr Coes a devote fan .,
8 Year Old Son Cannot Put it Down,so it must be good!,
It's just a poorly-written term paper,"This book is easy to read, I'll give it that.  But it is very poorly organized.  It's like someone just sat down and started rambling about ERP without really outlining the book.  Sections are repeated throughout the book.  Major point are difficult to extract.  If I had written this, I'm sure I would have gotten a C.  At least that's what I'd give it.  It just needs to be re-organized.",
Nice coloring book,"I like the book. The only thing that I was highly disappointed with was that most of the hairstyles were already shaded in black. So u really didn't have the option to switch up hair color. Other than that, it was ok",
"Great entrances, then stalled","I like the concepts behind this book and its stance. “The Electric Joy of Service,” for example, hits hard and immediately with a racist engineer building a lawn jockey-inspired bot, an idea only barely offensive to the industry. But these stories didn’t go past the opening seconds for me: a lot of flash, but I was waiting for them to pickup further, and they made motions of doing so, but somehow stood still. Shame, cuz i saw so much going for them.",
The literary equivalent of modern art...,"After slogging through the first 100 pages of this snoozer I was suddenly seized with the thought that the king might actually have no clothes.  Turning to the last few pages I realized I was right!  This book is the literary equivalent of modern art with the ""intelligencia"" standing around, hands clasped behind their backs, murmuring about how the author has so masterfully ""captured the passage of time"", etc.  Joyce pranked us all with Ulysses and now McGregor is playing the same game, banking on the critics' gullibility. Frankly there are better ways to pass your time...",
Awesome Read!,It was amazing page-turner! I couldn't quit reading! I loved it from the first page to the last... it left me wanting more so I went and got the next book in this great saga!,
Great book!,"Love the characters and the writing. Such a unique story, really loved it!",
Helpful,Helpful reference book when getting use to the new OS.,
Nice,Very good guide. Thanks,
Very good read,"I love historical romances, especially when they are based on real people and facts.  If it's embellished somewhat to make the story more interesting, that's fine.  This book told another side of the monster that was Hitler and how a small number of people in a tiny little village in Germany risked their lives and did their part to fight back.",
"Good book, but don't expect your first grader to ...","Good book, but don't expect your first grader to be able to read through it alone.  My first grader can read through many but this had some advanced words that required some defining and explanation for him.  Great illustrations, simple, basic, but informative. Would recommend to add to your book shelf!..I received this product for free in exchange for a review.",
Thoroughly enjoyed A History of Wales.,"I really enjoy history.  This book helped me understand what Wales had been though as a people and a country,  Helped me learn about my ancestors and my geneology.  The author kept my interest with his style of writing.",
Four Stars,I enjoyed it. Worthwhile read.,
GOOD FOR ME !,GOOD FOR ME !,
Excellent. Just excellent.,Kyle Mills has faithfully executed the Vince Flynn characters and scenarios to a very familiar place. Mr. Flynn would be proud of this novel. Great story line. Compelling action and a terrific host of bad guys. Well done Mr. Mills. Well done.,

Couldn't put it down!,"So glad I picked up this book to read. Well written and worth all the sleep lost, because I couldn't stop reading.",
A presidential saga!,At times it was hard to keep up with all the characters but it all came together with mystery and intrigue! You get an eye opening picture of politics!,
More like an adult coloring book,"I was excited to make this purchase, thinking it was a 3rd book by this author but it turned out to be more like an adult coloring book.",
Seems to be a better written and more thorough compilation of past concepts,Seems to be a better written and more thorough compilation of past concepts. I just wish I didn't enjoy fermented foods so much as my kitchen tends to smell like farts that an old man had been holding since world war 2.,
Excellent,This is such a great tool for establishing the discipline of daily bible reading for children! Five stars. Hope that Dr Murray continues to make these books,
good read.,Not sure what to write but i do enjoyed the book. I read a chapter a day everyday and someday I found myself looking forward to what would happen next. Recommended.,

Grandma has a birthday and grandson gets some books.,"It's my birthday; therefore, our grandson gets some books.",
Once I started reading I didn’t stop for 9 hours!!,"AMAZING!.Another story by Caroline and Susanne that just sucks you in! It’s so fitting the ROLLER COASTER of emotions you’ll find when you visit Sinners Playground and the Harlequin crew. The perfect amount of laughter, angst, badassery, and sexiness !.Without spoiling it for fans who have read other series by these authors, some parts will have you squealing with giddiness at some references 😉.This series is quickly becoming my new favorite from this duo, can’t wait to see what happens next !!",😉
"An absorbing history, especially if you were the rebut didn’t notice.",Fascinating trip down Memory Lane. Well-researched and written. Highly recommended.,
Middling,Okay story but the overt political jabs became annoying and seemed silly.  I don't think I'll bother reading any more C.J. Box books.,
The real war in Iraq,"As a Viet Nam vet knowing what & how we sniped it was very interesting to read Gunny Coughlin's story. Iraq was a very different kind of war, but looking through the scope with his eyes brought back many memories. Thanks Gunny for your courage & your expertise. Just like a lot of us Gunny came home to the real world to face changes. I wish him well. Sgt Norris, USMC 62-66",
Graphic Memoir,"This graphic novel is essentially the memories of the author, with vignettes from their life.  Some of the vignettes are stories and graphics she drew back in high school, while others are just memories from her school years and college.  Several of them were really funny and I thought, even insightful.  One of them is about staying on a houseboat with a friend and not being allowed to use the toilet on board.  Another is about the neurosis behind making a decision on eye glasses.  Other stories deal with LGBTQ relationships and drama, dealt with in humor and reality...Overall, it was not a great read, but I did think some of the stories were really hilarious and cut to the bone of human reactions in a pretty smart way.",
Just like Yiayia's cooking :-),"I LOVE this cook book!  My Yiayia, who was straight out of Greece and came to America through Ellis Island, had one and used it all the time, after she passed away my cousin got her cook books so I searched all over for this one... all of the recipes that I have had from it are delicious and everytime I make something from it it reminds me of Yiayia :-)",
Just right size for travel,"Perfect for travel, fit just right in recently purchased passport holder [[ASIN:B01DLN9SZ0 Passport Wallet - Bavallo Premium Travel Neck Wallet - Passport Holder with RFID Blocking To Keep Your Identity Safe and Durable YKK Zippers]].  Stickers not reusable type, once done it's done, but for the price definitely worth the play value",
Wonderful Product!,"I took out all the cards that made reference to magic, and then it was a wonderful product! I am a substitute teacher, and it is a great way to fill five minutes if the class finishes with the assigned projects. The children loved sharing their responses to all the creative questions!",
Cost,Not my favorite,
An amazing story,"This short book will take you from disapproving, to shocked, to completely appalled, to amazed in the 48 hours it takes you to read it.  Room is fascinating and you're not going to be able to put it down.",
I consult this Book daily.,"Easy format, full of essential oil information and filled with tips on what and how to use them. Great book for anyone starting out in the Essential Oil world.",
This book can change your life.  A real eye opener!,Just completed reading this book.  It has now changed my way of thinking how we must be grateful everyday for all we have or don't have.  A book I wish everyone would read!  It has daily homework which really makes you think of what is truely important in your life and how to make it happen.,
A great book my grandson loves it.,A great book,
Heart wrenching and heart warming.,"This shows the power of evil, goodness, and the human spirit.",
Good Information for Training Adult Learners Quickly,"I manage Quality Assurance at my company and monitoring the training of employees in various processes is a small part of the audit process. Although I still have a good bit to go before completing the book, I'm very happy with the additional information it's providing me. An old school way to quickly teach adults industrial processes for repeatability.",
Great value for money,Charlie and Lola stories are adorable,
Bosch lite--but very good,"Amazon summarizes the facts well...I have read all of his books and have never disliked one. The Bosch series is much deeper, darker and better, while the Hallers are good, but Haller remains somewhat of a shallow character and the other characters are cardboard thin..  Here, some seismic events--losing a race for DA; having a freed client commit a horrible crime--are glossed over too quickly and a romance pops up without much development...Nonetheless, this is a fast, engrossing read and better written than most Grisham or Tannenbaum legal thrillers, while being less ponderous than some of the Turows.",
St Jude,It's a great story. But I need to return them. I brought the wong one.,
The story is a wonderful lesson about enduring friendship,I'm a preschool teacher and I just adore this book.  The story is a wonderful lesson about enduring friendship.  The illustrations are sweet.  My kids always enjoy this story.,

this is a really fun simple pattern book,"this is a really fun simple pattern book, good if you havent knit much lace but want to try it out for the first time",
Well written,"I am glad the author has a good story telling style, as books on hauntings tend to be overdramatic. I recommend this to you, reader, for the late night perusing. Enjoyed it!",
Five Stars,Perfect quality and great book content.,
High Quality Manga!,Arrived on time! Can't wait for the entire volume set!,
Entertaining,Good entertaining read that keeps you engaged.,
"Ritchie Rich grew up a thug, E I E I O","It's a true mystery novel. But there are so many pieces to the mystery that when it all resolves at the end, you wish you'd taken notes -- confusion remains. It was brave of Coben to have an unlikeable protagonist who enjoys physically maiming people.  But it kept me entertained with lifestyles of the super rich I had had no knowledge of. All in all, it's a good read.",
Good buy!,Received item as advertised & in a timely manner!,
Two Words: Borrrr-ring!!!,"The person below who said the first 200 pages were good was being kind. I haven't reached page 200 yet and am beginning to wonder if I ever will. I feel like it's two pages forward, one page back! This is not a physchological thriller - this is not a thriller in any category. The murders are pushed way back in the background and are only occassionally discussed. The politics are just plain stupid! I give it one star only due to Ava and Carson's relationship.",
Superior in every way.,These are very high quality journals. They have excellent artwork. It's the only brand I buy.,
A good start to a series!,"Bridget has left the FBI's BAU when she could no longer live with all the horrible crime scenes in her head and is leading a tranquil life in her small town until her former boss appears at her doorstep asking for help. She reluctantly agrees to do a consulting job and dives deep into a worse nightmare. Lessons in Evil has a good plot and characters and is well written, however, it could use a little bit more effort on proofreading as there typing errors, missing words, etc., being the motive as I'm not rating this book 5 stars..I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.",
Toto's Tale is super Sweet!,"Ya'll know the story of The Wizard of Oz,right? Well, I know I know it, and it is one of my FAVORITE movies. I love watching it when it comes on TV (thank goodness for DVRs!). The opportunity arose to review a book called Toto's Tale. At first, I said to myself that I wouldn't review it because it would be too much like a kids book, with lots of pictures and kind of goofy. Not so. Well, I mean it is goofy, but not in the way I was expecting. Goofy in a humorous sort of way. It does say that this book is juvenile fiction/fantasy but I think most anyone who LOVES The Wizard of Oz AND books will love this sweet little tale!..Toto's Tale is told in the point of view of Toto. Yep that's right. The dog. He smells the storm brewing that will lift up the house and twist them and twitch them each way and land them on the wicked witch of the east. What's funny about this little book is that from a dog's point of view, going to Oz is HILARIOUS! The laughs and smiles were certainly rolling off my face when I read this book. Dorothy is his pet girl and he must protect, but then he makes some friends along the way. Some of these friends, were not in the original Wizard Of Oz but still, he makes them and the comics really start rolling then!..Again, I say that this book is juvenile fiction/fantasy, but it's a great, sweet read for most anyone. If you have a young reader in your life, then please, grab a copy (or two or three!). This 5 star little book will be a perfect Christmas gift for them!..*This book was provided for review by PUYB*",
great series,"This was a good book, and a great series.  I enjoyed the books very much, even the parts that made me sad. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good Vampire series. Bryce and Tori made a great couple and thank you Kat Daemon for writing about them!",
Must Have,Truly excellent work and helped me a lot and I passed the cert test in 4 hours not 10!,
Can't beat the classics,The classic shining by Steven King.  Just as scary as the first time I read it.,
Disjointed Story,Not one of his greatest. The story seems like a loosely connected group of short stories. Nobody in the novel seems very admirable.,
terrible,"This may not be Flynn’s worst book but it is surely in the bottom five. It moves at a pace designed to make a snail look quick, and the excitement is comparable to watching paint dry. Worst of all, it is stocked with enough filler to make five crates of bad sausage. Just a terrible book. He tops it off by giving Rapp a desk job and marrying him off to a whiny bitch that slugged him in the face when he came back from a trip suffering from a gunshot wound. Worst of all, our hero whimpered and sniveled and apologized to this bad excuse for a wife. There is no way to sugarcoat how bad this all is.",
Beautiful Book,"I was looking for a book on how to do watercolor portraits, and I came across the cover of this book, whose realism drew me in.  I bought the book at an extremely reduced rate, although it is worth every penny of its original price.  The author/artist does incredible work.  She included many color pallets, which are quite helpful, and she shows the steps she went through to create some of her paintings.  This was EXACTLY the kind of book I was looking for.",
READ this novel! EXCELLENT!,"Very enjoyable! The novel is getting passed around to others, now! Great twist!",
Excellent resource for faculty,This text is a must for every nursing faculty who is struggling with teaching our students the challenging thinking skills they need to be successful in their nursing programs and in passing the NCLEX.,
Very interesting!,Very interesting book.,
Cute Story,"Glad that the heroine got a HEA!  Decent story, funny in places and had enough plot to keep my interest.",
Good novice book,"This is a great book for piano players like me that aren't great, but still trying/learning.  The scores are fairly simple but still give you a good melody to play; I really enjoy playing this book.",
Another Great Book,"I love the In Death series, and this book didn't disappoint me.  It's terribly hard to put any of the books down once I begin them, and this one was no exception.  I definitly reccommend this book to fans of the series and suggest interested people look to the first book, Naked In Death before reading Betrayal.  Reading them in order is always the best way! ^^",^^
Kill the Creature!,I had the great fortune to met the author in Acapulco and he signed my copy of his book. This is a scholarly tome that requires more than one reading of it. Extremely in depth research into the subject complete with pictures of the culprits involved in creating the biggest fraud on America's taxpayers. The Federal Reserve Bank is a criminal cartel run by a mob of banksters. The Laws of Nature will eventually end it as the previous 3 central banks have done.,
Super heavy awkward oversized book,[[VIDEOID:3635af1c39aee0ba57b371668e2a3566]] Russian classic in Russian. I won’t give a review of the literature work as that is up to the critics. The book itself is super heavy and awkward size. It’s an oversized book making it very difficult to hold. Real wrist work out. My hands hurt after reading it for a few hours and holding it up.,
A Must Read for Anyone Who Waited Tables!!,"The reviews I read for this book mostly praised its intelligence and literary pace while diminishing its attention to sensation. Oh, those reviewers are so repressed and unfeeling! Unlike the NYT, I happen to like a nicely paced seduction, and Danler deftly weaves fantastic erotic tones into her tale of tastes and self-discovery. She doesn't give you a nicely wrapped closed ending, but takes you on a sweaty high of the peak of innocence with some pretty gorgeous prose and well-written scenes. Who knew a health inspection could feel so suspenseful?! I've never done cocaine, but I expect that the aftermath feels a bit like the end of this novel. It's a bit edgy, uncomfortable, and the world looks a little less pretty than it was before. Such is the end of innocence, right? I was sad when it was over and I'd definitely read whatever she writes next.",

... but this book is absolute trash and I'm very disappointed. I had been looking forward to reading it ...,"I haven't felt the urge to write a book review in a long time but this book is absolute trash and I'm very disappointed. I had been looking forward to reading it because of the great reviews and the recommendation by Reese Witherspoon, so when it arrived I dove right in. I came away genuinely wondering whether any of the positive reviews were by people who had read a book before. I hate being so harsh, but this book was so contrived and poorly written. The plot was incredibly predictable, the language and dialogue mind-numbing, and the ending so neatly wrapped up it was infuriating. This is honestly not even a good beach read/escape. It's basically a Lifetime movie in novel form.",

Differences and acceptance.,"A great story about differences and ultimately acceptance. Perfect for a classroom, a gift, a child's bookshelf.",
Excellent book 2 of series,"A different case for Murphy and Rossi this time, a dark and disturbing tale but brilliantly written and very addictive, taking on themes of the breaks in our society and turning them into a haunting tale which is also endlessly fascinating...I’m a fan of Murphy and Rossi as a duo – they are a great “crime fiction” pairing, I find one of the strengths of these tales is how Luca gives focus not only to them but to the people they get involved with in each case, we as readers see both sides of the story, even as identities are hidden to allow for some terrific mystery elements...In the case of “The Dying Place” I was not only enthralled and often disturbed by the tale unfolding but it also gave me pause for thought, to consider the heart of Justice and how that can mean different things to different people. At turns terrifying and emotional this really was a wonderfully constructed thriller with hugely appealing characters, both those we know and those we don’t...A very emotional ending with an excellent lead in to book 3, which I can’t wait for, made this one of my top crime reads of last year. Excellent stuff...**Note: This review from author review copy**",
Good read,Straight forward and easy to read. Tons of examples and for someone who is new to programming it has provided a great non-intimidating experience.,
I first got it at the library and she loved it so much,"My 18 month old daughter LOVES this book! I first got it at the library and she loved it so much, I just bought it for her.  She reads it every day.  I like that the story is something you can DO with your child while you read.  The pictures are bright and full of emotion. It arrived in beautiful condition! TOP NOTCH BOOK!",
Wonderful New Fantasy Series,"3.5 stars rounding to 4..I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Defy. I went into this book without any idea what it was about, just that it was a new fantasy series, and I’m always looking for new fantasy to read so I downloaded it asap...In Defy we meet Alexa Hollen… or Alex as she’s better known. She’s a member of the king’s army, being forced to disguise herself as a boy in order to keep herself out of the situation that all other women are thrown into. With the help of her twin brother, Alex uses her skills to earn a position on the prince’s guard...But this is where the main story begins. Even with her skills, she, Prince Damian and fellow guard and friend Rylan are abducted and dragged through the jungle to their enemy’s gates. Where Alex soon finds out that things aren’t exactly as she’s been told, and the secret she and her brother were determined to keep, wasn’t exactly as secret as they thought...I’ll be straight up with you all… love triangle alert. But I think that is fairly evident based on the summary. I’ll also be honest with you and tell you that I don’t hate love triangles like I know some of you do. In this case, it’s very evident to me who she is going to be with. But with this love triangle warning also comes an alert that this turned into being less about the situation Alexa finds herself in and more about how sexy the guys she is with are and I think ultimately that kind of frustrated me...The characters – while I didn’t dislike any of them, I didn’t immediately find myself clinging to any of them either. Is Prince Damian swoony – yes… is Rylan sweet and wonderful to Alex… yes… Is Alexa a strong-willed and independent young girl who can overcome anything – she sure is. All these things together didn’t give me any strong feelings towards anyone in particular though. I just didn’t feel that connection with anyone...My overall thoughts were this – The middle part of this book was slow going for me. I was incredibly bored during their trek through the jungle, but once we started to get a bit more action and less ‘OMG who do I pick’ I found myself enjoying the action and the unraveling of secrets. I think ultimately this is what saved this book for me, we ended up on a high note and I truly found myself finally enjoying the story...I think that for me, this was less fantasy and more YA romance with fantasy elements and I found myself hooked just enough there at the end to know that I will definitely be picking up book 2 in this series to see what Larson does and where this story goes...If you’re looking for a quick read that is hopefully just the start to a wonderful new fantasy series, definitely check this one out!..Thank you to netgalley & Scholastic for the advance copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.",
PCAT book,Awesome book- brand new & shipped super fast. Has everything you need to review for the pcat plus a pratice test at the end.,
Good,Interesting,
Good,Nice thick book that covers a wide range of ice cream and associated treats.,
Very good character development,"Very good character development.  I enjoyed this book a lot.  I would give it five stars if two things were fixed. One is marking changes in scene.  Many times I'd be reading and abruptly the scene would change to something else.  There was no warning like dashed lines or stars just boom completely different local and people.  It made me think i was missing pages somehow and distracted from the reading experience...Spoilers ahead:..Second is there were some glaring plot holes.  The biggest was that the Protectorate never informed the kid's parents about what was going on nor put them in protective custody nor did anything to protect these kids from super terrorists.  The Protectorate works closely with the government and obeys the laws yet we are supposed to believe they would ignore every law and procedure the govt would follow in a similar situation?  Too big a plot hole.  I think it would have been much more enjoyable to read how each of the kids dealt with telling their parent's, at Concorde's insistence.  That would have been more fun and more believable.",
3 stars,it was ok,
Good 1 pager with amazing illustrations,"This is a great read especially as a coffee table book. Each ""Yokai"" is about 1 page, and is a great book to pick up and read for however long you wish. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful, and drawn with so much effort. Grab all three volumes for a great conversation starter, or if you are interested in this subject of Japanese lore.",
i really enjoyed this book!,"This is how Mr. King used to write! A book that does not go on forever. A simple,but good story!!",
Best guide to using Ancestry,"Initially I bought this Ancestry guide for my Kindle, but I found that I used it over and over, and wanted to refer to it back and forth so I bought a hard copy besides.  It has a great deal of information that you won't find anywhere else.  Has paid for itself over and over. No more multiple guides.",
"If you like sweet, quirky characters and have an appreciation for music, you’ll love this story.","Frank owns a music shop and stocks only vinyl, which causes him a great deal of trouble when the vendors refuse to keep him stocked unless he agrees to also carry CDs. But Frank is not just a record seller, he knows exactly what you need to hear and when you need to hear it. His music “prescriptions” have made him a well-loved member of the community but his inability to move with the times threatens to ruin everything he has. One day, a strange, beautiful woman faints right outside his shop and his safe, predictable life is turned upside down...I really enjoyed The Music Shop. It has a fabulous cast of characters. Do you remember the movie Notting Hill? Well, this story has a very similar group of characters who are really more of a family to Frank that just fellow business owners. They are quirky and lovable and well-meaning. Delightful, really...As Frank learns more about Ilse, the woman who faints outside his shop, we also learn about Frank’s relationship with his mother and how he came to love music so much. As I was reading this story I compiled a Spotify playlist of all the songs mentioned, only to find out that the publisher already did it for me!..This story is sweet and funny and a real feel-good book. If you enjoyed her other book, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, you will not be disappointed with this one.",
Absolutely fantastic knitting book,"I have all 3 volumes and they are amazingly thorough, well written, and definitely worth having in your knitting book library!  The author is obviously an expert, but she starts from the very basics for the absolute beginners.  I have really enjoyed reading and learning from these books and continue to refer back to them often.  There are so many beautiful patterns in the books that even a beginner, like me, can follow and accomplish.",

What a story!,"Wow!  This one had me on the edge of my seat. The Wolf, an anti hero, do you love him or hate him? I can't decide; you will have to choose for yourself.  All I can say is, when is the sequel coming out?.The Wolf is a story of gangs vs terrorists. I wish that part were true. We could use the help. Carcaterra writes so well; I almost believed it was true. The characters are strong and unforgettable. The action is non stop..I heartily recommend The Wolf to you. By the way,.The Wolf is a great audio book too. Well read. Excellent for a long car trip.",
Beautiful Doll,The reason I didn't give 5 stars is that her sandals don't stay on very well.  Purchased for Operation Christmas Child.  Beautiful and nice size to fit inside a shoe box well.,
Fun!,Kids loved it!,
Boring,"I, too, was very disappointed in this book.  I read three of Jules other books and found them very interesting and informative about the time and the location.  I kept reading thinking surely something would happen in this one, but I’m almost 2/3 of the way through and nothing has.  This “love” affair is pretty ridiculous, and that seems to be the main thrust of the book.  Otherwise, just talking about what songs to play in saloons, washing shirts and cooking.",
Nice quick read. Gets you thinking,I like the small size. it makes for a quick read and for a small book it packs enough info in it to start up some great conversations. The His-Hers flip book style is genius. Are you new to how things are to work in a relationship? This will set you on the right path with simple discussions on easy topics...I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program..Would I spend my own money on this? No,
Could Not Put this Audio Down!,"Audio Book Review - This was my second Megan Miranda book and I can not wait for the thriller/mystery she releases. The same narrator, Rebekkah Ross, who narrated All The Missing Girls performed The Perfect Stranger. She is easily one of my favorites. I really enjoyed Leah, who is the narrator of the story. And I loved how as the details unfolded, I liked her even more. The whole cast of characters, from supporting, secondary characters to just random extras, they are mattered to the story. They all played a role. What I love about Miranda's writing style, is that it's very simple. It's all easy to follow. It's simple, &#34;I said&#34; and, &#34;He said&#34; and, &#34;she asked&#34;. But this works so well because the story is so deep, you find yourself understanding so much better. I just really loved the way this story was written. I voluntarily reviewed a copy of this book.",
Leaves a lot to be desired,"Lots of cute ideas in the book, but the instructions left much to be desired. The illustration seemed to leave out some of the steps, or have hands covering things I needed to see. Some directions are vague (&#34;form a rose around the band&#34; What?? How??)  The pictures of the compled styles were really nice, but often you are not able to tell exactly how it looks. Overall we had fun, but I would get a different book.",
OK,OK at best.,
Another great book in the Meg and Mog series,"See my other reviews of the Meg and Mog series.  I would recommend them for ages 2-5.  They were favorites of my daughter, Meg, and then later my PreK students.",
He makes it easy to follow along and put it into practice,Zak George makes sense in his approach to training dogs.  He makes it easy to follow along and put it into practice.,
Skip it...,"I listened to the audio book and the narrator Kyle McCarley did a fantastic job. He is the only reason why I finished the book. Because if I had read this it would've been DNF less than 50 pages in...This book is the a reminder for me to be careful what I wish for. The last couple of books I read were sorely lacking in world building, this book took it too far. I could see everything because the details were written that intricately. To the point of boredom. Rooms, clothes, jewelry. Names of titles of nobles, religious leaders, and ceremonies were invented. Which is great, but there were so many it was hard to keep track. Standard names like Lord and Priest would've worked too for lesser characters. I also found it weird that all these intricate names and ceremonies were created, but the animals were standard. And although there was mention of magic there wasn't any in this book...Maia, our hero was boring. The standard orphan forced out of seclusion. The problem is there was nothing outstanding about him. He was nice, but no saint. He was smart, but no genius. He wasn't ugly by Elf society standards, but he was no great beauty either. There was nothing about him that stood out. Nothing to make the reader root for him to ""win"". He was a competent ruler, but no champion of the people. If they had killed him off and replaced him at any point in the book I honestly wouldn't have cared...That is another problem with this story. For one that focused on political intrigue and court politics it was lacking both. Starting with our main character. His banishment being accepted by everyone made no sense. His mother a goblin was married to his father to foster an alliance. So her being banished with her baby right after giving birth for the crime of not being an Elf was beyond stupid. Her father the Goblin Emperor should've had more of a reaction. Then she dies and her son, a Prince is sent off to west bubble fuq. Again the Goblin Emperor does nothing. A man with no male heir. He didn't even send a tutor. Maia the fourth son of the Elf Kingdom and the only Prince of the Goblin Kingdom wasn't educated in anything by anyone. He was sent of to rot, when he should've been a pawn his entire life. There were almost no plots at court, no maneuvering.  Just snobs being jerks...It takes forever for there to be any real conflict and even longer for us to find out what happened to his father and brothers. And both things are resolved with relative ease. How does something finally exciting happen, yet it almost instantly becomes boring too. I really don't understand how this book got nominated for so many awards. It must've been a slow year. I won't say I won't ever read this author again, but I won't be reading any more books in this series.",
"""...a journey toward...self -acceptance and perspective.""","I loved this book, almost from its opening pages.  What function as somewhat parallel stories, related stories, ""Orphan Train"" is peopled with characters that you will come to love and care for, and, as harsh as the circumstances often are, wish for them the very best of outcomes.  Christina Baker Kline's previous book, ""A Bird In Hand,"" was a Vine selection some while ago.  I enjoyed it but I love this story so much more.  ""Orphan Train""...there were such, and over many years they brought in excess of 200,000 homeless children of varied ages to stops along the way in the Midwest and far West, in the hopes of finding homes for them.  Didn't seem to matter whether the homes turned out to be good homes; rather it was almost an effort to remove orphans from the scene, scatter them, often without any care or concerrn as to the circumstances into which they might be taken.  ""Orphan Train"" is a beautifully realized story, moving us back and forth in time from the late 1920's Minnesota to 2011 Maine, back and forth as the pages unfold.  Most memorable, of course, will be our interaction with Niamh (later to be named Vivian) and Molly, Niamh an immigrant girl, who, through circumstances, comes to be on the orphan train, Molly a girl of the present, about to ""age out"" of foster care.  The paths of these two characters cross just when perhaps both need the other the most.  You'll be pulled into this relationship and Vivian's incredible story, perhaps finding, as I did, that the book was impossible to put down.  This is a memorable piece of writing, a lovely novel of which author Baker Kline can be so proud.  She cloaks her history lesson in a tale that will move you, sometimes anger you, but always inspire you as roads, by chance, are taken by these characters, leading them to the book's lovely conclusion.",

Excellent Book,"Excellent book, and very engaging for the reader. This is one of the best books written about men at war, by the men that were there. This book should be on every bookshelf. As one reviewer said, "" Don't think about it. Buy it."" I concur, don't think, buy.",
It’s ok,If your kids is advanced I’d rather you to choose another grade otherwise it’s ok,
Great!,Great beginner book!,
Colorado connection,Excellent historical Colorado story,
"Breathtaking in Concept, Scope and Execution","""Our Nation's Archive: The History of the United States in Documents"" is a phenomenal one-of-a-kind historical compendium that will thrill not only the historian and student, but also any citizen mildly interested in our country's evolution...At around 900 pages, it may seem daunting or just another dusty tome of boring text. Instead, it is fascinating and riveting, providing EVERY important direct source document associated with the U.S., from its birth to its continuation into the modern age...Brilliantly, editors Bruun and Crosby have also managed to include ""documents"" almost never included in history books -- speeches, articles and even poetry -- related to the primary documents of the events of the particular period...For example, official documents pertaining to the Great Depression are reprinted, along with a section from John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath,"" a novel of people who lived and suffered through those Dust Bowl days. Likewise, not only is the Executive Order interning Japanese Americans during World War II included, so is a side-bar describing the impact on Japanese American families who lost all of their property...In an age when everything in society seems to revolve around the latest technological advancement, it is very centering to go through this book and read the true historical achievements of these incredible United States. Vividly illustrating its tragedies, as well as the justice and injustice done in the name of this nation, this book is truly like no other...From the Declaration of Independence and the courts, to the true voices of vaunted politicians in their own words as well as the views of everyday citizens, events come to life in as astonishing a publishing accomplishment to come along in decades...With a ""couldn't-be-cheaper"" price, this edition deserves to be in every home, library and school room in America. Even if you thought you knew the history of the United States from sea to shining sea, there is plenty inside these pages to surprise, delight or even sadden and sicken the most careful scholar...Looked at in its entirety, this single volume not only educates, but in this new millennium, provides a sobering atmosphere to ponder the future of the country and every person's role as a responsible citizen. Bravo!!",
Let's see how long it takes you to figure out who is the quilty one???,"WOW great story, twisted from the start. Matt has his own problems to deal with, let alone handling the case he is given. They may be murder cases, but not into great detail with is a good thing. Your mind keeps you reading, which makes Joy Ellis a great writer. You will get involved quickly and try to figure out who the guilty one is, this will take you till the end to do so.  It took me that long, which makes this a great read. Enjoy it, see if you can figure it out faster!! Enjoy the read!!!!",
Great Follow-Up,This book was a great follow up to the first and I loved it from beginning to end. I can't wait to read more from this author. You are missing out if you don't read this book.,
A nice book for a not well known chapter of World War II,"This book is surely well written and contains a lot of information on the legendary Red Ball Express program which supported the Allied drive in France in 1944, when the great French ports were still out of use and the rail network destroyed by the air strikes. Some of the chapters are indeed not well connected to the rest of the story and have a journalistic style of presentation, but the book has the numbers and the facts that the military history fan seeks. Overall, a good effort with some weak points but valuable nonetheless. It contains some b&w maps, a section of good b&w photos but no appendices. There is also not a reference to the casualties suffered byt the Red Ball Express men, due to accidents or enemy action.",
Dart fan,Makes a great gift for those whom are no familiar with the great Dodge Dart times: good coffee table magazine also.,
Great premise,"I enjoyed Heart-Shaped Box more mainly due to its focused narrative.  I found too many flashbacks that bored me. I realize fleshing out characters is needed, but the flashbacks seem overlong.  Halfway through it finally gave me edge-of-seat reading..I enjoy his comics a lot.  Those I recommend.",
Very well written! Compliments to Dave Canterbury,Good job Dave! Thank you for writing books to share your knowledge on the various topics you have knowledge in. The single thing I would recommend is water resistant paper for those who wish to take the books into the bush,

Darling gift for all ages!,Darling book - I gave these as high school graduation gifts! The messages are applicable to all and with a fun delivery by Pete the Cat.  It is great for all ages!,

Okay for the type of book.,It was overdone in some parts and repetitious in the main characters thinking.,
Delightful,Such a great set of books. The complete collection and just what is needed for anyone who likes a good classic story:),
We Built These Cities,"Today I'm looking at the City and the City by China Mieville. This is a science fiction book that came out a little over a decade ago. I want to like this author's works mainly because he's a comrade. I first read him a couple of years back when he did that version of the Russian Revolution called October. It was a historical novel that was like Ten Days that Shook the world but was better than Ten Days that Shook the World. Since then, I've read a couple of his books, This Census Taker and Three Moments of an explosion and Neither were particularly memorable... This book is a New York Times bestseller and one that you go to and it's supposed to be one of his better ones. If you read the blurbs and just try to get a sense of what's that about you really might not know. The basic premise is that there are two cities that exist independently but in the same geographical space. The people who live in those cities are trained from their youth to ignore what's going on right next to him if they get the signals and the cues that it is from one of them the other City. The thing is that it just didn't really work for me. It was about page 74 and I realized that I was getting most of the World building for this aspect that I was going to get as a reader. I just said I don't believe it. Now here's the thing, everything else is good enough that despite me not believing the world building and the central premise I still want to keep reading...There's a murder mystery and that very Central thing plays huge role in it. What it really got me thinking was what this two-city thing really represented. Was it some geographical political commentary, which I think is a reading that is the end of the easiest to do because it seems like it's right there for analysis? There's also the possibility that isn't there a bigger metaphysical thing. I kept asking myself  are these people already dead are they in purgatory I don't know. The problem with that is there are  people that come in from outside and visit the cities. And then they leave again so that might not be the best reading. Overall, I did read it and I enjoyed it, but I just tried really had to not think about that central thing of the setting because the minute I started thinking of the central premise it didn't work so just kind of was that thing if you ignore the man behind the curtain it's okay but like that curtain just really lamp shaded.",
Five Stars,great dvd,
"Very disappointed on so many levels, not like any book I've ever purchased! Horrible!","Where do I start with this book? It deserves no stars. It's not 25 chapters long. Each recipe is labeled a chapter. So there are 25 recipes & pages do not have page numbers, though the table of contents list pages. Unbelievable errors! Look at the photo, one recipe is double spaced and stretched out over multiple pages. I don't know why this is titled ""The lost Superfoods Book for Beginners / Survival Food Guide & Cookbook for Year Supply and Storage""  There is no info about food storing for a year, no superfoods, so far I don't see any recipes meant to be created out of long term storage foods. Their is no instruction about prepping or survival other than to list the 25 recipes double spaced. Many regular recipes with regular food from fridge, freezer, etc. The gravy and biscuits recipe calls for refrigerator canned biscuits?  You know the kind that you score and they make the loud popping noise. Seriously!! Chili, pasta, yogurt and fruit cups using store made yogurt?? Pasta & meatballs, mac & cheese, for example all use butter, frozen or fresh meat and normal ingredients. Jimmy Dean sausage was listed in one of the ingredient lists. LOL Their are a couple of recipes called Pemmican and Hard Tack that are true long term foods, a jerky recipe but other than that, this is a very poor regular cookbook of worthless recipes that any newbie can find online to learn how to cook basic foods, this is not for long term survival food recipes. This is poor quality. The price of this book is completely over priced. I'm in shock!!!  I have never had this issue buying on Amazon. This should be taken off the market for false advertising. I've never ever had to leave this type of review. Seriously - Don't buy - this is clickbait false advertising, buyer beware!",
Good story but a bit predictable,The story overall is good. Probably 3.5 stars but I gave it 4. The execution is a little clunky and predictable. But I finished it in 3 days (quick for me) so I can’t say it didn’t keep me entertained.,
Five Stars,"Delightful book, especially for people interested in frontier life.  It is also amazing how vivid the imagery is just from reading the letters and a few random drawings.  Her words describe people and situations as well or better even than a movie, and you realize you don't really need to see an actual picture to get a complete account what is happening.",

"Give us an ending - c'mon, man!","I was stunned to see, as various threads wind toward final conclusion in this story, that Konkoly neither finished it at the end, nor has written a  final installment. As far as I can tell “Book 6” is just the box set of the first five (“Omega” being the fifth)...He’s come up with a couple of novellas, one with Daniel Petrovich’s back story and another detailing a Black Flag mission in Uruguay alluded to here in “Omega”, but this is too good a series not to finish, and certainly not this close to the end. I'm docking him a star for failing to finish the series. I'll revise this and give him back the fifth star here, if he ever does...C’mon, man!..Here, our characters pick up the trail of rogue Russian scientist Anatoly Reznikov, designer of a dangerous virus already used to attack the US and Russia...Two years earlier, Russian mobsters broke Reznikov out of a thought-to-be-secure CIA facility, where he was being interrogated by Karl Berg...His trail now suddenly reappears. A joint US-Russian covert strike against a secret lab in India destroys it - but barely misses Reznikov. Who tipped him? Who busted him out? Who’s got him now? What’s he up to? The US and Russia both seemed to want Reznikov, an embarrassment, forgotten...Berg knows the world won’t be safe until Reznikov is dead. Meanwhile he picks up the scent of a scary plot on the homefront. It might involve Reznikov, but it’s way bigger than just him...There’s a whole lot for Konkoly to finish here. At the end (sorry for any spoilers, but too bad) we’ve got Reznikov just having been smuggled into a secret underground lab a la “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul”.  We’ve got evidence of a secret army formed by a private security firm as, we suspect, a cutout for the new administration...The Petroviches are back in the fight, and while Berg and the Black Flaggers think they’ve finally left, they return having just honey-trapped (one of Jessica’s superpowers, along with knife fighting) a top White House official...Most of Black Flag’s gunslingers have been wiped out in an ambush that the new administration probably ordered. A top secret Russian group had been dispatched to kill Sanderson - but he talks their leader into cooperating instead...Have both governments now decided they want Reznikov back in business? Are they cooperating? Why?..It’ll be up to the Petroviches and Sanderson’s handful of survivors, led by the deeply wounded Berg and Audra Bauer, to suss out the Ajax Conspiracy, find Reznikov and somehow kill the whole thing off before it kills them...C’mon, man!",
"Great biography of ""Mr. Cub""","Ron Rapoport has done an outstanding job of chronicling the life and career of ""Mr. Cub,"" Ernie Banks. This book has the perfect blend of personal and baseball-related stories and shows the reader what a great player--and person--Ernie Banks was. I highly recommend this book for any baseball fan. Even if you don't care for the Chicago Cubs, you'll still enjoy this book.",

This is worth reading if your are interested in Kentucky History,"Other than the Frontiersmen, this is the only book on Simon Kenton I could find that is aimed at adults.  Obviously written by a relative and somewhat biased and exaggerated, still good due to the pre-PC date of publishing.  The indians don't get cut a lot of slack and they don't deserve it.",
... attention when I ordered this book and I'm so glad I wasn't as it says it's for kids,I wasn't paying attention when I ordered this book and I'm so glad I wasn't as it says it's for kids. I enjoyed doing the whole book and playing with the colors. Everyone will enjoy it and the flowers turn out great. I'm going to put some on my sliding glass door to keep the wild birds from trying to come through it. I also shared some with friends in South Africa. They are so easy to color and look great when your done.,
Not a fan,Was not a fan. Some of the exercises were very juvenile.,
One of my favorite books of all time,"Such delight. We get to see different stages of Erik's life since his birth and learn what he has learned and done, and where he lived until he becomes the famous Opera Ghost. The book is divided into multiple parts with different POVs. It's never dull. The rhythm of the story is full of detail and emotion. It never disappoints...Not many books make me cry. This was one of them. How I longed for a book like this for a long time. This one has taken the place that Wuthering Heights occupied for years. And Erik is right there besides Heathcliff. I love a villainous and dark main character..The perfect book for Phantom of the Opera fans.",

They were easy with normal ingredients. No diet recipes here folks, just good comfort food.",

H2O2 - Medical Miracel,I fond this book to be technical compared to The One-Minute Cure: The Secret to Healing Virtually All Diseases. It purports IV administration and frowns on ingestion of H2O2.  I actually preferred The One-Minute Cure: The Secret to Healing Virtually All Diseases.,
4.5 – A Fantastic Heartwrenching YA Paranormal Romance,"Summoner by S.D. Grimm surprised me in so many ways and it was pretty fantastic! To be honest, this book was not what I expected it to be, but that turned out to be a really good thing...Grimm’s writing is beautiful, evocative, and had a nice flow that made it easy to read. The premise is intriguing and had me hooked from the very first page. I thought the idea of witching and summoning spirits was quite fascinating and I wanted to know more about it. The plot is fast-paced and full of action. The mystery, suspense, and danger had me holding my breath a few times and I absolutely loved it!..The characters are so well written and realistic. I liked Allie from the start and I understood her reasons for doing what she did. Cody is very caring and kind that seeing him so guilt-ridden was distressing. Both Allie and Cody are dealing with their own losses and struggling with grief that my heart completely broke for them. It just seemed so right that they would find comfort in each other. While there was an instant attraction between Allie and Cody, I thought their chemistry felt genuine and real. Watching them help each other heal and develop a playful and sweet relationship was so satisfying. Their bantering and flirting made me smile and swoon so much.... instalove or not, I totally ship Allie and Cody and I rooted for them the entire time...Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love that Summoner is not your typical young adult paranormal romance. There’s definitely the supernatural fantasy aspect, the mysterious hard to resist hot guy, and plenty of adorable flirting. BUT more than that, this book deals with difficult real life issues. Grimm does a terrific job portraying the sadness of losing someone you love and the agony of living with guilt. She shows how healing and learning to forgive yourself are not that easy and will take time. I really wasn’t expecting this to be deeply affecting or heartbreaking, but that’s what makes this story brilliant and so powerful. And yes… I absolutely recommend that everyone pick this up!..I received an advanced reader copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a fair review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.",
Hands On Math,"This is a great book for using the Common Core in the classroom. Great activities for students to really get a deep understanding of mathematical processes.

The lesson to express gratitude for the simple yet wonderfully miraculous things in life from kittens purrs, and sloppy dog kisses to pancakes with syrup and a sky full of stars can not be taught at too young an age and is a lesson that we all can benefit from even as adults...Marijan Ramljak's perfectly warm and cozy illustrations are a perfect match to Amy Parker's beautiful message and never grow boring.  This book is a wonderful tool to instill the habit of thankfulness while at the same time enjoying snuggly, cuddly, beautiful together time with your little one...NOTE: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.",

Tons of info!,"The DSLR Filmmakers Handbook isn't your typical run of the mill quick guide, it's a DSLR text book.  With chapters on all the stages of production, as well as equipment, this book has it all.  Speaking from a novice's perspective, this book is exactly what I need right now! The language used in the passages is 'every day' and easy to understand.  The text is easy to read, pictures are clear, and the overall page layouts are simple to follow.  One of the nicest things about this book is that it references current cameras on the market.  While this will make this edition of the book obsolete in a year, it is very handy now.  It cemented my thoughts that the camera I'm looking into purchasing is the camera for me and raised my confidence a bit that I really could master something like a DSLR for video!..While this book isn't something I'd carry in my camera bag (too big, too weighty), it is something that will definitely come in handy while I learn to prep and use a DSLR in my future video shoots.  If you are looking to get into the professional DSLR video world and want to teach yourself the basics on up, then this is something to look into.  It is definitely worth the money!",
So glad this is available to the general public!,"I LOVE Mrs. Wishy-Washy.  I used many of Joy Cowley's books when I taught Kindergarten.

I am now at home with my 3 year old twins and 15 month old daughter and was so excited to see this book in our bookstore one day.  I thought they were only available through Rigby reading programs.  Anyhow, I bought it as soon as I saw it and my twins love it!  It is a wonderful predictable book and is great for teaching some pre-reading skills as well as just enjoying the story.

"&quot;Part beauty mark, part brand, a legacy of tribal values.&quot;","In this poignant and sometimes melancholy account of the passing of an era, Mira Kamdar tells the story of her beloved grandmother Motiba, a woman from the agrarian and pastoral culture of old Gujarat, showing how the changes in Motiba's life and family during the past seventy years are also emblematic of dramatic changes in Indian culture as a whole.  Herself the daughter of Motiba's son Prabhakar (Pete) and Lois Christensen, the Danish-American cowgirl he married while a student in the United States in the 1960's, Kamdar is especially sensitive to nuances of culture, and she brings her Indian family to life within the context of the country's history--her grandparents' marriage, her grandfather's adoption of the values of Mahatma Gandhi, the emigration of the family to Burma to manage their businesses there in the 1930's, the bombing of Rangoon by the Japanese during World War II, the return to Bombay, and eventually, the emigration of several of Motiba's children to the United States..As she describes her own life, the author shifts her focus to that of the American immigrant experience.  The tales of Indian history which infused her life as a child visiting in India eventually give way completely to tales of her life in the United States, as she moves with her parents and siblings throughout the west following her father's job changes.  The significance of the death of Gandhi on her grandmother's life yields its place to the effects of the death of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King on her parents' and her own life.  Her father's desire to have his family &quot;fit in&quot; becomes more important to him than teaching them the language and culture in which he grew up..Rich, warm, humorous, and earnest, Motiba's Tattoos recreates the universal story of an immigrant family's metamorphosis from one whose primary allegiance is to another culture to one in which opportunities to assimilate are recognized and embraced.  In the process of becoming American, uniquely personal values may evolve and be treasured, while retention of the old traditions must become a conscious effort.  What was an integral part of their family life, historically, evolves into pleasant memories and echoes of the old way of life as new generations appear--the final result of the Indian diaspora, which began in the mid-20th century and which continues, unabated, to the present day.

Yes,Perfecto,
"Still good, although the fictional parts are perhaps less believable","First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 31st May..I very much liked the previous novel about King Edwin, Oswald’s predecessor and nephew, by the same author. This one picks up and continues the story but with Oswald as the main character. As has been mentioned a number of times by many, little is known about the historical character of Oswald, but he has been a major source of inspiration, starting with Tolkien, and this book’s subtitle (Return of the King) hints at...There is much to commend in this book, but also some things that did not work well for me...Among the positive elements are the influence on Oswald and the political role played by the monastery of Iona, and its abbot Ségéne (a historical character) who do seem to have supported the Northumbrian’s bid for the throne with a contingent of armed monks and his fight against Cadwallon, despite the latter being a Celt. His reward was to replace the Roman Church with the Celtic one. The monk Aidan, who does seem to have Oswald’s friend, did become bishop and founded Lindinsfarne with the King’s support...The political relations between the various kingdoms are just as well-presented as they were in the previous volume on Edwin, whether these were Celtic, Angles or Saxons. Of particular interest is the attitude of the Briton King of Rheged. While the personality of this king might be fictional, his behaviour - he was ready to side against Cadwallon King of Gwynedd in order maintain his own independence and prevent the Welsh king from becoming too powerful although both were Britons – seems to have been fairly typical of the period and shared among most Kings, irrespective of their origins...On a different note, the description of the ex-Roman fortress of Carlisle, the seat of the King of Rheged’s power, is well-done and particularly interesting, just as that of the derelict fortifications of Hadrian’s Wall near which Oswald fought his decisive battle against Cadwallon...Another particularly good feature, which could perhaps have been developed even more, is to show to what extent Oswald relied on his younger brother (and future successor) Oswiu and how the two “shared the work” between them. This is probably one of the main reasons that allowed the Northumbrians lead by Oswiu to conquer Goddodin and take the fortress of Edinburgh while Oswald was holding Northumbria together. It is also this “division of labour” that allowed them to repel Penda’s attack on East Anglia without fear of being attacked in turn on another front by one of the other kings...Another good set of features are the inclusions of glossary, map, list of the main characters, a note on pronunciation and a few pages summarising the main events of Edwin’s reign. I found these features particularly helpful to follow the intrigue and complex relationships and marriage alliances between the various kingdoms and pretenders to the various crowns. The little summary of the previous book is particularly helpful for anyone reading this one without the benefit of having read the first title. This allows Oswald to be read as a stand-alone book, as opposed to most series...I liked this book, found it an exciting read, and could not put it down. I did however have three problems the author’s fictional choices. One was that I found some of them hard to believe or even bordering on the caricature. While I will refrain from elaborating too much in order to avoid spoilers, I got the impression at times that the book was about Oswald the dutiful Saint, Cadwallon the delusional, and Penda the treacherous...Cadwallon’s portrait was particularly difficult to believe. While Cadwallon does seem to have tried to portray himself as the returning Arthur and this may have turned out to be a political blunder because it alienated other British Kings, he is shown in this book as whining, delusional and even cowardly, rather than the crafty and powerful ruler that he probably was and who over-reached, with his last gamble goinf badly wrong...Another point is that there is nothing to confirm Oswald’s inner desire to retire from the world and become a monk, or his ascetic behaviour. There were quite a few other reasons than these for making him into a Saint shortly after his death, including his care for the poor and destitute, which seems to have been genuine. The supposed tension between Oswald and his younger brother, and the source of this tension, also seem to have been invited by the author while this is the first time I have ever heard of Penda having also a brother...While what happened to Oswald’s body is drawn from the sources, his death may not have been caused by the elaborate and somewhat complicated plot contained in the book. A much simpler explanation was that Oswald and his followers were on a raiding expedition and got caught far from their base. Cornered and badly outnumbered, they were destroyed, which is something that happened quite frequently given the kind of warfare that was taking place at the time...Finally, there is again the question of numbers on each side when describing the various battles between the military households of the various warlords. Here again, the author has chosen a minimalist approach with “armies” in the very low hundreds at most, or even less than a hundred. While there is no way to be sure whether this is exaggerated or not, I cannot help thinking that it would be somewhat difficult to form a shield wall with only eighty warriors. Here again, however, as with the author’s characterisation, this is about perceptions and personal preferences more than anything else so that I will rate this book four stars, despite slightly preferring the first volume...Again, for those wanting to check historical elements or learn more about Oswald on the one hand and warfare during these times on the other, I can recommend Max Adams’ “King of the North”, which is about much more than Oswald and also covers the reign of his uncle Edwin and Guy Halsall’s “Warfare and Society in the Barbarian West (450-900).",
required for my class,"Horrible to read. This book is difficult to understand and the problems are confusing. I am pretty comfortable with Microeconomics, but this book is not clear at all. Wouldn't recommend, if you have an option!",
Haven't read it yet,So what can I write in this review except that I've looked at other books by the same author and they seem to be something I can stomach reading so I thought I'd give this book a try and maybe learn a little physics in the process.,
Great book,I try to read the books my kids are reading and my ten year old was reading this. He finished it in one day. I didn't really want to read it but  as soon as I started I was hooked. It moved at a good speed and was fun and clever. I just ordered the other two and we will see if my son beats me to the mailbox.,
Five Stars,Very interesting read.,
My favorite. A good courtroom novel about a good guy lawyer.,I am already downloading Michael Stagg’s second novel in this series. A touch of John Grisham with a lot of heart and an enjoyable read.,
A must have,This is a beautiful done book.  The pictures are well drawn on nice quality paper.  This is a hardcover book that comes with a attached ribbon as a bookmark.  I highly recommend getting this.,

GREAT book!,Beautiful!  You won't be disappointed with this book.  ALL ages enjoy reading this book.  I can't say enough about it.  My family has thoroughly enjoyed using this book during our own monarch adventures.,
Great book. Even though it is a children's book,"Great book.  Even though it is a children's book, it is quite entertaining for adults as well.  You can really feel her emotions and thinking.  Was a wonderful listen with the family.  Glad she is writing more.",
Five Stars,Thank you,
great bargain,"have not read it, but all Tom Clancy novels are great, especially the Ryan ones.  Book received in like new condi]tion.",
Loved it,"I have been waiting for this author to release this book and I am happy to say that she did not disappoint me with this story...Wow, this book was amazing! I absolutely loved the twisted story-line. It makes me think twice about meeting a stranger. This author has a magnificent way of writing stories that keeps you glued from beginning to end. I highly recommend this story to all paranormal lovers who loves a good and twisted short story. This is one story I will re-read over and over again...I received a Smashwords copy, in return for an honest review.",
Hilarious Yet Inspirational,"Content wise this was another fantastic entry into the Assassination Classroom universe. It does well at giving us lots of fun and games for the students to develop them a bit more. Rather than focusing on many assassination plots, we instead get one major event while the rest focuses on development key students (like Terasaka) or enhancing our experience with their relationship with each other and with students in the main class. This is done with comedy in mind but an underlying theme of students wanting to rise from their low state and reach their full potential. It is inspirational...I do have to ding some points for the volume, there were about two instances of typos in the text or just weird grammar. Additionally there were no extras beyond an afterward and the usual in between chapter inserts. Though the inserts this time were quite hilarious. The slime one is probably the one that people will find most memorable...All in all Assassination Classroom has not lost any of its steam since its debut and is still one of the best manga in Viz's Lineup.",
Wonderful book for dads to read to their children.,This book is a great one for dads to read to their children. I am also glad there are books with diverse peoples in them.,
Great story for young readers,My five year old loves this story and reads it over and over.,
Hello gate,"Good book.  Better have your mind open and think outside the box.  I enjoyed reading this real late at night, real late. Hope everyone enjoys this as well. Thanks",

So fun,Loved the set up for the next series. Love all these characters,
CT you had me from the beginning in your corner and Ida Sue made me want to have you come fix things at my house. Lol,"This book was phenomenal start to finish with some of the best one LINERS I have ever read and the things Ida Sue comes up with had me rolling and laughing..Titan is our one and only CT who wakes up in Vegas to discover that in a drunken stupor has married a lady who, although was hot, he doesn't want to stay married to. He has other commitments to take care of, and a wayward wife doesn't fit into these commitments..Our darlin female is not happy when she wakes up and realises she is married to Titan AKA Big Daddy and does what most females do when we have messed up, she runs. Fast and far away. But can you ever really run from your problems?.These two are the perfect couple when they work their issues out and the interactions they have together are pure gold and will have you laughing until you become teary eyed. Throw in our Ida Sue and other family members and it makes for one kick butt new edition to the ever increasing awesomeness that is our Jordan Marie..I won't say there wasn't some bumps in the road for the couple's HEA,  but never was there a time that you felt the story was dragging or that you wished it would just hurry up and end. To me the exact opposite was going on. I was so hooked that I read as fast as I could to get to the next interaction with CT and Ida Sue, because they were off the charts funny..THIS author get a better with everything she writes and is so into her supporters that it gives me great privilege to read and review her books..Highly recommend this newest book and can't wait for the next one.",
So far so good but the print is the tiniest ever!!!,I like it so far. I just hope my eyesight can holdout. This paperback has the smallest print known to mankind. Maybe the hardcover is better.,
Skip the Sequel,"I happened across Finney's Time and Again and it was a delight...highly original, vivid in its descriptions of 19th century New York with an engaging plot and characters. This sequel is a messy follow-up that is just too forced. One of its characters states that he dislikes the word ""nostalgia"" but that is what this whole effort communicates. Finney gets tied up in a cloying, irritating homage to simpler times that is meandering and uninteresting. I wish I had not picked it up and had only the memory and experience of the first book. One interesting item of note, I believe Stephen King was influenced by one thing that takes place in From Time to Time...the main character hums and sings a song from his future era which causes his wife concern. That same ploy was used in King's 11/22/63.",
This is one fantastic book! Buy the Kindle version or the hardcover ...,"This is one fantastic book!.Buy the Kindle version or the hardcover version-now..Life is all about &#34;using the fine china and silverware.&#34;..This book will tell you things about these men and the men that lived when they lived that you will not believe..I will not go into specifics about this masterpiece-that would be very rude.  I would be taking away from the reader things that you must read for yourself.  If you love human nature,airplanes, and all things aviation buy this book.  I was unable to put it down.  We owe them a debt that we shall never be able to repay...",
Three Stars,Was very good... the ending was a bit disappointing.,
Compelling story of post-deployment re-adjustment,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this book from the publisher...This was my first book from author Drusilla Campbell.  I became easily engaged in the subject matter, the story of a woman's re-adjustment to home life after her deployment in Iraq.  Campbell's writing is engaging, and the book was a quick read.  The one issue I had is that early in the novel, it is somewhat difficult to have much empathy for main character Frankie, who comes off as quite abrasive.  The reader might be more understanding with more insight into Frankie's situation--namely, her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but this doesn't come until much later.  Still, if the reader has patience for Frankie, her story is a compelling, worthwhile read.",
Hugely disappointing,"Why this book is so highly rated is completely beyond me. This is really poorly written, even the separation of chapters makes no sense. The story is bland, the ""characters"" bland, the twists it tries to go for just seem so forced and fake. This reminds me of one of those wildly popular tv series that is really low quality but is on network tv and can appeal to the most possible people.",
Well Told Story,"Wonderful read. Bogs down a bit toward the last few chapters, but Leonard is an intriguing storyteller who compels you to keep reading. Engrossing, but not overly wrought and not intellectually taxing. I am a Jack Reacher fan, having read over 20 of Lee's books and I would put Leonard in Lee's class of authors.",
Still on my private library,"I thought maybe it had a couple of pictures in it but nope. Just words.Very complete, the information is easy to read and find.",
Super cute,Very cute,
Five Stars,Great Transaction! Awesome Merchandise!,
Typical Schlichter,"Anyone who has read Schlichter’s columns will immediately recognize the sardonic humor and political perspective represented in People’s Republic.  America has split into Red and Blue countries.  The Blues espouse all the values of the Left (gun control, abortion on demand, climate change, government run business and hardcore law enforcement).  The Reds maintain the traditional American values, it’s Constitution, free markets, personal liberties and free speech.  And you know where Schlichter takes it from there.  With dripping sarcasm, he describes life in the Blue zone pretty much as it is in Venezuela and Cuba by simply extending the existing trends of today’s Left.  His military background lends credibility to his protagonist, Kelly Turnbull (ex-Special Forces) who is hired, from time to time, by the USA to conduct secret missions behind enemy lines.  Turnbull turns out to be a stone-cold killing machine. So, Schlichter combines politics and action-adventure to create some pretty funny and entertaining stuff.  It’s not exactly Shakespeare but it will do as well as a glass of smooth scotch on a rainy day to put that warm glow in your stomach.  Now on to Indian Country.",
I just hope Vince Flynn had several more novels in ...,I just hope Vince Flynn had several more novels in the works that can be published.  I do not want to give up Mitch Rapp.,
Good Workbook,The best thing about this workbook is that it is designed to present a math problem per day as part of a practice regiment. It covers a wide range of math problems at the second grade level. It is a 36 week progressive program along with scope and sequence charts for standardized testing.  Another place that thinks about teaching math differently is  the Beestar website. It is nice to see that teaching math has changed somewhat since I was a kid. Part of a series of workbooks...Note: You will need both the teacher and student editions to get the most out of this workbook program.,
Totally enjoyed this.  Even had a twist at the end.,Really good book.  I was totally immersed in the story beginning to end.  Great mystery that had my heart racing.  Amazing what a little tune can put in motion under the right circumstances.,

"Great Guide to Ireland, Everything I Wanted","I usually get guides to get myself excited for a location and that is what I was hoping for with this one.  We have been watching groupon and budget trips and Ireland is often on the list so we wanted to know more.  And this DK guide really got our hearts pumping for a chance to visit.  That is what the DK guides do best, they expose you to so many places and photos.  It is not the best for an exhaustive list of hotels and restaurants, but it is the best for introducing you to a local...This book is filled with everything that makes me love the DK guides.  There are lots of photos, good written content, great maps and fantastic illustrations of structures and even city blocks.  We have used these guides for the US, Mexico, Italy and others and they really are my first go to guide on a area.  Highly recommend them in general, and even more so for Ireland.  We are looking to book!",
Five Stars,Very informatics,
THE BEST,"This book is both funny and complex..The characters are very alive, siblings acting from the lowest impulses and the highest intentions..The parents unconsciously doing and have done their unbridled worst....It is a fascinating plot, brilliantly executed...I simply LOVED this book as an exploration of family madness (just like mine) and a very fun read, THE BEST..",
Love It!,Amazing Book!,
Know your history,Well researched book.  Story line could use more character development. Sometimes a little too zealous in the prayer area.,
Just Five,We all just love this book and we read it all the time.,
SUCH nice quality,"I had this book for my son, who would now be in his mid 30's and he loved it. He listened to it year round. I bought it for his daughter for this Christmas!",
twist/ turn,"The descriptive writing again draws in the reader. The characters become more familiar as the story weaves to an end. You can almost feel the dreary rain and smell the spirits, both kinds. On to book three where the author perhaps will reveal the characters even more. Poetic and thoughtful!",
fairly good book,the book was very interesting but sort of dragged at the beginning.  It did pick up toward the middle and the descriptions in the jail and at the trial was very good.,
Too heavy to enjoy reading,"The few pages are printed on paper near the thickness of enameled cardboard. This makes it difficult to turn pages while holding the (very heavy) book up in your lap. Also too many ‘unknown’ reasons for many bird characteristics and activities. This one goes to our local public library for their shelf, not for my personal bird reference library.",
100% recommended,"I love it, es de lo mejor me encanta!",
Slow and lost it's way with the modern day storyline.,"If this book had simply been the story of the Duchess of Marlborough ( Gladys Spencer-Churchill), I probably would have loved it. The secondary story line with Annie and her mother, Laurel, just dragged and felt entirely irrelevant to me. Neither of those women were of any interest to me. They were in the way of the really interesting character and story - The Duchess. I found myself just skipping pages because I wasn't invested in the book and actually choosing to read other things first. The writing here isn't bad, it just wasn't a tale I could get lost in.",
Capturing,Good ending. Took me 2 weeks to read but I liked it a lot. It's a book I'd definitely recommend if you like crime thrillers.,
What a beautiful book!,This book is so clever how the raised letters fit into cutouts in the opposite page. The colors are bright large and engaging for a young child. My 2 yr old was immediately happy to sit down with me and repeatedly flip back and forth through the pages which she almost never does. She was pointing out all the letters and animals she recognized and I think yak is her new favorite word!,
Five Stars,Beautiful book for the price.,

Wisdom for Aging,A true “gift”  for all of us who are struggling with aging. Parker Palmer’s insight and wisdom prevail.,
"Not for me, but still well done....","This book is incredibly well done, as far as being a mix between Shakespeare and Mean Girls. That said, it's not for me. I take the full blame for that. I've always liked Mean Girls, even if it's out of character for me. I found myself curious about this book. When it comes to Shakespeare, though, I prefer watching his works, not reading them. This book is so well done with the Shakepeare part that I found myself, as usual with Shakespeare, just wishing I could see it as a play/movie. (It is written out like a play, which may be obvious to most.) While it's not for me, I do think if you love reading the works of Shakespeare and you love the movie Mean Girls, this book will work great for you.",
Five Stars,Adorable! Bought for 3 year old nephew and he loves it. Great quality and colorful illustrations.,
Son really love it,My son really love truck and cars so I bought this book for him and he absolutely love it. We read this every night and he already memorized all the trucks and cars in the book. I love how simple the illustrations are. Very nice book!,
The First Patient,gripping and exciting and hard to put down.  compelling all the way to the end and can't wait for the next novel,
Great for beginning independent readers.,A very easy to read bio for a school project.,
Strange Maladies for Sure,"Early on in the book I was reminded of Eric Berne's work of forty years ago...which he titled Games People Play in an attempt to describe both functional and dysfunctional social interactions...Berne described the types of social interactions. Now comes Jhumpa Lahiri with her extraordinary talent which allows her to describe how these people communicate with each other and more amazingly, what they say when they communicate with themselves...She is truly an Interpreter of Maladies and as Frederick Busch noted in his oft quoted praise of her Pulitizer.... ""Lahiri honors the vastness and variousness of the world.""..I suspect there are few people who suffer from such maladies but they need an interpreter just like everyone else, I suppose...And Ms. Lahiri is a good one.",
Fantastic read,This book surprised me within a few chapters! The plot is truly amazing and I cannot wait to read the sequel...outstanding author!,
Exploring worlds you never knew existed,This is an absolutely delightful and entertaining book. Great if you like math but intriguing even if math doesn't come easy. Each chapter takes you on a journey exploring worlds you may never knew existed. It is written in an engaging style that keeps you interested even when the math gets a bit overwhelming. Would recommend to anyone with average or above average intelligence and curiosity.,
Great Reading! Can't wait for the next book!,"Great fantasy story with a strong female character that develops throughout the story into a powerful woman.

"Cool science, awesomely conflicted and sympathetic heroine, and a movie-worthy visual adventure.","4.5 stars, actually...MR Carey writes graphic novels/comics in his other writerly incarnation, and the influence of this on this YA future dystopian horror/fantasy is that you are immediately, visually, and viscerally drawn into the story...Although my middle school daughter did not finish the book. So there's that half star the book doesn't get...I was thinking about the difference in our reactions to the beginning of the book (daughter: &#34;what's going on? Who is she? Why do they point a gun at her? Why are the adults so mean?&#34; and me: Ooo, look what Carey is doing here by setting up Melanie as our POV character in the beginning, he can make us entirely sympathetic to Melanie and her girl-crush on her teacher Ms Justineau while at the same time give massive hints to readers familiar with the paranormal fantasy tropes of what exactly the reason is that everyone treats her like garbage and she isn't let out into the outside world) and I think its based on the fact that I am a long-time fantasy/sci fi fan and so pretty much immediately knew what was up with Melanie...My daughter didn't, and so the fact that the book doesn't start answering questions until about halfway through really bothered her...This is mostly a thriller and adventure-through-ruins-of-society kind of story. While Melanie is the main character, we mostly get her POV in the beginning long enough for us to get attached, and then we get shifting POV as she travels with Ms. Justineau, a scientist, and a few soldiers towards the city of Beacon. By the time the POV shifted, it was fine, I was already hooked to Melanie...Another thing that pleased me about this book was the level of science. There are medical explanations and descriptions of cool med-tech tools used in discovering those explanations for Melanie's condition that totally ring true...But the thing that stood out for me the most is that this book really delves into human relationships vis-a-vis the difference between the terrible creatures outside the gates, Melanie herself, Caldwell the cruel and detached scientist, and Ms. Justineau. What are the emotions that make us human? At what point is it worth saying &#34;humans&#34; deserve to live and win-out over other creatures if those humans are willing to perpetuate atrocities in order to do so?..And what about the fierce, uncomplicated loyalty and love between mother-figure and daughter?..Cool science, awesomely conflicted and sympathetic heroine, and a movie-worthy visual adventure.",
fun story for little children,"I bought this for my 2 adopted children and also my daycare children. It was to replace an old book that I'd had over 30 years ago, that I use to read to my 1st child. It was a favorite of hers! I'd read it so many times to her that I actually still had it memorized lol :) Read it, and enjoy!",
This one's fun!,"I am one who loves doing crytograms in the paper from time to time and have, once, bought a book of them.  I like this one a lot.  There is ample space to write the solution above the printed cypher.  The ring-bound style makes it easy to use because the book lies flat when using either side of the page.  I've done perhaps 85 of them and have found no errors.  Love the idea of giving one letter clue (used once) OR the whole answer which I've not yet used.  I'd get another book by H. Hook.",

Intriguing from jump..and keeps going,"Love characters & story of The Zone, the Red Rocks.  Timely concepts.",
Good start to an interesting series,"Ryan Graudin's &#34;Wolf by Wolf&#34; was pretty much what I expected in an YA with an alternate history where the Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan won WWII. Yael is the lead character as a survivor of the camps and experimentation, she enters the annual Axis Tour which is a motorcycle race to celebrate the victories of the world war...Putting the time in the mid-50s was a great idea and adding in the 'extra powers' will probably be something that younger readers will like (although I admit that I could have done without it). Yael has a mission though and that is to assassinate Hitler and both the race and the mission create tension enough to keep my attention...The pace was surprisingly slow but I still enjoyed the story overall. This is the first book of the series and it was a good start.",
Five Stars,My daughters very favorite book. I've read it a good 100 times now.,
I don't like short stories,"In general, I don't like short stories. They're usually frustrating because they're over before I can really get to know the characters. However, I read all of these.and was satisfied by most of them.",
Some sweet faces,"I like most of the patterns, some I would change the colors a little. The cover pattern is the most color balanced of all the patterns. There are two patterns that I really like and plan to stitch so it was a good purchase.",
Uneven but worth the read,"Verso was running a sale on their site, so I went ahead and bought this due to my love both of Bohemians and Graphic novels. Overall, it was an interesting book, with biographical info about some people I was familiar with and people I learned about for the first time. The only issue is that there is an unevenness to each of the stories in terms of quality of the art and the research that went into the story. For example, there is an example where the cartoonist is showing the Panama Canal (P. 11) - in a story that takes place prior to the digging of the canal. Little things like that in a book about history make you wonder what is wrong about what you don’t know. That said, the extended piece on Woody Guthrie makes it worth it for me.",

It tells you which essential oils to use not just for eczema but for a lot of different things like; diaper rash,cough, fever, muscle aches, motion sickness , just to name a few.",
Yoga book,Lovely,
I couldn't finish it,"It wasn't the fault of the book, necessarily; it could be that I was getting into a series in the middle and didn't have the background. The basic plot--the mysterious deaths of people involved in an auto accident--had to be accepted for the book to be enjoyed, and I thought it was far-fetched. Again, I'm not blaming the author; that's why I'm giving it three stars in a sort of share-the-blame idea; I think it would have been better if I had been able to get into the book before the murders started. My only recommendation to anyone reading this book as his first Roy Grace consider reading the books that came before first.",
Satisfying read,"This is a very involved, expertly crafted tale of dependency, love, mystery and celebrity. #darkcircles kept me interested and excited to see what happened next. I felt the ending was satisfactory and found it to have a little twist with the title..I received a copy of this from #netgalley and the publisher, the review is my own.",
Not one boring sentence and the action never stops.  Great!,"I love true stories about adventures in faraway places.  And this fine book certainly meets that test.  Kelly James gives us a short introductory chapter in which she describes her upbringing on a ranch in the American northwest.  She was raised to ride and shoot and live with adventure.  Soon, she realized she didn't want to be relegated to a typical female role in life.  And so she became a private investigator and has traveled all over the world in a wide variety of international business investigations.  Mostly, she works in Africa and the book is comprised of four separate stories about a few unique assignments...Her writing style is fast-paced, breezy and has the sense of adventure that obviously drives her life.  There's not one boring sentence in the whole book and the action never stops.  I read these stories with the kind of attention that kept me breathless and turning the pages as something new happens on every page.  And my sense of wonder at her bravery and willingness to take risks never ceased.  I just couldn't stop reading  and was sorry when this 235-page book ended...In the first story she investigates a mysterious death of a wealthy plantation owner.  In the second story she travels into the depths of gorilla country.  In the third story she helps a young man visit his war-torn land.  And, in the last story, she is hired to investigate a young female African doctor's disappearance.  Often, she fines herself in  personal danger and has is forced to survive in a very hostile environment.  Each one of these stories kept my eyes glued to the page.  I couldn't put the book down until they were finished...""Dancing With the Witchdoctor"" was a mini-adventure for me.  It brought me to places I've only dreamed of visiting and made me identify with the author's courage, stamina and sense of adventure.  For me, reading this book was like being picked up by a whirlwind and experiencing the trip of my life.  I loved it!..Highly recommended.",
Little House By Boston Bay,"Although not written by Ingalls, Little House By Boston Bay continues in the spirit of her books.  This time it centers on Charlotte, the grandmother of Laura Ingalls Wilder.  It is the first book in the series and starts when Charlotte is almost five years old...Most of the book details Charlotte's life and the almost year that it covers.  Most notably, this book takes place during the War of 1812 and so there is quite a bit of information included in there; especially a copy of the Star Spangled Banner and other songs.  Charlotte's days are filled with chores and playing with her new doll whom she has trouble naming.  She also goes to school and meets a new friend named Susan and even tries to go to Scotland (although she doesn't realize how far away it is.)  She listens to her mother's stories and helps with setting the table with her special ""Saturday Family"" (jars, bottles and etc. with condiments for the table)...The characters in this book are mostly well written.  I do think that Charlotte, being 4-5 in this book, sounds a little too old and mature for the age.  But times were different back then so I could be wrong.  Her brothers and sisters are present but not really developed too much; the same goes for her father.  Where the characters really shine though is her mother.  Her mother is a bright personality with a lot of oomph in her and there is quite a bit of detail written about her...Wiley has a nice writing style and it is somewhat similar in style to Wilders.  She adds the same element of almost a diary type of writing as the other Little Houses' do, but doesn't have as much useful information within the pages.  Out of everything that is described, it is not done in a way that makes me think I could repeat it like I could with the original series.  However, there is a recipe for pounded cheese that almost seems doable by reading the description.  This is a great book for kids and reading it at my age is probably why I find more fault with it in this regards.  It is a simple story about a girl and her life...Not my favorite of the whole grouping of books but it wasn't bad either.  The whole series from Laura's stories, to her mothers, and so-on are a charming group of books.  They are perfect for cozying up by a fire and reading with your children, or even by yourself for reminiscing...Little House By Boston Bay.Copyright 1999.195 pages..Review by M. Reynard 2010",
A Good Read But a Few Quibbles,"The first 3/4 of the audiobook are amazing.  Creative.  Well-written, fast paced and funny.  Then it devolves into Starship Troopers which carries on to book 2 of the series.  I enjoyed it but will stop with book 2.  A huge complaint and probably not the author's fault.  Every quote ends with ""he said"" or ""she said.""  Even in a two person conversation where it is painfully obvious who is speaking.  Maybe ok in written form but in an audiobook becomes like nails on the chalkboard.  It's the equivalent to talking to a person who says ""you know"" after ever other word.  That said, I enjoyed the book and the narrator is excellent.",

Five Stars,Excellent source book for writers.,
Great Suspense and Characters!,I love the suspense and mystery!!  Awesome book!  I am ready them all!!,
Good start to a promising conclusion,"3.5 stars … this is a fairly new author to me; I like her dark and depraved imagination and the blurb definitely hooked me in. I read yellow thorns which is actually the first 3 chapters of this book rather than a teaser to whet your appetite of what was to come so I did feel a little cheated here...Continuing on… the story had great potential. Plenty of crumbs dropped at secrets and current events in the plot that I thoroughly enjoyed. It’s a typical NA bully type romance; one girl on the out and bullied by the mean girls. My heart instantly went out to Naomi but the character was strong and was able to hold her own which I enjoyed. Giving the proverbial middle finger to anyone that tries to belittle her...Along comes the star quarterback, the hot guy everyone wants. Whilst he had my attention; once he set his sights on Naomi it’s like a switch flipped on his personality so I felt it was missing development here. Then for the next 50% of the book it’s about the chase / the protests and what happens when he catches her. This I thought went on for far too long. It was unnecessary filler. Great dark, depraved raw sex but way too much. It brought nothing further to the story IMO and the plot didn’t really develop and was spent solely on these two characters. Once we got past this it was back to the plot that I was invested in...The last 20% had me hooked and kept me invested enough to want to know the answers and what’s in store for these characters. Without reading part 2; I think this could easily have been made a decent length standalone story.",
"If you must pick one, choose this one!","Out of the two Nina Guerrera series books I’ve read so far, this one was by far the show stopper. The first book was phenomenal and set the scene for the second novel beautifully. I tore through this one in a day, absolutely astonishing!",
Excellent story line,Enjoyed reading the story.  Hit close to home with incidents between Russia and US underwater encounters.,
Great story & thriller,"I really enjoyed the first book in the series and looked forward to the hunky buffed up Chief of Police's story. Leigh didn't disappoint and the heroine was funny, brace and definitely no damsel.",

"""A Red Menace in Beautiful Venice!""","I found this book on an Amazon Kindle special, and I was pleasantly surprised!  ""Red Blitz"" is the first work by James Raven I have read, and I know I shall try another.  The terrorism theme in the book is sadly becoming more and more plausible in today's world; I think if I had read this 20 years or so ago, its ""realism"" would not have been as great as it is today.  In the first few chapters, we discover that dozens of bombs have been hidden throughout Venice by a terrorist who is found dead.  But, as time quickly passes, things are not quite what they appear to be...The story line was good; it was not the most challenging story I've read, but it was enjoyable and kept your interest. It is more of a novella than a fully developed novel - about 150 pages, but once you get reading, the pages turn faster and faster and suddenly you are done. Still, the plot was original, and the pace certainly drove the action along. The setting of Venice is beautiful and inspired. The characterization was good, and there were some well-rounded, nicely thought out characters. The shortness of the story limited some character development which would have strengthened the book. I especially liked the central character of  Armond Cali who is the current leader of Venice paramilitary police force, known as the Carabinieri. His character did actually seem like one who could evolve in another story.  I did struggle over three or four stars due mainly to the ""shortness"" of the story; I felt that more develop in story line and character would have helped.  However, due to the gripping, innovative nature of the plot which did create a ""page turner,"" I gave it four stars.  ""Red Blitz"" is a tense ""thriller"" which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre.",
Wonderful!,"The only reason this got 4/5 stars is I had no idea it was a total cliff hanger... the WORST kind of cliff hanger.... so I read it in one night then was left going... ummmm, what?! :( So, be warned!",
A Long Read: Spoiler Alert! Something Very Important That Might Ruin Your Read,"Okay, people who read my reviews on Amazon know what's coming. I hate &#34;true stories&#34; or historical pieces that are not TRUE...I was enjoying this book very much though at times it gets a little 'made up' sounding. Almost like the writer is sort of winging it. So, about 3/4ths through, I start doing some research only to discover the whole thing is a fabrication. It's a lie. Well, so what if it's a good story? That can be up to you. For me, it confirmed what I was sensing in the writing. This guy just wasn't there. It's all made up...From then on, it was very hard to read on knowing it was all a fake.  Then I hit the chapter on their encounter with the abominable snow man. (Snow People? 8' tall!)  Okay, that was just over the top nonsense...It is a fun listen if you don't care or don't know it's a complete fake. Except for some of the totally outlandish nonsense...I am being generous with the stars. The story is pretty good. It's a decent hoax. But it isn't a super-human feat of survival.",
Five Stars,for grand daughter,
Eh,Got this because it was required by professor. So many mistakes and the book seems to be written by someone not in the medical profession. A lot of made up words.,
NOT YOUR TYPICAL EXPAT STORY,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked the way the author Justine Vander Leun has the ability to beautifully detail her experiences in a foreign land through her keen perceptions and skillful writing. But at times, I felt that the writing was dull and uneventful. This is definitely not your typical expat book that Frances Mayes and Peter Mayle have made so popular. The author writes about her love for a dog that she meets and ends up naming it Marcus before she realizes that he is actually a she! That part is very heartwarming but at times sad. She chronicles her new life with her Italian boyfriend Emanuele and his family noting some major differences between her previous life in New York City and Collelungo, a rural Umbrian town of just 200 inhabitants. I finished the book, but I can't say that I couldn't wait to get to the next page. I would have liked to see the tempo of this book picked up a bit.",
Like Indiana Jones 4 or the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy some things just are necessary.,"Decent story. But like all sequels, especially to any groundbreaking story, this has a hard time living up to the first. Miller manages to create a good enough plot for the book, but the layout of the panels is all over the place. The art is a little bit off and the coloring by Varley is usually breathtaking, but not in this case. there are certain pages where you cannot tell for the life of you what exactly is going on. Frank Miller is by no means a bad artist, this book just needed alot more careful planning and better structure. If he is going to do a DK3 there's going to be much more painstaking attention to detail this time...I'd give it a 5.5/10 for a slightly compelling story that is worth reading (IMO) but not worth the fuss of The Dark Knight Returns.",
Get it!,"My youngest son wanted some Shonen Jump- very cool selection of manga and it's become quite popular with the kids. This is a great collection of stories, articles, etc. And it's in the traditional Japanese ""back to front"" format to boot! A definite must have, and a great price. :o)",
Very little information about the title character,"This book provides very little information about the title character, and nothing much at all until the last chapter.  Instead, it is a poorly-written, repetitive and jumpy history of the Chinese in America.  The author repeats himself frequently, puts quotes around phrases which do not require it, and recounts anecdotes in a way that makes them boring and irritating.  I felt I was fighting with this book all the way.  The title subject was illiterate and lived a very isolated existence, so there are nothing more than secod-hand accounts and speculation about her.  Even her real name is not known.",

And yet in its darkest recesses we are given hope, possibilities of light to come shinning through to give us a glimpse that humanity still hangs on by a thread. That life is still worth fighting for...We are plunged into the darkest recess of human nature. A man who knows only cruelty, murder and yet some thread of goodness still remains. Love is a powerful tool that can and does change a person. This is a story the reader will remember for a long time after the last page has been closed. The characters remain to linger in your soul and their story one that wont easily be forgotten.",
Great content put pricey,Lots of great content in this law book.  The cases are very useful.  I probably should have rented it as it was pretty expensive but thought this may be a book that will be useful to have in the future.,
Forgot how much I loved her books!,Just amazing twists and turns. Takes place in Scotland and Italy. Centered around the miners troubles in Scotland in 1984. She has such a way of pulling you into the story and the fascinating descriptions of the politics of relationships. Not typical boring murders either which makes it even better!,
Nice,Love it,
Heart-wrenching,"I just finished reading this book on Kindle.  I must say that after reading the first few pages, I had to put it down and deal with some strong emotions that I began to experience.  It brought back some unpleasant memories of my own.  Although I didn't experience or even imagine abuse to this degree, I can sympathize and grieve with her.  It is very touching and so tragic.  It really makes me so upset and angry with any person who could treat another living thing with such cruelty and anger and hatred.  All types of abuse are forever hurtful!  Thank you for sharing your experiences so that it can be brought out into the light, and we can all learn something from it, and take action when we must!..Reading the book, I am happy that Sarah is doing well, is a loving and caring person, and has loving and caring family surrounding her!  Healing from this and other abuse can possibly never be complete.  It's difficult to forgive and forget...but when we do, it sets us free.  To try to understand how or why someone could treat another person, let alone their own child, in such a horrible way...it's almost impossible.  I have spent many years trying to understand.  I think it's even worse when the abuser denies that it ever happened.  I only now realized there is a first book.  I'm glad to know that this sad and frightening tale has a happy ending.  Yay for you, Sarah!!  Blessings to you and your family!  Much Love!",
Excellent series. Well written.,"The entire Dresden Files series are very well written. They are exciting, humorous in the narrators self deprecating way, and very inventive. If you need a primer on all the goules, vampires, werewolfs, ghosts, demons, fairy folk, trolls, etc., this is the series to read...I actually buy the hardcover when it comes out, as I can't wait for the paperback.",

Clinton as a life example,"If you have not read much about Hillary Clinton's life this book will give you some idea of how she got to where she is today. It is mostly full of the author's take on leadership and life habits. These are good ideas, and she uses Clinton's attributes as a springboard for how one could apply it to one's life. A short book, easy to read and fairly well written. I may have been looking for something else, but the book left me a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it is due to my impression of the Clinton era lacking a good legacy, and an opportunity clearly wasted.",

“Every ugly toad thinks that sooner or later he is going to get to eat the meat of a swan.”,"Mai Jia, a popular novelist and winner of the Mao Dun Literature Prize, China’s highest literary honor, writes here under a pen name after serving for seventeen years as a member of the People’s Liberation Army and its intelligence services. Decoded, originally written and published for a Chinese audience in 2002, and newly translated and published in English, provides a fascinating study of cryptography and its dedicated cryptographers, many of whom give their lives (and even their sanity) to their work.  The exciting and revelatory translation by Olivia Milburn and Christopher Payne provides new insights into worlds that have been closed to most of us, not just the hidden world of cryptography and the psychological toll it takes on those who dedicate their lives to it, but also the world of the People’s Republic of China and the thinking of many of its people...Astonishing in its focus on the travails and inner torments of one major character, Rong Jinzhen, the novel features a psychological, individualized approach, something I did not expect for characters living within the group culture of China, especially among characters from the army and its secret intelligence services. An orphan who grows up within two adoptive homes, Rong Jinzhen, known in childhood as “Duckling,” is a mathematical genius, called “Idiot Savvy” in school, but he never stops feeling isolated and apart, however praised he might be for his brilliance and dedication to intellectual goals.  He counts ants, the days that his “Daddy” has lived on earth before his death at age eighty-eight, invents his own multiplication tables, and becomes a chess player at the highest level of competition...The older and more dedicated he becomes to what he is learning, however, the more preoccupied – even autistic – he becomes.  With his lively mind focused totally on intellectual goals, he evokes our concern as he fails to make friends or find any happiness or inner peace. When he is eventually selected to work as a cryptographer for the state, he must leave behind everything he has ever known to participate at a remote and secret location on a project which will eventually consume him – the deciphering of PURPLE, the most difficult cipher ever created.  Once Rong Jinzhen (often called Zhendi by those who remember him) disappears into Unit 701, he is essentially lost to everyone else who has known him as he works to break this code for his country...The remainder of the novel appears in the form of interviews with two people, Master Rong, a female member of his family whom he saved during the Cultural Revolution, and Director Zheng, the man who persuaded him to join the cryptography unit.  These interviews convey Jinzhen’s history and his story, but they feature much “telling about” the action, instead of creating lively stories told from “inside the moment.” The author’s use of dreams, often disorderly, reveal Jinzhen’s state of mind, and a shift in style from narrative to Jinzhen’s internal reveries to convey his inner turmoil in the middle section of the novel show his alarming changes. A literary novel, unique in its focus, setting, and subject matter, Decoded lives up to its title, providing exciting new insights into many aspects of life in the People’s Republic of China - and if a reader also happens to be a mathematician or serious games player¬, this novel will be utterly irresistible.",¬

It deals with animal rights, veterinary dilemmas, and the pain of losing someone you love.Helena, a veterinarian, has died, but is able to see the life of her husband David, a lawyer.  She has left him with her beloved animals:dogs, horses and a pig.  He is so torn by grief he can barely manage.

They take me back to a time where everyone knew everyone in your neighborhood, kids could play outside and not be hurt, and the little shopping area in your town...""Twenty Wishes"" is the 4th installment of the series and she is doing great keeping up with all the characters.  Usually in series books they don't keep up with other characters when they try to concentrate on one...The list idea reminds me of ""The Bucket List""-and it has inspired me to create my own...I highly recommend this book-especially if you want to find out what is going on in Lillie and Barbie's lives at the moment.  A good and quick read.",
"fast-moving plot, more thriller than cozy","A mystery in which the sleuth is a professional geologist--and a woman at that--is certainly unusual.  Lee Mims' first mystery features Cleo Cooper as a geologist who has lined up a lucrative drilling operation on a rural property owned by Gladys Walton.  Much of the story involves two of Gladys's conniving family members (her grown children) who attempt to take advantage of her good luck and Cleo's in having found granite on Gladys's property.  The story is mainly about Cleo and her quest to get through the legal and ethical obligations of drilling for granite.  For the reader, it offers an introduction to the danger and difficulties that such a project entails.  Ms. Mims writes well, and the plot moves along quickly.  The opening episode with the rattlesnake (also depicted on the cover of the book) is gripping, and it offers a hint that there will very likely be more elements of a thriller to come...Despite the positive features mentioned above, I had a rather middling response to this book.  For me, it lies somewhere between a cozy and a thriller, but from the synopsis on the back cover, I had expected a cozy.  There are no endorsements from other authors on the cover, which can offer a hint about the genre, and it took me a while to confirm that this is not a cozy.  There is excessive gore, crude language, and sex throughout, none of which in my opinion adds much at all to the story or characterization.  For readers who may be deciding whether to give this new author a try, I would say that if you like the mysteries of J. A. Jance (and I do like them myself), there's a good chance that you will like this one too. Jance's characters have more depth though; Mims doesn't give us any insight into the psychological side of Cleo Cooper's motivation.",
Great author,This book series is absolutely wonderful for children to read it keeps them interested in reading and they love them,

Excellent to keep the kids busy.,"""Santa's Sleigh Is Full"" by William Boniface. Price Stern Sloan, New York, 2002...It was brought to my attention that I had written a review for each book on my Listmania! List except this one...So!..We purchased this book some three Christmases ago (2003) and used it to keep the grand children occupied as presents were wrapped and cookies frosted.  There are four little compartments with interesting cardboard cut-outs that fit just so in the story pages.  Each of my grand children used both fine motor skills and ""gross"" motor skills to place the cardboard toys in the correct location on the proper page. When we were done, we had truly loaded the toys one by one, as the author, William Boniface writes,..""The toys are loaded one by one..As the reindeer tug and pull...We know our job is finally done,..When Santa's sleigh is full!""..When Christmas was done, we packed away the 30 some pieces into the four different compartments. You can take the pieces for each page and put them in a separate compartment (everything in order) or you can  just put them away until the next joyous Christmas.",
excellent,For those of you familiar with the quilting arts television show and magazines; this book offers the same innovative techniques you are accustomed to.

After all, children like hospital patients are relatively helpless..Everyone can enjoy this book.  It can help anyone remember to suffer even the foolish graciously.",

Impossible to categorize --or to put down,"What makes you decide to read a book? It does not matter that the book was inspired by Louise Brooks but that could be intriguing enough for a start.  It is encouraging when someone like Borges- the fantasist - recommends it.  Comparisons to Philip K.Dick or Chesterton are handy, perhaps, as a hint. You may wonder how all of these very different references fit in this slim book.  But finally, when you do read it, all those references have to fall away (but perhaps not too far away) and the book must stand on its own.  Bioy Casares has created a surprising little marvel...Our hero is escaping the police for an unnamed capital crime, and finds himself on an island (a map is provided) decorated with three pristine buildings on the hill, but otherwise a barely hospitable place of vicious high tides, mosquitoes, swamps, reeds and misery.  As you work through this environment, Borges does come to mind, as it seems fantastic, with the imagery that seems a signature of South America genius.  You'll find yourself trying to determine whether what he describes is real or his own imaginings. After exploring every cranny of the buildings --and the descriptions remind me of art deco drawings, clean, clear, balanced but at the same time ornate-- he finds one day that the island is suddenly inhabited.  Not wanting to be discovered, he skulks around the visitors, drawn especially to the pensive and lovely Faustine and the book slips from Borges to a period mystery, a la Chesterton.  His understanding of the situation increases and it becomes more like a science fiction invention (the reference to Philip K Dick)... but still there is more, and when you realize there IS more, it becomes Casares' own novel, and stands on its own...It becomes a meditation on the nature of reality and our inability to separate the appearance from the nature of what is observed, the thin border between our own projections and fact, and even our willingness to consciously live in delusion. Does our hero become insane or is the answer to the mystery the whole answer, and his solution rational?..This is a very short book, with twice the atmosphere.  It is intriguing even while it feels like it is of its own time (1925 or so). When you finish it (in a day perhaps) you may want to read it again to take the time to notice how Casares has molded so many elements into a coherent story, building dread, curiosity and solutions incredibly cleverly. This is definitely worth your time if you like a book that is bigger than itself.",
Great Book!,I love this book it goes great with the rest of the series. Great writer too. A must have. Great.,
A MUST buy,Robert Beatty did it again!!! Loved this book! From the first chapter you are hooked! Go and buy this book!,
This was an incredible read,As I became immersed in this novel it became real to me and zip all.most believed it was a biography of Hemingway's wives,
Not wild about ending.,Same problem as most books of this type.  The ending was contrived. I imagine the author thought he was clever.  I do not agree.  Endings should tie everything together and if they don't it makes your judgment of the book less positive.,

Four Stars,my granddaughter who is 7 loved it,
What a WONDERFUL book!,"This is what you need. This book, a personal book, filled with simple truths tested since time immemorial. It's not a book with heavy handed ideology, or a book that seeks to attack. It is a book about Governor Noem's life where American values are adhered to and defended, clearly and decisively. We all, in these times think, can we just get an honest, forthright leader. Can we please. Governor Noem is that kind of person. And it's intensely refreshing. The book made me happy and its helps in these times of turmoil to reset, smile, and be hopeful.",

McMurtry is still an phenomenal writer but the book did not move me as much as some of his other books. This was required for an english class and I really had to work to read it and relate to it.

A good book for every day life,[[VIDEOID:mo2VOREGW0LRZD6]]Review of Soul Tattoo and who it is for,
Very good crime story author.,"Excellent story-line.  I thoroughly enjoy reading Karin Slaughter's books.

Not the best Grisham,"John Grisham has written a number of very good legal thrillers. The Appeal is not one of them. I have three reasons for my low rating..1. It is too black and white. All the bad guys are uniformly bad and the good guys uniformly good. The main plot involves a chemical company dumping toxic wastes that contaminate the water supply of a small Mississippi town resulting in numerous deaths from cancer. Finally, after her husband and son die from cancer a woman sues the company. A husband and wife team prosecute the case and the jury awards the woman $41 million. Of course the company appeals and a group of sleazy political operatives arrange for a young lawyer to run for the Mississippi Supreme Court with the intention of overturning the verdict...2. It Is hard to tell fact from fiction. In the Author's Note Grisham admits that much of the novel is made up. At the same time some of it is factual. It is hard to tell the difference. For example Grisham cites statistics the show Mississippians to be gun-loving, religiously conservative bigots and the appellate justice system to be corruptible...3. The ending is unsatisfying and incomplete. The reader is left with a feeling of injustice being done. For fans of Grisham there are many of his other novels that are worth reading,",$
Complex looking ingredients,Just got the book yesterday so i haven't had a chance to look at it all that well.  Just thumbing through the recipes it looks like the standard cookbook with too many ingredients to make it practical for a budget & quick weeknight meal.  I love seafood and shellfish in particular.  I'm just not as comfortable cooking with seafood because it's much more delicate and easier to screw up.  I guess i was looking for a bunch of ways to cook shrimp on a weeknight and this is more of a fancy dinner party recipe book in my humble opinion.  I still plan on using this book just not as much as i had hoped.,
"A nice set, looks good as display","Have taken my time slowly reading through these, not in a hurry-the case holds all 3 books perfectly, looks nice on my bookcase and keeps pages from dust",
Good read,"Very well written with well developed characters. I haven't read any of the other stories referred to in Nameless' chronicles but will have to remedy that. I like having all the stories in one volume so I can go from one to the other. Laugh out loud funny in places. In my doctor's waiting room I burst out into giggles and had a bunch of people look at me rather strangely, but they weren't seeing in their minds eye two of the characters hiding in a pile of pig poo. I love having the book on my Kindle Fire because I can touch a word to get the meaning, very helpful with the British slang terms used. Recommend if you want to be entertained but know there is also a deeper story under the funny fluff. Ca Bookworm",

Not impressed with the characters,"I know that Ed Brubaker has a strong reputation in the comics community, but I can't say that I was impressed with this. Kill or be killed establishes itself as a more grounded take on the vigilante genre of comics, but over four issues, I'm not really looking forward to more...The story starts on our main character killing a bunch of gang members, and him flashing back to how he got to this point. Dylan is a professional student with a lot (and I mean a lot) of mental health problems. After attempting to take his own life, he sees a demon (or does he!?) who tells him that unless he takes a life of someone who deserves it every month, he'll die instead. The story then follows his first sloppy kills to when I suppose he eventually gets good...I suppose my basic problem with the series is that it both wants to act as political commentary while also being bleak for the sake of being bleak. Dylan is prone to making standard political commentary about police violence, the drug trade, and social problems, which is fine as far as it goes. But he also wants to disregard the law and kill people to make the world better, which goes against pretty much everything the first thing is trying to be. This type of having the cake and eating it too results in some of the worst Punisher stories, and it doesn't work any better here. The fact that all the main characters are basically screw-ups didn't endear me to them either...I will say the artwork is good, but I'm not planning on going any further with this series.",
Good Read,Really enjoyed this novel. I do love historical fiction. The story was well developed and kept me guessing as to what would happen. I liked that it was not so fast paced that I couldn't put it down. I could read some of it and then savor in my imagination what life in Scotland in 80 AD.,
Thirty years a slave is a book for everyone,Excellent book about the history of Elizabeth Keckley.  She seems to be the only person that stood by Mrs. Lincoln.,
better than a travel guide,"This was a nice book to read before I left for Sydney. Gave me a bit of a different perspective than a travel guide would, while still offering plenty to explore.",

The story is excellent at holding my attention and was over much too soon,"Story..The Awakening: Aegis of Merlin Series, Book 2 by James E. Wisher and narrated by Joe Hempel is the second in a trilogy of books. The story picks up at the end of the summer break as Conryu and Maria head to The North American Alliance’s Arcane Academy by a magically powered train. He is once again harried by the press and one reporter in particular. Conryu is a fish out of water at the academy. He does not want to be there any more than most of the student population that views him as an abomination wants him to be there. This could not be made more clear that his initial reception of being bombarded with tomatoes upon arrival by three upper-class wizards...The first book in the series was devoted to world building and giving broad strokes to a wide canvas to give the reader and listener a feel for what kind of scope there was to this magical world. This time out the author has pulled back to focus on the hero’s journey. We get to see the highs and low’s Conryu endures during his first semester at the Academy. He is ostracized, attacked, and even Maria has little time for him. What is the only male wizard to do?..Conryu strives to make the best of it while trying to slowly understand his magical abilities and learn to live in a world foreign to him. He slowly makes friends and joins a Wizards club. As the semester goes on life moves on for both Conryu and Maria. When she is No longer the center of Conryu’s universe leads it leads to Maria’s consternation...Attention Holding..The story is excellent at holding my attention and was over much too soon. There are bound to be some comparisons to Harry Potter due to the Magic Train and a Magic Academy. But that’s about where it will end. These books are for older audiences and Harry Potter never signed a contract with a Demon. The world is unique and thought-provoking and holds the listener's interest due to the great story and the great narration...Narration/Production Quality..The narration is by Joe Hempel. Mr. Hempel again provides an outstanding vocal performance in this second audiobook in this series. He delivers not only compelling narration but also provides a wide range of vocal character’s interpretations. Each character was recognizable with unique voices done in a natural manner. The production quality by Tantor was top of the line as always they never fail to produce a high-quality audio product. Tantor delivered a crystal clear product of the highest listening quality...Audiobook was provided for review by the narrator...Please find this complete review and many others at my review blog...[If this review helped, please press YES. Thanks!]",
Cute & Fun,"My 13 year old 8th grader is an avid reader. Here is her review:.--- ""Would you prefer to be: the life of the party, or a wallflower, or a party crasher? Would you like to see: all the different pets you'll ever have, or all the homes you'll ever live in, or all the homes you'll ever drive? Would you rather: jump in feet-first, do a cannonball, or do a flip? -- Answer these fun questions and many more in this awesome quiz book! It is full of fun ""Would You Rather?"" type questions to get you  thinking. It would be a fun book to do with friends to get to know them better! There is really cute art on every page, too. I really enjoyed the book, and had fun going through it. Personally, I usually prefer quizzes with results that tell you something about yourself from your answers, but this book is just all questions.  It might be really fun for an ice-breaker, or at a sleepover, or as writing-prompts for a journal!",
Interesting premise,"I am a big fan of the “V” series.  This is a well written story, but it just never quite sucked me into the plot.  In my opinion, it was good but lacked feeling real.",
Very Cute!,"I got this as a graduation present for my boyfriend (cliche, I know...) but it was very cute!  I had everyone in his family sign in the inside (year book style) and it proved to be a very sweet idea.  The book came quickly and in flawless condition!",

Friends to lovers story that has some heat to it.,"Gracie and Hudson basically grew up together as he is her brother's best friend.  Hudson has always friend-zoned Gracie and she finally has had enough.  She has just graduated college, obtained her first real paying job doing what she loves and decides to find a man for the next step in her journey.  Hudson is made aware of her plans to pursue an online dating site and has a proposition for Gracie.  If Gracie gives him 3 dates he promises to teach her what she needs to know.  Gracie accepts his proposition but has second thoughts when she can't keep her heart from becoming involved.  Hudson wars with himself over what the right thing to do is and when Gracie finally concedes that they have to end their game, Hudson has a decision to make.  It was a quick, easy read and I had no trouble following along with the other characters in the book.  The ending was nicely done.",
Travel size,This is listed as a coloring book not a travel size coloring book so disappointed...and some of the designs are not even what I'd call steampunk glad I didn't order the set and next time I will read reviews because that's the only place you could find a size listed,
Excellent book on Ike’s career.,Love The Walton’s and this book about the background of Ike was fabulous!!  I could not put it down!!  Read it in a couple of hours.  I highly recommend for any fans and others.,

Five Stars,great read,
"A book about the business of rock 'n roll, not the music","I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is well researched and extensively detailed. On the other, much of this information is hardly bias-free, being shared with the author by Klein's son, Jody, in the hope that Goodman's biography will change the public perception. (That perception, basically, was that Allen Klein was a talented businessman--as a manager of some of the most important musicians of the 1960s and 1970s--but one who bilked major music artists out of fortunes, while still increasing the percent of earnings the artists themselves were earning. Klein was a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a man--and his story is a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a biography.)..Klein is quite a character-- a Jewish boy who spent some of his childhood in an orphanage and much of the rest, passed around experiencing the &#34;school of hard knocks&#34;. He emerged a tough, shrewd guy who learned to be an accountant and wasn't afraid to give unwelcome financial news to clients--even when they were members of the Mafia.  This tough-talking street savvy guy seemed perfect as a business manager for musicians and it's mainly on his relationships as the manager for many legends that this book concentrates. Among them are Bobby Darin, Sam Cooke, The Who, Donovan, Dave Clark, and - of course- per the title, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles (the latter, only after they had stopped performing as a group)...If the rock and roll business and its history interests you, you may enjoy Klein's story. For me, there just wasn't enough about the musicians or the music (other than confirming my feeling that I'd like Paul McCartney in person. The other Beatles, urged on by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were on board for Klein as their manager. But McCartney didn't like or trust him--as it turned out, with good reason--and this division was part of what precipitated their breakup, per Goodman)...My review is mixed just as my feelings about Klein are mixed. Again, the good thing is that Klein found so many artists who were in terrible financial contracts and extricated them then made their music more profitable for them than before. On the other hand, he took a lot of these new-found profits for himself and, much worse imo, he took the rights to their songs for himself and in most cases they were unable to get them back. In 1970, the Stones fired him, only to discover that he owned many of their songs and records. He did the same to the Beatles and they learned the same thing. He went to prison in 1979 for tax evasion but only served two months...Writing-wise, this is very detailed--sometimes too much so in describing people Klein interacted with--but he never really &#34;came alive&#34; to me in the telling. Perhaps it was because the author--so close to the son--is guarded in how negative to make Klein appear but as a result, it seems kind of flat and doesn't really &#34;ring true&#34;. I didn't see any interviews with McCartney (who didn't trust him--and was right) or Jagger (who hated Klein's guts for ripping them off) and their versions of events might have given this book the passion and emotion it otherwise lacked by, in my opinion, trying to gloss over a bit of what Klein really was and what he did.",
Brutally Honest In All The Right Ways,"This book was phenomenal. A potent dose of reality that will likely offend some for its brutal honesty. But that's what a good book does right? It gets you to think and probably sheds some light, providing a perspective you might not have otherwise had. No diplomatic​ niceties, no colorblindness but real talk. Mr. Coates is a National Book Award Winner for good reason. Seamless writing about the absoluteness of being black in America. A job well done.",
Kids love them,High interest for reluctant readers,
"I would recommend this book, but I would urge readers to keep an open mind and go into like I did- with very low expectations.","Three and a half stars...I preordered this book long before it came out. When there were issues with shipping from Amazon, I began hearing all of the backlash so I cancelled my order and requested it from the library instead. Because I had time to hear so much backlash and such, my expectations going into this were extremely low. Still, before I started reading, I made sure to get in the right mindset- totally open mind, not expecting much, etc...Obviously, there were some issues...It most definitely felt like a fan fiction more than a piece of work from J.K. Rowling. From time to time, I also felt that there were just so many things that were overlooked that this seemed almost like a rough draft, like it was very rushed. So I had issues with flow and the things just didn’t line up with the original series... They were all things that Rowling should have caught and fixed...Examples:..Using magic on Platform 9 3/4 in his third year- did they lower the age of magic outside of school grounds? Or does the platform count as school grounds?..Suddenly having Polyjuice potion available rather than taking the month to brew- Was that a mistake? Did potions improve so it was available faster? Why wasn’t that explained if so?..How they were in the library and then seemed to go straight to the girls bathroom, but suddenly Albus has Gillyweed…they must have made an off-stage stop. And Albus didn’t tell Scorpius what he was getting..?..Also, some of the dialogue wording seemed a little off, like there were words missing in some sentences...There were also a handful of weird things that didn't line up with the characters. Like how simply Hermione hid an item that she knew was very dangerous in the wrong hands (she's brilliant, shouldn't she have hidden it better?!) I also really didn't like how Ron was portrayed the majority of the time... Sometimes he was good old goofy Ron, but others he seemed like too much of a doofus...I also don’t understand the Part 1 and Part 2…was this play seen on two different days? The break between Part 1 and Part 2 doesn’t make sense…unless that marked the intermission of the play? But why title the book that way as well?..I straight up HATE that it is being called “Harry Potter Eight” “The Eighth Story”. Why couldn’t it just be a one off? Why did it have to be merged with the series? It’s not the same. If this was an actual novel that was fully written, I could see it being called book eight…but no. It’s a play and it was written by different people. It really seemed like Rowling only provided a weak outline...All that said….I tried to take this as it was and not think to much about it. So overall, I actually really enjoyed this play! I believe that if I had read this when it first came out, my thoughts would have been a bit different. But I thought it was exciting, I enjoyed the characters (LOVED SCORPIUS!) , and I could really see the play coming to life. I wish I could have seen this preformed in London!",
Five Stars,Good cookbook.,
Félix Vallotton,Ordered this for my son.  He loves this art form.  Recommended.,
Good Mystery,"Not quite a story that you can't put down, but one that contains intrigue and a developed plot that made me like to pick it up every day to read until the end.  It's a true mystery in determining who the culprit(s) are and why the murder occurred.  Although I clicked on one-dimensional for the characters, they're a good deal more than that, so other reviewers might easily click on developed and I wouldn't argue.  I live in the area where the author's career in television developed, and am familiar with that, so it was fun to read about places with which I'm familiar.",
Graveyard of Memories,"The book is a wonderful travel guide for anyone planning a trip to Tokyo. Very descriptive. I couldn't put the book down waiting for the next move. I liked the ""hero"" he was authentic.",
Great family game!,"This is just a fun, clean game for anyone who knows LDS missionaries and the subculture that goes along with it. Very easy to pick up, but includes enough strategy for experienced players to appreciate.",
Amazing book,Purchased as a gift for my uncle who has always loved astronomy. I was reluctant because I didnt want to get him a 'kids' book. I jumped for it and so happy. It is so much thicker than I thought it would be. And like others say the layout and illustration is beautiful. A great book to refer to. Can't wait for him to open it! Took the cover photo in the sun to see the awesome effect on the hard cover..UPDATE: gift was received very well. Very pleased !,
Scariest thing I've ever read.,"Terrifying book from cover to cover! Very interesting read, keeping me on edge the entire time. I could only read this during the daylight. It's written very well and is very detailed.  It also includes a few pictures of the family and house which is pretty neat.",
Five Stars,Excellent book to learn C#,
"Not the usual Cross story, very hurried.","Compared with other Cross books, this one was subpar. The story tended to jump forward a lot. It seemed the writer was in a hurry to get to the ending. Not his best by far!",
Nice little book for Bob Ross fans!,"Purchased multiple copies as a gag gift for my sons and nephews who love watching Bob on Netflix and repeating everything he says.  They love it! It has all his famous quotes which is perfect, along with many of his paintings.  Must have for any Bob Ross fan.",
Great Read,I purchased this book for my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The detail and the suspense makes it a very informative and exciting book to read.  I could not put it down. If you love history this is a great history lesson for any patriot out there. I think potential purchasers that read negative reviews of this book should first take note whether those readers are verified purchasers from Amazon. My opinion is if a reader is giving a review of a book on Amazon and the purchase of that book cannot be confirmed then the review should be taken with a great deal of skepticism.,
Not impressed,"This book was a let down. Arrived in great condition and in good time, but I found this novel just to be a re-hash of 'Bastard Out of Carolina'... Not worth it, skip this one.",
Small Book Little Information,Was disappointed in this book. It is small so does not have much information. Better books are out there on this same subject. Save your money and purchase one of those.,
Buy this! Keepsake!,I love this book for an end of the year keep sake. I had all the teachers at my daughter's preschool sign and write a special not for my prek graduate.,
Like Seeing an Old Friend Again After a Long Separation,"I have really enjoyed this series - now up to number 12 I think with this installment. It is unique in many ways and teaches many lessons about life...When I first heard about the series, it was on book 6. It worked out well, because I had so many books to read without having to wait. Now, I am all caught up, so the year between books seems like a very long time. It is like having to wait before getting to see an old friend again - well, the old friend in this case has come back for a visit!..Besides the more obvious things like the great characters in the series - after a while they seem like you actually know them as you would real people - what I really liked about the series is the detail about Botswana and life there. And so much of it is positive, unlike so much of what you hear about Africa these days. The books also teach many lessons useful to people everywhere, but from a Botswana/African perspective that can really shine a light where it needs to shine sometimes...The first book was especially good in portraying the Botswana background and viewpoint - I assume accuracy here as the author lived there a long time. The author seemed to move away from this as the series progressed; a disappointment for me, even though the books were still interesting. The good news is that I think the author is headed back in the right direction here with the last few books...As an aside, the TV series is great too; last time I looked into the matter, it does not look like the series with continue into a second season, but there is talk of a movie which is better than nothing. Most of the characters in the TV series were about as I had pictured them from the book - the main exception being Mma Makutsi. The actress that played her did a great job though; she just looked a little different from how I had pictured her from the book...Now on to the new book itself. I am happy to see that this new book stays closer to the series roots in many respects showing us some more about the real Botswana. The overall plot seems very vigorous too. I won't go into that too much as readers usually like a surprise, but here's a look at main story lines in the new book without giving things away...Remember the tiny white van that Mma Precious Ramotswe has been so attached to in the series? It is gone, but she is seeing visions of it. Hmm, that sounds like an interesting phenomenon. Where will this go? You'll have to read the book to find out...At a cattle post, two cows have been killed, and Mma Ramotswe is asked to investigate. Lots of suspects as it turns out, making it a challenge for our favorite Botswanan lady detective. Does she solve the mystery? No spoilers here, you'll have to read the book to find out...One of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's apprentices may have gotten a girl pregnant; he runs away when pressure builds to marry her. Will those young men ever finish their apprenticeships and stay out of trouble?..The ""villianess"", Violet Sephotho, is back. Remember her? She did horribly at the secretarial college when Mma Makutsi was there and shows up now and then to make poor Grace miserable. Anyway, Violet is running for the Botswana Parliament. They'd have to be desperate to elect her. What is up with this? Well, you'll have to open up the book to find out...And a perfect pair of wedding shoes - series fans will be pretty sure that the ""shoephile"" Mma Makutsi must be involved with those. Will Phuti Radiphuti finally marry Grace? The title of the book seems to refer to a wedding happening, but will it be Grace's or for the run away apprentice? Again, I won't tell here - you'll have to read the book...Lots of interesting things are in store for readers here. I hope that series fans will come back and read this latest book, meet favorite characters again, be entertained, and learn something about Botswana and life in general as well.",

A booklover's dream,"Any booklover should fall in love with this story, and read it to every child they know.",
"Outstanding book, even if you saw the miniseries, read this book","This book really takes you there, in a personal way. Yet, unlike so many of the ""first person interview"" type books that became popular after this was published, you don't lose out on the big picture. The strategy isn't lost even though we're seeing it from the squad and soldier level of the war. Ambrose deserves great credit for taking such a mountain of research and distilling it down to a very readable form. The book is as good a page-turner as any fictional novel, even though these are real people's lives. I saw the miniseries years ago, and was reluctant to buy the book thinking it wouldn't be worth it. But the book has so much more detail, and is far more personal. My father served in combat in WW2, and I have read hundreds of books about the war over the past 40 years. Band of Brothers rates among the best, and I strongly recommend reading this book.",

Interesting,"To be frank, this book was an impulsive purchase. I saw it at the bookstore some years ago, and bought it after scanning briefly through it. Of course, like most impulsive book purchases, it wound up sitting on my shelf until last week. Buckley makes a strong showing in this book as a political satirist, however his ability to craft a story has something to be desired. He was able to capture my attention for hours at a time with this book, but the I found myself dragging my feet through the last fifty pages or so: I kept asking myself if something was going to happen of any particular significance. While Buckely himself is a mediocre writer, his jokes and usage of intertextuality makes him interesting to read..The premise of this book is interesting enough, and gives Buckley an excellent jumping-off point to plunge the reader into a hilarious rendition of Alien abductees who finally have their day in the sun. The national issue of UFOs and alien contact is brought to the forefront of US media after a prominant televisoin host, Jack Banion, is abducted twice by a top-secret US Government collective, Majestic 12. It is clear that Buckley did his research; he intertwines this story with many references to various conspiracy theories..Banion, the protagonist, finds himself falling from grace - he is no longer on Washington DC's A-list. Rather, he becomes the champion of UFO wackos, people who come in throngs claiming to have been abducted. While the story line continues upon a predicatble path, the ending had something to be desired. Additionally, for such an excellent premise, Buckley really fails to do anything phenomenal with it..That being said, ""Little Green Men"" is not without its merits. While it was initially difficult to get into, after the first two-dozen pages I found myself smirking and, yes, even laughing aloud to what was said by Buckley. His political commentary falls middle-of-the-road, and while he does dish out a few low-brown sex jokes (probably pandering to the ""People"" magazine crowd), his humor does have some fine points. His continual parodies of government officials as bumbling fools become tiresome (if not already cliche before opening the book itself), but overall a worthy effort.",
Best series.,We have enjoyed all the Joe Picket character books by..Great stories intertwine and continue beautifully.  Start with number 1 and enjoy,

Good read,"This is book two from this author. I read the first book and ordered this from Amazon as well. It is a good read. Normally I do not read the same author two or three books in a row. For this one I read others while waiting for my order but I found that this would be a book best read right after reading her first novel. Otherwise it can be a bit confusing with the characters and events and may not excite the reader as much. Unfortunately, my buzz ran out because I had to try and remember things from her first novel.",
boring,not what I thought.,
A very solid and well crafted read!,It was a bit of a slow start for me but I'm so glad I hung in! This is a well researched historical fiction which I very much appreciate and enjoy. Robert Masello does a lovely job intertwining the factual with the fiction in a near seamless way. Which is quite a challenge if your readers are lovers of history but he does it very well! I look forward to reading more of his work!,
Five Stars,"Great story, beautifully illustrated by Deborah Hocking.",
Helpful book to study to Ace your upcoming test,Aced my government test thanks to the help of this book! Very pleased with what topics it covered and appreciated guideline to follow each day. Very pleased with purchase!,
Lab and Diagnostic tests,I found this book helpful and so did my classmates.  A couple of them bought this book also.  It gives very detailed instructions on how to collect a specimen and how to prepare the patient about a diagnostic test...It also give extensive result values along with what disease processes might be altering the values.  We also liked that it was easy to read and understand.,

Today Hope is Front and Center!,"Absolutely loved this book, but have to admit I love Laurell Hamilton.  Blurb stated that it was compiled to give hope, and it does deliver.  I really like anthologies for 2 reasons, new authors and short stories.  Since I've always had a terrible time putting down a book, anthologies give me a chance to finish a story in a small fraction of time..Love that these are new stories, and especially liked Twilight Falls by Jonathan Maberry (made me think of today's COVID-19 pandemic), Reprise by John G. Hartness, and Asil and the Not-Date by Patricia Briggs, one of my very favorite authors.  Had no idea that Asil had been the recipient of more than one date, I'd read of another of his date nights in an earlier anthology.  Now I have to see if I missed the other 3 since I really like that old wolf!.Working Conditions by Patrick M. Tracy made me rethink an employee/employer relationship, and Ronin by William McCaskey, the co-editor, gave me a new appreciation of my old Teddy Bear.  Laurell reminded me how important follow-up is in her Zombie Dearest..All in all, this collection made me think, and really did offer hope in today's world.

"Excellent ""how-to"" introduction to digital scrapbooking","I've become increasingly drawn to digital scrapbooking. Traditional scrapbooking is cool, but I don't want to get heavily involved with all the supplies, needing to clear out a space and so on. So it's digital scrapbooking for me. I am an experienced user of Photoshop, Illustrator and other graphics editing and design software... So why do I find an introductory book like this so appealing? Because scrapbooking is an art form unlike what I've done in the past. I need to develop new ways of seeing and not be bound by the restrictions of the kind of stuff I've been doing... The authors provide that introduction based around Photoshop Elements (""PE""), a trial copy of which is on the included CD, but you'll want to download the current trial version from Adobe's site... They take you through all the main features of using PE, but everything is centered on digitally scrapbooking... The approach is very casual. Quick basic introductions first to camera vocabulary, cameras, scanners (and scanning ideas), printers (with an excellent short section on papers and specialty media)... Next is an introduction to ""Digital Layouts  101"", which is thorough, entertaining and educational. This is also a guide to your first steps in using Photoshop Elements... After that, the book flows well into sections on image editing, using text, backgrounds and accents (the latter both digital and analog) and using digital kits... The authors really do this well. The book is profusely illustrated with very striking and creative layouts that go beyond simply demonstrating the techniques described, but rather serve to illuminate and inspire. Unlike the work I've been doing, scrapbooking lets you throw traditional rules out the window and create to your heart's content... ""Scrapbooking Digitally"" would be an excellent intro just to Photoshop Elements. Coupled with its focus on digital scrapbooking, it is an excellent introduction to both subjects...Jerry",
Bane of the Spider Queen,"Originally published in 1990, R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy set in the Forgotten Realms shone like a beacon in the fantasy genre. It was, and still is, comparable to Tolkein's Lord of the Rings and Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman's Dragon Lance series and - like those - is still being sold in nearly every major bookstore today...Then, in 2005, Devil's Due Publishing (traditionally known for their G.I. Joe and Transformers comics) began releasing a comic adaptation of the story with a script by Andrew Dabb and wonderfully detailed pencils by Tim Seeley...Naturally the full plot of the novels can't be fit into three trade paperbacks, but all of the essentials are still there. We can see the development, decline and eventual resolution of the relationship between Drizzt Do'Urden and his father Zaknafein and, most importantly, the bond between Drizzt and the ever-faithful Guenhwyvar, his panther companion from the astral plane...Drizzt was born in the underdark beneath the ground in the drow city of Menzoberranzan, a city run by the female priests of the dark spider goddess Lolth who relishes only evil and treachery. Brought up in a society so far detached from our own we would die within a day even if not for our pale skin, Drizzt is raised to be a ruthless and cunning killer...But Drizzt is born different from his kin and kind. He possesses an unimpeachable sense of honor despised by the spider queen who seeks only his death to ""appease"" for the good he has done, such as saving the life of a surface dweller in a drow raid aboveground...Rather than face certain death at the hands of his own family in order to restore their honor, Drizzt ventures out into the underdark with only Guenhwyvar at his side. But for the most reviled of the intelligent races in the realms it will be difficult to survive in the most dangerous corridors of the underdark. Thus must Drizzt journey to the surface to face a world unknown to any drow before him...The artwork in these comics is just astounding. Although much of the action takes place in the bleak environs of the underdark, the art remains colorful and vivid. Never have I wanted to visit a place so dangerous. The action is well wrought and never leaves you with a sense of confusion despite the numerous fights between Drizzt, who expertly wields two scimitars in battle, and the numerous horrors of the underdark and surface...Despite lacking the complexity and depth of the original novels, this is a series well worth adding to your collection.",
Read it. believe it.,"I purchased this kindle book as a sort of favor to a network member. I actually didn't eve pre-read the description!  That being said, I discovered an interesting read about a subject to which I am closely attached... That of communicating with those who have passed on.  When my dear husband/partner died in August of 2012, I had no idea he would visit...even though I had entertained hopes...and yet he did, visit, and does now still.  While to some this may seem &#34;hogwash&#34;, for me and readers of this book, it is far from that.  If you have experienced a loss of a loved one, I highly recommend this very easy read.",

"Clear, concise, easy to read description of the failure of science to explain the origin of life on Earth","Wells and Dembski are smart, clear, thinkers and their writing reflects their no nonsense style of providing the essential arguments that have been tried, and failed, by science to describe and replicate the emergence of life from non-life.  Describing how life came to exist on the planet in the first place is one of the key issues of our existence.  Did a couple of rocks bounce together during a volcanic eruption 4.9 billion years ago and create a complex cell complete with DNA and interacting molecules and a genetic code?  That is one tough problem to determine how that could have happened. No experiment, no hypothesis, no accident comes close to explaining how intelligent information was created in a self replicating cell in the first place.  Wells and Dembski give a quick, readable overview of all the failed hypothesis and then make a good case for intelligent design of life!  This is and interesting, quick, and comprehensions explanation of the status and problems of the science, and a defense of intelligent design that is accessable to the layman.",

Great buy!,Bought for my son. He loves it!,
A great first entry,"This review is based on an Advanced Reader's Edition provided as part of the Amazon Vine program...This is Cherie Priest's first foray into the world of Modern Dark Fantasy.  On the surface, it's pretty typical.  Female vampire protagonist.  Did I mention she's a thief/private investigator, and hot?  It has a few twists.  The first is that the client is a vampire, a blind vampire.  The other odd thing is that its written from the first person.  To be honest, I found this to be pretty refreshing.  You get to really experience the story from Raylene's point of view.  There are a couple of other real twists to the story, which I really didn't predict...I really enjoyed this book, and will be looking for future Raylene Pendle novels.",
Enjoying,Great series ! This one may be the best ?,
Gorgeous Cookbook!,I received this amazing cookbook as a gift. I have printed recipes all over my cookbook cabinet from The Stay at Home Chef before I found out she would have this cookbook. Now I get all my favorite recipes and so many more in one place with beautiful images and so many helpful instructions. Thank you Rachel and team for a job well done! I can’t wait to try some new recipes for Thanksgiving dinner next week!,
Good book! Namaste !,"I am just starting out with yoga to strengthen and tone my body. I hate working out!!! This book has helped me out a lot with starting off. This book was very informative and it had pictures of each poses.. Also, in the index, they had the poses separated for strength and tone, and for stretching..That was very helpful because I really do not have time to do all 37 poses..So it was broken down for what you are doing yoga for..With the pictures, it was also written how to get in the poses and hold it..The only thing I did not like about the book was that it did not tell me how to breath while doing the positions..Also, the photos could have been real people. The pictures were cartoons. But, that is why I have google..I have received this book for free. The above statement is solely my opinion and I was not persuaded in any way..I would definitely recommend this book to anyone starting out. Good book !",

Of Choices and Word Paintings,"L.M. Ross's The Moanin' After is a book about choices--choosing to live, choosing to die, and choosing to forgive.  In this, Ross's second novel, we follow his protagonist David on his harrowing journey through grief.  Ross beautifully shows us that grief is not a solitary process.  David touches lives in his quest to understand and accept the deaths of his friends Face Depina and, most importantly, Tyrone Hunter...And author Ross also makes choices.  Ross has grown as a writer since his first novel.  In it, Manhood The Longest Moan, Ross used his gloriously beautiful figures of speech to excess.  He created six or eight metaphors, similes, etc., and strung them together.  In The Moanin' After, Ross wisely chooses the two or three best of his creations to make his points.  And he makes them amazingly.  The reader can revel in his descriptions.  A poet at heart, Ross knows his subjects:  jazz, New York City, gay life, and what it means to be a Black man.  His word portraits rapturously evoke, sometimes bringing chills down the spine...If anyone deserves a deal with a major publisher, it is Ross.  An editor at Little Brown, Simon and Schuster, Clarion, or any of the other ""big"" publishers could work with Ross and turn him from a very good writer into a great one.  The man knows how to use words in a commanding and beautiful way.  He truly deserves better than his present editor and publisher...His current publisher apparently is dedicated to bringing African-American writers to the marketplace.  What a fine and noble goal!  But when every page has five to fifteen errors, how can this publisher be taken seriously?  The reader is forced to wade through sentences filled with repeated words and words left out.  Time and time again, verbs of two different tenses (think ""was""/ ""were"") are both given, as if the reader might want a choice in the sentence.  Or could it be the editor or proofreader couldn't make the choice him or herself?  And the commas!  My lord, my lord...they are just thrown in willy-nilly.  Someone needs to send this editor a grammar book--STAT!..L.M. Ross needs to be read, not decoded.  If there is a publishing god out there, please let Her send an angel to plop Ross's next manuscript on the desk of an editor familiar with the English language...Ross serves the gay community, the Black community, and the community at large with his humanity and his word paintings.  Read The Moanin' After--it has power and grace.  And after you read it, pass your copy on to your publisher friend...you know, the one who sits in an ivory tower office in Manhattan, waiting for the next great African-American author.",
Love it So Much I Bought Another,"I bought a second one for a Christmas gift. This cookbook is BEAUTIFULLY photographed, easy to follow, and heartwarming.  Five Stars from our family.",
Very Cute!,My friend who loves cats is going to absolutely love this for her Christmas present!  Can't wait to give it to her!,
Great stories,I really loved this book. Nice stories… great for young girls. Love the message it sends and enjoyed how well constructed book was. Would definitely purchase another volume.,
Love the crossover,I really enjoyed this book. I love all the characters and how well they merged. The storyline was fun and had some good twists and action scenes. I was disappointed in how abruptly the story ended. It would have benefited from a wrap up chapter to tie up the loose ends. It didn’t feel finished.,
Unexpected plot twists and turns,"This is a gripping mystery with some unexpected twists and turns to the plot that certainly kept my attention. However, I did think it was a bit unrealistic in that twice Troy Chance, the main character, ends up in the lake and manages to survive for an extended period of time even though the temperature of the water is only 60 degrees. Aside from this challenging and unrealistic situation, the story was interesting and engaging.",
Five Stars,Looks good,
positive teaching book,Behavior books are a great teaching tool for schools & at home.,
More fun than a barrel of monkeys!,"The story is terrific, and the writing is super! I write myself, and simply can't imagine trying to keep track of the plot with all the side quips and comments from Chet. The funny thing is that I had a dog who made very obvious non-verbal remarks like this all the time, but I don't think he was quite as smart as Chet. He'd never have found his way home across a desert like that...Chet really MAKES the story, that's for sure. Just wish Mr. Quinn would write more, faster!!",
Great!,Super cute and good message.  Good for toddlers and early elementary.,
Just as good as 2014,Paper quality is very similar if not the same as 2014 edition. The cover also tends to fold over like 2014 edition. New graphs/illustrations  and revisions are very good. Better then 2014 version. Do wish cover was sturdier.,
This book is not my friend!,"I cannot recall why this book was on my &#34;to read&#34; list. Had I read a review? Did a friend recommend it to me?.Even after finishing the book, I am really not sure if I liked it..There were things in Bev and Amy's relationship that I could relate to, but over all, not sure it was a good representation of the evolution of a friendship..I give this book 2.5 stars, but for this review I have decided to round down.",
Pizzolatto has captured the landscape of the south in interesting and strange short stories,Pizzolatto is a talented fiction writer. Galveston is a wonderful short novel and of course season one of True Detective was one of the best series every on television. I recommend this to anyone who likes literary fiction and enjoys the landscape of the south. He is a master with words. Hopefully season three of TD will be good.,
beginners level,too basic for me,
Teaches a lesson about paying attention and following instruccions,"My 6 year old got the whole series of  six books for christmas and loves it!  This one teaches the kids the important of listening and following directions. I like that each of the books in this series have a Pony Pointer Dictionary with a couple of the most horse vocabulary. A great idea, especially for city kids like mine.",
Four Stars,Subjects jump around a bit too much,
Laugh out Loud Funny,"Hiassen has FL nailed, and his use of language is great.  Bad Monkey is one funny character, and he is not really a lead, or at least you think he is not a lead character for some time, and then Hiassen does his thing.  A great read, perfect for a plane, lots of fun.",
She loved the logo,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend who is a total parrot head!  She loved the logo. If the material was a bit thicker, it would have been given five stars for the quality.",
Helpful,I got for the summer for my kid helped when she got back to school onf those small quiz,
Makes My Niece Happy,My 7yo niece loves this book.  Her mom texted me &#34;she hasn't gotten her face out of this book since it arrived&#34; which is all I need to hear.,
Slow moving but intriguing premise of disturbing psychological influence,"This book is suspenseful in a very slow way. I found the premise intriguing- participating in a psychological experiment of sorts that becomes a little twisted and reality is blurred from the manipulation. In actuality, I wouldn’t put much emphasis on the blurred reality part of the advertised summary- not really the plot. There’s times Jessica wonders if an everyday encounter is part of the experiment but it’s not really a ‘is she losing her mind’ kind of manipulation...Jessica enters a psychology study to earn more money for her family and the conductor of the study, Dr. Shields (no relation to me), takes a special interest in Jessica and asks more and more of her in future parts of the study. So there’s this mystery of why Dr Shields is doing this study, why such an interest in Jessica, what happened to Subject 5, and can Dr Shields’ spouse be trusted? To be honest, I was expecting darker answers to those questions than what turned out to be the case. I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I thought there would be a little more pulse-pounding action instead of neatly wrapping everything up with a bow...But I would still recommend this book. It was still engaging and as a psych minor, I enjoyed the psychology intertwined within, a lot of the referenced psych studies I remember from my classes. As long as you don’t go into it expecting a lot of intense action and suspense I think you’ll really like the story and seeing how things unfold. And it’s kinda a freaky scenario to think about. The implications of something like this happening, of a therapist having such personal information and manipulating clients and having the capability to affect and influence their life is definitely worth exploring in a psychological thriller like this...One writing style thing to mention: the chapters alternate POVs. It’s either told from Jessica’s point of view (3rd person) where we can hear her thoughts or from Dr. Shields’ (first person). But with Dr. Shields’ chapters it’s almost in letter or diary form directly addressing Jessica- which I didn’t really like. It definitely makes it more creepy I suppose, but some of the vocabulary or descriptions seemed unnatural for that type of writing... All in all- good book, will probably read others written by these authors.",
Five Stars,A quick and easy reference chart for the ways to ease pain.,
Huh...,"This the first book I read in the series and it will probably be my last, I made it about 45% through the book and realized this story just wasn't doing it for me. Sometimes it can be intriguing or even sexy to read about the taboo or forbidden this book (even though it's supposed to be about those things) seemed to lean more towards the main male character being creepy and the female naive and ignorant than sheltered and innocent. There also wasn't enough relationship build up between the creepy fake uncle that has random flashbacks of his niece in name only when she's young enough to be wearing pigtails and said fake niece. Needless to say, this one wasn't for me.",
Its a keeper!,"This book has the recipes I've been wanting. Using fresh ingredients in simple, easy to follow directions has so far worked out great. We're all trying to eat fresh and simple. This book is a great help with that. I'll be cooking these recipes often. Who knew Freddie was such a professionally trained chef? I didn't til I read his book.",
Enjoyable tale if you read it on its own terms,"Lyrically written, charming, and engaging, The Last Unicorn can be best appreciated if it is read on its own terms.  It is not a sweeping epic like any of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, nor a religious allegory like many of C.S. Lewis' works, nor a Disneyesque fairy tale with the perfunctory happy ending.  Anyone reading it and expecting some variant of these other works will be disappointed.  What The Last Unicorn does is take the traditional literary forms of the quest and the fairy tale, then stand them on their head in a very post-modern sort of way.  It does this to entice readers to ponder the philosophical questions that author Peter S. Beagle considers important...One certainly does not have to read The Last Unicorn in some deeply philosophical manner to enjoy it.  As a simple tale, it is entertaining enough, with wonderful prose, imagery, and characters that will stay with you for a long time.  There is the creaky witch, Mommy Fortuna, her Midnight Carnival, and the Harpy that will be her doom.  There is Schmendrick, the hapless magician, struggling to tap his inner wizard.  There is the genteel balladeer and highwayman, Captain Cully; his giant of a right-hand man, Jack Jingly; and his earthy charwoman, Molly Grue.  And, of course, there is the Unicorn herself, a majestic and magical creature, a primeval force of nature rooted in eternity itself...The tale itself begins with the Unicorn in her forest, discovering that she is apparently the very last Unicorn in the world. Although a solitary creature, this disturbs her greatly, so she begins a quest to find her people, leaving her beloved forest behind to travel a dangerous world.  Along the way, she meets new friends (Schmendrick, Molly Grue) who help her overcome the many ordeals and enemies that she encounters along the way.  Ultimately, the quests leads the Unicorn and her companions to the realm of King Haggard, the jaded and miserly ruler of a destitute kingdom by the sea, who may have had something to do with the disappearance of the Unicorns.  At this point, the tale makes some twists and turns, before reaching its final, bittersweet conclusion...Beneath the tale is a philosophical subtext that delights in exploring the answers to a variety of questions.  What is the nature of illusion?  Can we desire an illusion to be real so much that it does, in fact, become real - until its spell is broken?  What is the difference between time and eternity?  What would an eternal creature be like, and how would we react to it?  If an eternal creature could somehow be made to see things from a mortal's point of view, how would it react?  Beagle doesn't necessarily provide answers to all of these questions - at times, he just raises them for the reader to ponder...Unfortunately, Beagle can't resist dropping all-too-obvious hints that he is playing a friendly little game with his readers.  Anachronistic references to tacos and field recordings, a butterfly that spouts pop tunes from the 1930's, a talking skull that makes reference to ""character assassins"" - Beagle drops a number of not-so-subtle and unnecessary hints, calling the reader's attention to how he is violating the traditional norms of the literary form that he is using, and daring the reader to figure out why.  It's as if Beagle were sitting across the room from the reader, winking and smiling wryly...In the end, however, Beagle manages to pull off a difficult literary feat - creating a simple and enjoyable story that can be read at a deeper, more philosophical level.  The reader can approach it in either way and take something away from his work.  While it doesn't have quite the same emotional resonance for me as (say) any of Tolkien's works, the Last Unicorn deserves its status as a modern literary classic.",
A good book for kids,A good book to read and discuss with children about being respectful.,
Practical advice for real estate or other sales.,Good ideas in easy to understand format.  Sales are a tough market in this economy as we all know.  This book has some great ideas that combined with social network marketing make a difference.,
Fun and imaginative book with lots of twists,"Obert Skye (if that's his real name....) is indeed showing to the world what a talented author he is. He really hits home with the second installment of the Leven Thumps series. Poor Leven never seems to get much of a rest, this book is no exception it starts out fast and furious and keeps going all the way up to the cliff hanging end...The writing is clean ( parents should have no problems with their kids reading this book) the action is intense and non stop and the characters are fun and full of life. How could you not like a main character that is a tooth pick? This book is very imaginative and very cleaver. I wish it didn't end and I really wish I didn't have to wait another year or two for the next one.",
Five Stars,I have found many good lessons and ideas to use in my library.,
Wow!,Perfect gift for the MH lover you drool over!,
Five Stars,very helpful,
Exciting story with twists all around,"This is the best of the Bookshots stories I've read to date. The story is well-plotted, well-written, and well-edited. The characters are consistent with those in the longer Private books, so those I'd met before were instant old friends. The story involves the kidnapping of a Duke's daughter, and the action takes us around London in the chase to rescue her. There are new revelations and twists throughout, and I was rooting for them to rescue her before it was too late. Avery enjoyable story by a master writing team.",
Guilt a good book,I enjoyed it. I thought it had some great twists and turns. Nice combining of the two overlapping baby deaths. I recommend it!,
Admiral Corin Mendenhall,"He was one of our WWII heroes, and never was honored for his sacrifices.  The book is very well written telling us of submarine life few of us knew.  He'll be missed.",
One of the better Dr Ford stories,Wintering in Ft Myers brings me so close to the Dr Ford stories that I feel like I am a part of them. Shark River is one of the best as it gives great description of the local area as it was before so much development took place. This book has great in site into the rest of the series and really reveals the character of Dr Ford. A must read for Dr Ford fans.,
I was expecting an amazing love story,i felt that the story wasn't going anywhere.. I was expecting an amazing love story.. It was boring.,
This paper doll collection transcends into ART,"The distinctive style of the 50's defined glamour and the artist captures that glamour in every illustration.  The dresses are gorgeous and the detail shown make this book a keeper.  This is not your typical paper doll book, but really a lesson in real couture.  A must have for paper doll collectors, fashion historians and fans of beautiful costumes and clothing.",
Five Stars,This is a great book for any primary math teacher.  It is a great reference.,
History with the eye of the fiction author,"This is not a traditional history book and it seems that those who object seem to do so primarally on those grounds.  There is no question that this book does not read or even flow as a typical history which in my view is a tribute to the creative author and a a risk taking publisher both of whom deserve high praise...It is the reader rather than a historian who benefit from this treatment.  The myriad of detail adds color and depth to the men's characters in a way that no regular history book has ever done.  Yes the detail slows the narative and yes the author is all over the place, retrospection, current event, future writing all withing a page or two and yet somehow the whole thing holds together and the information is assimilated in a lasting and meaningful way...The reasonings are so logical and fresh given the years and speculation and outright lies that they shine from the page.  One example - why was Custer not scalped.  Reasons given over the years run from Indian admiration for his courage to contempt.  The author's take,  Custer's hair was cut short for the campain, he was also going bald.  In short his scalp was so unatractive as a trophy, that no one bothered...The author engages in speculation and unlike regular historians, he readily admits when he is doing so.  For example he openly shared his puzzlement as to why certain versions of Custer's death are rejected by one generation only to be viewed as the most credible by furture generations...All and all this is a wonderful read and anyone with an interest in this history would benefit even if some of the facts shared conflict with previous ideas...Custer remains an inegma but this book comes as close as we are ever likely to get to understanding him and the men who served with him.",
Wonderful book - the real romance of travel that is fast disapearing,"This is a wonderful book that reminds you of when travel was an adventure before globalization made it a packaged commodity. Anyone who loves the romance of travel and can get their hands on a copy should jump on it. The country and people are among the most interesting I have read about, the writer is a real person that takes you with him in a book that seems like what a friend would write back to you. This is a story that includes such things as writing to a Russian cartographer asking where on the map he thinks the true origin of one of the Asia's longest rivers is, meeting a forest ranger in a remote land who had always wanted to find it for himself and setting out through hundreds of miles untracked wilderness to get there. The Mongolian people are unique and you will find no references to a McDonald's. Their country is still theirs. This is a gem of a book.",
Really helps,Excellent product.veru helpful,
great book for my 4 year old,My son loves these sorts of books.  He had  lot of fun working on the book although it did require me to explain a few things to him he was able to most of it himself which made him and me happy!,

My Favorite Sweary Coloring Book To Date!,"[[VIDEOID:dc646dd551205b4ee04395ffa32ab969]] This is such a good Sweary Adult Coloring Book. I absolutely love the vulgar in this one LOL. This book is a little smaller than a normal sheet of paper but the designs in it are awesome if you like to swear. There is a lot of detail to color on each page so this book will definitely keep you busy for awhile. What a great way to de-stress after work or a long or rough day...The pages are all one sided which I prefer. If using markers or gel pens, I definitely recommend placing a few sheets of blank paper in between the pages so they don't mark through. The page thickness is that of a normal piece of computer paper roughly. The pages are not perforated so they will not tear out unless you just rip them out neatly if you wanted to remove any...Overall, this is my favorite Sweary Coloring Book I have to date. Some of the books claim to have a lot of vulgar in them but they don't. this has a lot of &quot;colorful words&quot; in it that are just awesome! In my video, I show all the pages that come in the book so you can see everything in it and decide if it's for you. I however would definitely recommend it!.I received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.",
Enjoyable detective story with some juicy courtroom scenes.,"Harry Bosch has lost his job as a homicide detective for the LAPD (again) and is at loose ends. At the same time Harry's half-brother, attorney Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer), is defending former gang member Da'Quan Foster, who's accused of raping and murdering assistant city manager Lexi Park...Mickey is convinced his client was set up and asks Harry to look into the case. Harry refuses because the idea of 'crossing' from catching criminals to helping them get off is abhorrent to him. Nevertheless, Harry takes a look at the LAPD's murder book and gets an inkling that Da'Quan might actually be innocent. The clue that intrigues Harry most is Lexi's expensive watch, which is missing...Meanwhile, two LAPD detectives have an inordinate interest in the Lexi Park case. They spy on Mickey and Harry, stop Mickey for a bogus DUI so they can search his car, and track the half-brothers with GPS devices. Then, when Harry starts to investigate the missing watch, more people are murdered. It's clear that something is rotten in the LAPD...The book moves along at a steady clip as Harry uncovers one clue after another, and builds to a satisfying climax. Full disclosure: I did get a tad impatient with a couple of sections about LAPD parking lots and gangs surveilling them, but this is a minor quibble...The secondary characters add interest to the book, including Harry's daughter Maddie - who's preparing for college, Harry's former partner Lucia - who secretly lends him a hand, and an Internal Affairs investigator that Harry has sparks with...The last part of the book has some juicy courtroom scenes (courtesy of Mickey Haller), which is icing on the cake of a good detective novel. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to mystery lovers - especially fans of Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller.",
My bible,"If you don't want to change - don't bother with this book. But, if you are a seeker, if you have the courage for your ""journey"" and want to connect more deeply to Life and those you care about, then this book is for you...I bought a case and gave them to every weary heart I loved, kept it by my nightstand (the true test of a good book), and feel it offers the insights of a bible. Every ounce of me recommends this book.",
"Great fun, easy cleanup, inspiring!","We get these from time to time with our little ones. We have currently a 1.5 year old and 6 year old. Both get some merritt out of these  books. The 1.5 year old just loves to make some shapes etc with finger paints as any little toddler does. She enjoys making the fish and other animals from the other books...My 6 year old enjoys doing them a bit more strategic, and improving on her drawing skills. She is able to complete the patterns based on just looking at the suggested layouts and ""steps"" to make the animals on the pages. She will do her own twists and use a fine point marker to finish them up with eyes, and scales etc...The paints are easy to wipe up with a simple wet wipe that you would use combined with a diaper change. It's been on clothes and tables with easy cleaning with a simple wash.",
Mrs Parsons is an excellent author and,"we can always use more literature of this nature , uplifting, encouraging . Mrs Parsons is an excellent author and teacher",
I don't get it...,"Gee, so much hype about this book, how could I not read it? But now that I'm finished, I can't undrstand the hype.....The story began well, with enough intrigue to make me wonder what the heck was wrong with this picture. And the language of the story (the writing itself) was very pleasing to follow.  But about half way through, after we discovered what was really happening with Amy, the plot became (in my opinion) implausible and a little silly.  The mystery started off seriously enough but then deviated into a soap opera tale of !megalomaniacal treachery! None of the potential plot lines from first part of the story were developed into anything diabolical ( e.g. the purchase of the gun, Nick's father's strange behavior at the housewarming, Amy's cryptic friendship with Noelle)--most of the mystery was dropped altogether--and then all of a sudden I was forced to accept an unbelievable (& I mean really not believable) turn of events unfitting of the characters thus far developed.  It was not like &#34;Wow! I didn't see THAT coming!!&#34; , it was more like &#34;No way! It wouldn't (or shouldn't) happen like that!!&#34;..Another issue for me, that I realized about 3/4 of the way through, was that the main characters, Nick and Amy, were falsely developed. The first part of the story portrayed them, in depth, to be certain personalities, but then those were discarded in exchange for the more wicked traits of the revealed characters. I understand that this was supposed to be the big twist, but the second-part Nick and Amy were never really fleshed out to make them believable.  I felt as if I never had a grasp on Nick's character at all--was he a handsome streetwise literary? A small-minded, small-town dullard? A scheming, twisted match for his sociopathic wife? How was Amy ever beautiful and gracious, if she was only ever calculative and malevolent? And at what point did they become poison for each other? I was never made to understand how their relationship became a &#34;sick, toxic M&ouml;bius strip&#34;:  that would suggest long-standing dysfunction, but that part of their story was not written here.  I felt that, in order to appreciate the grand turn-of-events, I had to blindly accept that Amy, and to an extent, Nick, were, and had always been, evil...I have many other small issues with the plot, and was perplexed by the resignation of the ending, but suffice it to say that a story with great potential for intrigue and complexity veered off to become a typical bland, superficial, best-seller-list mystery (in my opinion).",
"Interesting, but irritating","Migs Over North Vietnam provides a rare look at the philosophy, records, and environment of the North Vietnamese airforce.  I do not know of any other source for this type of information, and this makes this book worth reading.  The book makes several interesting claims.  For example, Vietnamese records show that many U.S. plane losses--which the U.S. attributed to SAM's--were actually downed by Mig-launched air-to-air missles.  This significantly lowers the fighter vs. fighter kill ratio claimed by American air forces. He clarifies the mythical Colonel Toon, and introduces us to the real heros of the North Vietnamese airforce.  However, Mr. Boniface goes on to claim that the North Vietnamese Airforce never truely lost control of their airspace and won a strategic victory in the air...Unfortunately, Mr. Boniface does not contest the attitude of the North Vietnamese that everything went according to their plan and that they won the air war.  However, using his own figures, one can calculate that 50% of all Vietnamese Mig pilots and 42% of all Vietnamese Migs were lost during the 9-year span covered by the book.  Furthermore, by his own admission, the North Vietnamese airforce was often unable to respond for several months at a time on several different occassions due to severe attrition of its personnel and resources.  I don't think that North Vietnam won the war on the ground or in the air.  I think that North Vietnam won the political and propoganda war.  Mr. Boniface's irritating rhetoric is helping to keep the latter victory alive.",
Five Stars,Thank you!!!,
A Great Read!,This book was one of the best haunted house/ghost story that I have read in a long time. This book captured my attention from the first page and just kept getting better and better. I thought the ending was pretty shocking. I thank Netgalley for the opportunity to read and review this book and I look forward to reading more books by this author.,
Spelling made easy,"I haven't checked this book out yet, I just know its going to be a good book for spelling. I hope that I will find the time to use it and enjoy it.",
A Pleasurable Romp for Those Familiar with Norse Mythos,"I am a Lokean devotee and a lover of all things readable, so I am always on the hunt for any new Loki-themed books I can get my hands on...I'm happy to say ""Father of Monsters"" did not disappoint! It's a fun, fast-paced adventure through the world of Norse mythology, with plenty of clever twists on the old stories. If you aren't familiar with most of the Norse pantheon, the characters and their motivations may be a little hard to grasp, as this story picks up around events that took place near the latter half of the myths' timeline. If you have a general idea of the gods' roles and history, though, it is plenty easy to grasp...The story is fast-paced and smooth, following Loki on his journeys between Asgard, the realm of the Aesir gods, and Jotunheim, the realm of the magically-gifted giants. The central conflict revolves around Loki's desire for godhood, which requires he serve Odin and the other Aesir (often against the Jotun, his own people), and his love for his family, particularly his Jotun wife Angrboda and their serpent son Jormungandr...The story incorporates several of the most popular myths, including Thor's Journey to Utgard, The Theft of Mjolnir, Thor's Fishing Trip, and references to many others such as Loki and the Master Builder and The Death of Baldr. Rather than being a simple retelling, though, these are woven together into a new narrative that feels very true to Loki's character and gives him and the other Aesir and Jotnar a much more three-dimensional, human character than many of the myth collections do...I highly recommend this book fans of Loki or Norse mythology in general. It's a refreshing take on the myths we're all familiar with, and a very pleasant way to pass a few hours.",
Provoking Thoughts,Nice deep saying that are a few sentences,
Great book,I enjoyed it and learned something new,
A great book!,My kids went nuts when this came! It's a very fun book!,
Outstanding! I can't speak highly enough of this book ...,Outstanding!  I can't speak highly enough of this book.  Walton helped me understand Genesis 1 in the context of the ancient Near East.  Changed my view of the subject of origins and purpose in Genesis.,

My comment is more of a standing ovation. 2016 ...,"My comment is more of a standing ovation. 2016, we have a woman running for president. We (women) have come a long way since the Suffragette movement began all over the world.  I saw the movie Iron Jawed Angels in 2004 and that movie alone inspired me to register to vote. I saw the movie Suffragette movie this year and its interesting how these women played a role in the lives we live today. I am so grateful, so honored and humbled that these women fought for what they felt was right. After reading this book, it opened my eyes to understand that 100 plus years ago, I was nothing more than property to a man. He was entitled to every possession I owned. I had no say to anything.... Anything!! How can you thank these women for what they did for us?  Vote!!!! Its 2016, you don't  have to vote for a woman candidate but vote for someone and let your voice be heard.  Vote!!!",
Five Stars,Love this book.,
Could not finish this nonsense,"I can't believe how awful this series has become.  When I started with the first book in this series, I was delighted with the setting, the characters and the plot.  This last book was so bad I couldn't finish it.  Fully the first 40% of the plot involves Bay and Landon arguing about nothing, very much like a pair of 5-year-olds..  Bay's family says she has become Whiny.  That is an understatement.  The characters of Bay and, to some extent, Landon have become inane and vapid.  Altogether a most disappointing read.",
Great series.. read it with your kids,This is one of those series I have loved reading with my kiddos.  They are well written and keep you entertained.  Great for an advanced 1st or second grader.,
An Old Standby,"For those drinks you hear about or you get at a bar, this book will have the direction to make it at home.",
A worthy read!,"The plot has been covered by others so I'll just head to my impressions. As a fan of McBride's previous work (musical and literary) I was glad to see he has delivered again. The writing is excellent, the characterization impressive and his ability to generate the milieu of late 60's New York amazing. A bit disjointed in places, it is still a worthy read and a great demonstration of imagination at work.",

A beautiful agricultural design!,"This is a very well written wonderful pattern for a church to add to whatever village, scene your making! Has all the layouts ou need to finish it - The detail is just as shown, the front steps of the church, the people, the trees………………………….lovely pattern.",
Finally - a baby book with bengali/english words!,"The pictures are nice, and baby seems to like looking at them (she's 8 months old). However the bengali names of animals and colors are written in the bengali script, which isn't great for my husband (who doesn't speak bengali) to be able to read the bengali version to our baby (or himself!)",
Five Stars,Love Nora Roberts books...great addition to my collection,
Not your typical Moore book,"After reading almost all of Christopher Moore's books, this one was a tough read at first.  It being a historical fiction book made it kind of slow at some points.  There are a lot of mundane parts that happen throughout the book since the book is about 19th century French painters.  The plot and story really pick up and start to make sense in the last 1/3 of the book...That being said, I'm a huge fan of his writing style, dark humor, and character development and had to go out and buy this book the day it was released.  I did read this a second and even third time, and loved it more each time.  The first time was very confusing and I was almost angry that he wrote such a poor novel.  The second and third time through (and probably 4th) I started to discover how wrong I was to even think that Moore could write a bad book, and that this one was genius (just like the rest of his library)...This shouldnt be your first book you read by Christopher Moore, because of how confusing it is at first.  Go for one of his other books first so you know what a fantastic, hilarious author he really is.  But this is a great book and look forward to more Moore!",
Held my attention,Interesting characters.  A few parts rather difficult to believe true but overall it worked.  A feel good ending. Nice descriptive language.,

Fun book,For my preschool class,
interesting,Interesting read but outdated. Don't understand why my biopsyc teacher wants us to read such an outdated book. Interesting cotect though.,
Nothing like 1984!,"I just finished the book. Throughout, I wrote out a few notes to keep track of questionable things. The main thing that bothers me (other than the wool and knitting theme??) is the fact that if the higher ups were so set in keeping their silos under their thumbs, then why, oh why wouldn't they install monitoring equipment everywhere? No cameras, no secret microphones, nothing to watch the lower down levels (or any other levels, for that matter). And where do they get their salt? Is there a salt mine alongside of the oil well? And how in the heck would people stay mostly sane without ever going outside, ever having the sun on their faces?..All that said though, I still liked reading this book and now I'm reading Shift, and hoping for some answers.",
I don't understand the critism,"I don't really understand the lengths I've seen people go to to discredit this book or the 12 steps in general. I am not a member of AA but I have a family member who was saved literally from the brink of death by NA. The changes in her and in her life have been nothing short of miraculous. If it was a 'cult' that brought about this change in her then I say Thank God for the 12-step cult, for it is truly a force of good.",
Beautiful,A gorgeous book with a message of hope in the depths of winter.,
A must read for a Cincinnati Reds fan (who also enjoys history),"This book is a great addition to any Reds' fan's collection! Its historical references to both the team and city are amazing, and you can picture the way it was in the early 20s. The references to the original team are fantastic (and even mentions the infamous Charlie Sweasy, whose error in extras cost the Red Stockings their undefeated status - although that wasn't mentioned in the book). I'm interested to read the others in the Mickey Rawlings series (based on other teams/ballparks) to see how they work for fans of other teams. And kudos to Troy Soos for combining his (and my) passions and doing his research!",
Great Comprehensive Book.,Great book with tons of info. Well written. Also great rare photos of Stevie Ray and his family! A definite. Must have! For any avid Fan!,

Do not buy this book - each page is blank,This book is a trick.  It is meant to be a joke but nothing in the write up says that.  Each page is blank stating that there are not any reasons why cats are better than dogs.  Do not buy this book.  Rip off.  Amazon should pull this.,
Amazing price,Came super fast and just what was needed.,
I love it.,Such a creative book.  I love it.,
Loved this book. Great characters and storyline.,I really like reading her books. Her characters are like friends by the time you finish and it leaves you wanting to hear more of their story.,
Fun read,"I liked it. A Galapagos cruise certainly sold this book for me. Yes there were some obvious plot ploys with the hot sister and the cringey boss but it didn’t stop my enjoyment of the book. I found this a better “beach read” than the book titled Beach Read which I also recently read. I would read more books by this author for fun, light and quick reads.",
My daughter loves these books,My daughter loves these books. Hard cover looks great too,
Great read,"A strikingly readable treatment of the history of the idea of Europe.  There are three essays by different authors, logically divided into the era prior to 1914, the period from 1914 to 1945, and the post-war era.  Each section is well written, readable, and contains fresh perspectives, at least to me. My  only disappointment was that the last essay covers only until the early to mid-1990's.  I'd love a chapter four to bring things up to date, as Europe continues to evolve.  Issues around immigration, for instance, are not treated, nor the various European military commitments like the Bosnian War.  On the other hand, the reader is left wanting more.",
Great reference!,This reminds me of Dr. Minke's work as well. Great reference to help releasing patterns!,
Five Stars,Really great,
Good book for 10 year old,10 year old granddaughter loved this story about the Vanderbeeker children,
Not as enjoyable as Henry V,"I read parts 1 and 2 of Henry VI to close out my New Year’s resolution. I didn’t like these two as much as Henry V. None of the characters are particularly likeable, and it’s mostly just a bunch of noblemen squabbling over succession.",
"Good Story, but....","A lot of the dialog was overlong and tedious, and made for pages of tiresome reading...It just didn't move as well as it should...Not as good as some of Ms Johansen's other books.",
Returned,This was not what I was looking for and it was sent back to seller.  I reordered another that I just love.  The Fix-It and Forget-It is a huge cookbook full of recipes that I will actually use.  I wanted lots of soups and stews for a crock pot.  I am very happy now.,
numerous characters a bit distracting but solid writing throughout,"I discovered Lois Menzel through an anthology and began to actively seek out her Regency romances. This is the 3rd of her books I've read and it was very enjoyable. I thought there was solid writing throughout. There were numerous themes and sub themes and at one point I found myself asking ""who again is Harriett?"" So many characters to follow. But overall a well written book with none of the meaningless repetitions you find in more current regency romances - what I call fillers. I can just imagine an editor saying this book is good but not long enough and some poor writer having to find words to fill up the number of required pages. Lois was a teacher as well as an accomplished writer and the kindle I just received should make reading her complete works much easier.",
A Realistic Look..,"First off, I want to say that I almost didn't read this. I believed this to be the first volume in the series, and I was immediately turned off by the artwork. Then, just to be fair, I gave the book a chance. I learned that this was the second volume and that I needed to find out what had happened before. Thankfully, Wikipedia exists, so I was quickly able to catch up. I have to say, this series is a realistic look at how society would most likely deal with superheroes. They would, of course, be viewed with some stigmatism by the non-powered members of society. This was pretty inventive, and made me think of Alan Moore's Watchmen. Having read many of the other books in the series now, this book really just brings the audience in slowly to get them used to what the heck is going on. I am glad I gave this one a chance.",
Roller coaster and it's the best ride!,"This book is so unique it's very hard to describe! There's always something going on and the brothers have been so hurt but seem to know that this girl is their one and only. She's tough and smart and her dark side is a compliment to theirs. This has everything, heartache, bitchy girls, hot guys, and the why choose is not just about sex its about her love and their love for her. This first book ends in a cliffhanger, no surprise, but I'm sure the next book will be as amazing as this one!  The writing is superb and the characters are not shallow but as I read deeper into the book I'm attached to each one. This is a blow your mind book! Enough light humor at the right moments are well written. There's some scenes that some may have difficulty with but I didn't. Dark reads have tough scenes and that's why their dark. I'm off to start the next book! Enjoy :!",
Much More than a Baseball Book,"Joseph Schuster's ""The Might-Have-Been"" is a terrific baseball book in the vein of ""The Natural"" or ""For Love of the Game"", but it's also a well-told 'Everyman' mid-life crisis novel on par with some of the best of the genre (for me, something like ""Straight Man"" or ""The Sportswriter"").  This novel wins on both levels and is easily one of my favorite reads of the past 12 months...""The Might-Have-Been"" is the story of Edward Everett Yates--brief MLB professional and a man who's essentially committed his life to the game he loves.  The novel spans 30 plus years as Schuster details Yates' brief time in the majors and more interestingly, Yates struggles to deal with his life as it is (and the human condition in general).  Yates is depicted as a slightly better than average minor leaguer who finally gets his shot in the show only to get injured in a rain-shortened (non-official) game in which he hits for the cycle.  An earlier substitution for Lou Brock and a base on balls in his only at bat is the only blip in the MLB record books for Yates.  And as with many athletes, Yates cannot let go of his dream.  Schuster puts it best himself when he writes (about Yates): ""He realized they had seen the open door to the world outside the locker room as an invitation and not banishment; baseball was just an interesting visa stamp in the passport of their lives, while he had gotten stuck at the border, unable to cross.""..Yates dabbles in the family business and has some success there, but baseball's grip is too strong.  Schuster moves the story on nicely as the somewhat sympathetic Yates makes one dubious decision after another (both in job choices and relationships) seemingly doomed to spend a life in the game that's dealt him so many cruel blows.  It's a well told story, and despite Yates' poor decision making (easy to judge from outside and behind), Schuster makes him a character I could cheer for.  This is a very entertaining novel--both for the baseball fan and for the fan of great fiction.  Schuster again (via Yates): ""Be grateful for the life you have rather than regret over the one you don't.""  This novel is a treasure and very highly recommended.",
AJAX,"'Ajax: The Definitive Guide' certainly is definitive.  With 950+ pages of content, this book doesn't know the word brevity.  Spanning 23 chapters and 4 appendixes, this book covers everything you would want to know about AJAX.  From its history to how it's grown to where things are today and in the future, this text is very complete.  If you are new to AJAX and want to learn how to use it in an extensive way, this is a great resource.  My only qualm with this book is that I feel it is just TOO big in size.  A 'Learning AJAX' book at around 200-300 pages would be a great companion book to have on the side, then switching over to this bible-size book would be a good transition.  Overall this is written well, laid out in detail, and typical O'Reilly quality...***** RECOMMENDED",+
Great story.,"Bohjalian is a wonderful author and the storyline was very interesting and a great read..His book the Sand Castle Girls was a great read and of the book he commented,  &#34;Single most important book I'll ever write.&#34;  A very meaningful and personal book for Bohjalian.  Will be reading many more of his books.",
A STELLAR historical crime novel!,"Smoke and Ashes truly deserves five stars..The first star is for the most important element: an interesting story and a well-done dramatic climax..The second star is for the setting, which vividly evokes India in 1921..The third star is for the history I learned along the way about the independence movement Mahatma Gandhi led during this period and for the way it was woven into the story so well and so believably.  I  especially appreciated the author’s note at the end to tell me what was real and what was fiction. Prince Edward really did visit India in 1921, for example, and Chitta Ranjan Das, his wife Basanti Das, and Subhash Bose, who play important roles in the book, were historical personages of great importance in Gandhi’s non-violent independence struggle..The fourth star is for the protagonist character, police captain Sam Wyndham. Sam is an excellent narrator for the book as he struggles with several important issues. His role as a police officer overseeing Indian society is not an easy one. Clearly he has adapted to the society and come to appreciate it in many ways, even going so far as to share rooms with his Indian partner Surendranath, known to the British as Surrender-not.  Even more difficult is Sam’s addiction to opium as a result of his experiences in WWI. I give Mukherjee high marks for his handling of this aspect of the character; too often protagonists in crime novels who have a serious dysfunction become cardboard sufferers, but Sam is a well-developed believable person..Finally, a fifth star for tying all these elements together with  some darned good writing, which made me often highlight passages such as this one: “Calcutta was as flawed and dysfunctional as I was: a city built in the middle of a fetid Bengal swamp, populated by misfits all struggling to survive against the odds.”.I have not read the first two books in this series, but after reading Smoke and Ashes I am not at all surprised that the first book,  A Rising Man, won the CWA Historical Dagger Award and was shortlisted for the Edgar for Best Novel. I can’t wait to read it.",
Wonderful way to introduce children to first ladies,Nice pictures for coloring and facts for each lady.  Perfect for a six year-old who loves coloring and learning about history.,
A must-have if you are visiting Maui,"Order this book so you have it at least a month before your trip. It includes tips on what to bring, what you should schedule in advance, and what can wait until you arrive. It has reviews of nearly all the activities of the island, including reviews of the companies, restaurants, etc. It is well-worth buying and will really make your trip smoother.",
Three Stars,"Good book, but hard to use if you don't know the words.",
"Relatable topics, inspiring ideas","This was a very enjoyable book! Not only was interesting, funny and well-written, but the topics are very relatable regardless of age or season of life. Everyone has stuff, but the stories behind the stuff are worth telling and that’s exactly what author Donna Cronk did. Her cleverly-woven tales let you get to know her and her family’s history. The method in which she approached her sorting and purging are admirable and creative. She offered solutions for disposing of unwanted property that I hadn’t thought of previously, including upcycling items for entertaining craft projects and other practical purposes. She also posed unique thoughts pertaining to uncluttering your digital storage areas, which hadn’t really crossed my mind until I read this book. This is a great read that will keep you entertained page after page and create inspiration tackle your own clutter!",
Great Story,This coming of age story is completely intriguing from the first page. It kept my interest to the point I hated to put it down until I was finished and then didn't want it to end. The story setting and characters are realistic and believable. An excellent book.,
Great gift,"While Christmas shopping, I was trying to find something for a relative of mine. Her interests include sharing quotes on facebook and art. I thought this book would be a great approach to a gift for her. She loves it. It was a perfect combination of art and quotes..I thumbed through it when it arrived. Inside there are beautiful, vibrant colors.",
I'm keeping this one.,"This book is complete, thorough, and a very good work book.  It doesn't take anything for granted, like many math books I've tried to use in the past have - like (and I've had math teachers tell me this), &#34;Well, this is just something you should know.&#34;..It offers (as stated on the book's back cover) all topics broken down into lessons, practice problems, step-by-step example problems and free online access to more practice problems...The history of numbers is told (it's an interesting section) in the clear, plain language that is used throughout the entire book.  It covers addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and continues on to more difficult mathematics.  The book explains why things are done, not just how.  I think it is very much worth the price and I'm keeping it in my library for a reference book.",
Pocahontas: Free and then Almost Aristocrat,"Got for my 10 yr old granddaughter. With a Cherokee Aunt, I grew up with great respect, love and compassion for our First Settlers. The Pocahontas story is what can and did happen when the West first met America, and it was not only a good thing. The only story of this courageous young (probably a late teen), Her true story is still epic; however, her end is sad but necessary for all to know.",
Helpful book for preschoolers and kindergarteners,"This book really is a helpful book.  I am a certified teacher and one of the biggest things I learned about early childhood education is that children need to build their background knowledge so that they can understand the world and understand what they read and learn about.  This book is a great way to help children understand what the world was like for Abraham, David, and Jesus.  The illustrations and language are very appropriate for early readers and preschoolers (ages 3-6).  I like the pictures a lot.  I bought this to accompany the Early Readers Bible for my daughters for homeschooling next year and I am excited to read them with them!",
Great illustrations,My daughter and I love flipping through the pages and laughing together.  Great illustrations allow you to make up the story as you go.,
Awesome Book,"Great book. Met him in San Diego in the 80`s cool dude. His short stories are great. He said it ""If I say a Water hole is in my book, it is there and the water is good to drink.""",`
Side story of Nexus series,"This story picks up the side story from where the Nexus, Abby, insists that the human halfbreeds with affinity to magic be brought into the fold, matched with mentors and taught how to access and use their magic.  This is also the story of Sophie and her mentor, a relative of Zander's named Raffin.  IMO, not really book 2.5 and can be read after Pixies in the Park...I would recommend that a person read this series in the following order regardless of how the order is stated in the descriptions:..Raven Dexter, Paranormal Midwife.Impractical Magus.Chubby Is The Night.Gnomes of Suburbia.Gargoyles in the Round.A Nexus Xmas.Pixies In The Park.Hotel Spectre.A Nexus Wedding",

I love Lina Kostenko and I’m happy to add this book to my collection!.Ukrainian language is beautiful. Ukrainian literature is beautiful..Slava Ukraini!",
Star Trek The Next Generation 50 years later,"A lot of science, engineering, relativity, cosmology, other scientific disciplines involved, altho not understanding all  the technical details does not prevent the understanding and appreciation of the novel.  It is intensely oriented to the humans on board -- their personalities, ahilities, relationships, adaptability, interests, etc.  You obtain a picture of the universe and its properties and a view of what types of problems and difficulties might be encountered by future space travelers..(I mentioned Star Trek The  Next Generation because there were many episodes which  relate so closely to this book; and Anderson came before Roddenberry.).Admittedly the book was a bit long and sometimes tedious in the middle but that was my reaction, not a defect in the book.  The death of the universe  and the rebirth was very interesting: is that what will happen? The only aspect of the book that was sort of unreal was the ending, sort of a fairy tale ending, but at least a hopeful ending with the promise of a future.",
OUTSTANDING!,All I can say is THANK YOU to Ray Stedman and those that have helped edit and put his teachings into book form. Ray Stedman was used mightily by the Lord in order to accurately teach the Word.,
