{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Mercenaries at Play", "text": "I went the distance and frankly wasn't much impressed. Overly long and populated with too many secondary characters, the tale features  Charlotte, whose cultured existence covers her secret life as fixer. For a fee, she provides information and identification for various and sundry mercenaries. Against her better judgment she  agrees to assist a hit man  who needs to break into a prison to complete a hit.<br /><br />Although the writing was crisp and the action scenes taut, the characters were stock and difficult to care about. Relative morality is a hard  sell and with murky motives and mutable loyalties, it is a challenge to remain engaged. Narrated by the major players, it has plenty of graphic violence. The plots were all somewhat familiar, i.e., breaking into prison, the brutal prison colony presented as a progressive program, the veneers of civility. I found the longing between Charlotte and the hit man unconvincing. It would have better had there been characters worthy of emotional investment. If you enjoy clever but familiar plot devices, strong action scenes and graphic violence you will probably enjoy this book.

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Melissa & Carrie's part was interesting", "text": "\"The Price\" is a romance novel with a mystery. The romance was pretty typical: worries that could easily be put to rest if they simply asked about them came between the \"perfectly matched\" pair, Toni and Abe. The main \"whodunit\" was never in question, but Toni did question some people about a possible accomplice. Though the unknown accomplice was not obvious, anyone who reads a lot of mystery novels should have no trouble spotting the accomplice. However, Toni and the police--though getting close--were stumped until said accomplice decided to kill Toni for being nosy instead of sensibly going into hiding in another state.<br /><br />Anyway. The Christian general fiction aspect of the novel was very good. Teenager Melissa had to deal with why God would allow her best friend--who loves God and wanted to be a missionary--to be shot by a school shooter and paralyzed by the bullet, yet Melissa and others weren't even hurt. Melissa's friend and an elderly lady living with Toni and Melissa gave good, godly answers to her questions.<br /><br />Melissa's turmoil, struggle, and way of reacting to the people around her was realistic, and her best friend also struggled realistically with forgiving (or not) the boy who shot her. The other characters were complex but their actions sometimes didn't seem realistic to me.<br /><br />There was no sex or bad language. This book was the second in the series, and it thoroughly discussed the case and \"whodunit\" of the first novel. However, the first novel hit about every pet peeve I have, so I'd recommend you just start with this book if it sounds interesting to you.", "images": [], "asin": "0805425667", "parent_asin": "0805425667", "user_id": "AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA", "timestamp": 1290442811000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 0, "rating": 2.0, "title": "weak worldbuilding and characters", "text": "Breathe, by Sarah Crossan, is an unremarkable new entry in the teen dystopia field. Its premise is relatively simple:  in the far future, the world's oxygen level has dropped so far that people are relegated to living in oxygenated \"pods,\" where \"Premiums\" get all the oxygen they want and the commoners have to get by with far less. One result of this disparity is that the average person has to carefully moderate their physical activity (there are \"speeding\" laws with regard to walking) while the Premiums can go for a nice little job with their person oxygen tanks. The company that controls the oxygenating process, Breathe, controls the pod. It will come as no surprise that they're just a little corrupt and power-hungry.<br /><br />We're introduced to this world via three teen point-of-views. Alina is a commoner who is also a member of the resistance, a group trying to take down Breathe as well as break the monopoly of the pod's on human existence, both by long-term re-oxygenation of the atmosphere and by short-term retraining of people to enable them to survive in the outside. She's embittered and wide awake to the realities of this world, though not utterly aware of how far the resistance will go. Quinn is the son of a higher-up Premium and is being groomed to take his own place among the elites. Bea is his commoner best friend. Both have so far blithely accepted all they've been taught of their society's workings, though that will soon change once their paths intersect with Alina's. As one might expect, the seemingly inevitable triangle forms:  Bea wants to be with Quinn while Quinn, oblivious to Bea's desire, wants to be with Alina. Alina, meanwhile, just wants to be with the Resistance.<br /><br />As is usual with books I don't much care for, this will be a relatively quick review, as I don't like to belabor a book's flaws or bash an author who has at least accomplished completing a novel, even if it wasn't a very good one. To begin with, Breathe's plot is not particularly compelling or surprising. The three characters are introduced one after the other and then quickly end up outside the pod together. In short order they are facing off with Breathe's soldiers and running into the Resistance, though there was never any real sense of danger or urgency with regard to what might happen to them. Worse, many of the violent encounters felt a bit cartoonish and barely sketched in.<br /><br />The Worldbuilding is also pretty sketchy. I had a problem with the general premise as it was presented, and while there were occasional flashes of sharp details, mostly in the early sections, overall the setting and society never came alive as real constructs. The same is true of the characters, who do change but in pretty much wholly predictable fashion. None of the side characters, save one (an old woman whose been outside for some time), feel fully fleshed out, playing more as types or plot necessities than real people (one might get my pick for worst naming of the year, a villain named \"Cain Knavery\"). The prose is mostly pedestrian throughout, rarely rising above merely functional and at times its simplistic, repetitive nature was distractingly noticeable.<br /><br />Breathe ends with some resolution but with a clear path forward. I, however, will not be picking up book two, as for me, Breathe failed across the board: character, story, setting, style.", "images": [], "asin": "0062118692", "parent_asin": "0062118692", "user_id": "AEJIPQY4UD6ZS2ATZPPUSQYEVSQA", "timestamp": 1357577674000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 0, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Thinks inside the box", "text": "It is possible to read too much into a picture book.  A funny statement since what were talking about is literature for people who haven't even seen a decade of time pass them by.  But historically picture books have been places where prejudices are both intentionally and unintentionally on display.  Yet for every \"[[ASIN:1849393893 Denver]]\" by David McKee (a picture book about the beauty of trickle down economics) you'll find fifty people reading WAY too much into something like \"[[ASIN:1558584412 Rainbow Fish]]\" (communist propaganda) or \"[[ASIN:1442433701 Click, Clack, Moo]]\" (inculcating kids into unionism).  The thing is, picture books are meant to teach and inform our children.  Yet along the way a parent or gatekeeper might be worried about the unintentional messages getting pushed along the way.  At the end of the day you have to weigh your reactions carefully.  You can't be pointing fingers left and right, claiming authorial intent where there is none.  Okay.  So round about now you're trying to figure out what the heck any of this has to do with \"The Day the Crayons Quit\" by Drew Daywalt.  I mean, talk about an innocuous title.  Why am I going on and on about unintentional messages in works of children's fiction in preface to talking about this book?  Well, here's the trouble.  I have a major problem with this story and it's entirely possible that it's just in my own head.  So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to lay out the facts as they stand and you can judge for yourself whether or not this book does indeed make a major you-can't-do-that-in-the-21st-century mistake, or if I'm simply suffering from a case of Reading Too Much Into It.  Either way, it sure makes this Daywalt/Jeffers collaboration into an interesting point of discussion.<br /><br />Duncan's your average kid.  Not the kind of person who's going to expect that when he reaches for his crayons at school he is, instead, going to find himself with a bundle of letters.  Each letter is from a different crayon voicing their complaints.  Says gray, \"I know that elephants are gray but that's a lot of space to color in all by myself.\"  Or pink saying, \"Could you please use me sometime to color the occasional pink dinosaur or monster or cowboy?\"  Red and blue need a rest, white feels empty, yellow and orange both claim the sun, and all black ever wanted in life was, for once, to color in a rainbow or a beach ball.  By the end of the letters Duncan wants to make the crayons happy.  And that's when he comes up with the perfect solution to everybody's woes.<br /><br />Now let's talk crayon history for a bit.  This is fun.  In 1962 the U.S. Civil Rights Movement was underway.  America was going through big changes.  Assumptions that had lain dormant for years were finally getting challenged and even crayons were getting a double glance.  You see 1962 was the year that Crayola decided to officially change the crayon known as \"flesh\" to \"peach\".  You see where I am going with this, I suspect.  While white children certainly would use the color as flesh, it wasn't exactly on the up and up to assume that white was the de facto skin color.  Fast forward to 2013 and the publication of \"The Day the Crayons Quit\".  Peach does indeed make an appearance in this book and in that section complains vociferously that its wrapper has been removed.  \"Now I'm NAKED and too embarrassed to leave the crayon box.  I don't even have any underwear!\"  That Daywalt is linking peach to flesh again is no crime.  Interestingly, on the previous page the pink crayon has been making a very different complaint about never being allowed to draw cowboys or dinos or monsters.  The monster that it HAS drawn is covering its private parts, obviously believing itself to be naked as well, as the dinosaur points and laughs.  So.  Pink and peach are clearly equated with flesh tones.<br /><br />Then what's the deal with brown?<br /><br />There is only one vaguely brownish crayon in this book and it is the much maligned beige.  The official brown does not make an appearance it would seem.  Beige's sadness is the fact that while \"Brown gets all the bears, ponies and puppies . . . the only things I get are turkey dinners (if I'm lucky) and wheat.\"<br /><br />Mmm  hmm.<br /><br />This is precisely where the difficulty comes into play.  How much am I reading into this through my own prejudices?  Let me give you a bit of comparison.  This year is also seeing the publication of \"[[ASIN:076365714X The Black Rabbit]]\" by Philippa Leathers.  In that particular book a little white rabbit keeps seeing a \"scary\" big black rabbit that he runs away from.  The black rabbit is, in fact, the little rabbit's own shadow and at the end he comes to love the big black rabbit after all.  A librarian recently commented to me that it would have been far preferable if the little rabbit had been brown or some other color.  Otherwise you have a book where a white character fears a big black one.  At first I was inclined to agree, but after thinking about it I wasn't so sure.  After all, the white rabbit's fears are entirely in its own head.  There's also the fact that the book, I believe, is originally Australian, so the author wasn't working with a lot of the codes and keys common in American culture.  I was even reminded of the huge brouhaha surrounding \"[[ASIN:0060264950 The Rabbits' Wedding]]\" by Garth Williams.  In 1958 the Alabama state library system removed the book from circulation because it featured a black rabbit and a white rabbit getting married.  But sometimes a rabbit is just a rabbit.<br /><br />So is a crayon just a crayon?  I think the difference may lie in what a kid gets out of reading this book.  In the case of \"The Black Rabbit\", few kids are going to equate themselves with fluffy bunnies.  Even if they do, the black rabbit is ultimately the hero of the story.  There's a bit of a difference with crayons.  Kids are constantly coloring themselves and the people they love with the crayons they have on hand.  Crayola, knowing this, even released a brand of multicultural crayons of varying brown tones in response to the public's desire for that very product.  So to produce a book where pink and flesh are equated with skin tones and that possibility isn't even considered with beige or brown makes for a complicated reading.  It's an easy mistake to make if you're not thinking about it at first, but you would have thought that someone in the course of editing this thing might have brought the point up with Mr. Daywalt.  Heck, they might have brought it up with Jeffers too, since he's the one who came up with the naked monster picture in the first place.<br /><br />Getting away from brown, beige, and peach crayons entirely, let's look at the book in terms of its other merits.  When I was a kid I definitely ascribed personalities to inanimate objects.  Not just dolls and toys, oh no.  I could turn a game of War into a long drawn out romantic epic, thanks to the personalities ascribed to various playing cards.  And crayons were no exception.  Each one had a different part to play.  They dealt with jealousies and romances, the whole nine yards.  So in that frame of mind, \"The Day the Crayons Quit\" speaks to something very real.  Kids like to believe that the objects that they play with are as invested in the experience as the kids themselves.  So Daywalt has clearly found a unique but necessary niche.  If he follows the book up with a story of playing cards we'll know he's on the right track.<br /><br />This is also an epistolary picture book.  I don't know if Daywalt knows this, but a common assignment given by a variety of different elementary school teachers requires kids to read epistolary books (\"[[ASIN:0439206634 Dear Mrs. LaRue]]\", \"[[ASIN:0152061185 The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman]]\", etc.).  As such, \"The Day the Crayons Quit\" is no doubt destined to remain on multiple children's book lists for decades and decades to come.<br /><br />Which is a bit of a pity since the book itself is tailor made for an adult readership.  Sure, some kids are going to get a real kick out of it.  But as I read through the book I kept thinking that were it not for the art of Oliver Jeffers, this title would be a difficult read.  After all, it's pretty much all about the words.  Jeffers does what he can to give as much life and vitality as he can to the text, but there are twelve letters in here and around the orange and yellow crayons you'll be forgiven if your attention starts to wane.<br /><br />That's why the success of the book (and success it indeed is) can be ascribed primarily to its illustrator.  I began to notice that the childlike style of the art can really, believably be the style of a kid.  This is undoubtedly why Jeffers was picked for the project in the first place.  Aside from David Shannon it can be difficult to find artists that replicate children's art styles without coming off as half-cooked. Jeffers has also taken great pains to put in as many small clever details as possible, and it makes for a very rewarding rereading.  At first you wouldn't notice.  His Santa on a fire truck is straightforward.  The dragon accidentally burning a clump of grapes is cute but for me the book really picks up with (no surprise here) the moment when Jeffers gets to draw a penguin.  Even the paper he chooses for each crayon is interesting and significant.  Admittedly I was a little surprised that the purple crayon's letter wasn't written on lined paper (since it's such a stickler for staying inside the lines) while the gray crayon's was.  His faux coloring books are fun in and of themselves but it's the final picture that's worth it.  There are a lot of hat tips to the crayons' demands to be found here, from black rainbows to white cats.  I think the character of Duncan still totally forgot to pay heed to blue's request, but otherwise it's on the up and up.  You could even ignore that all the humans are drawn with pink or peach or white crayons, if you had half a mind to.<br /><br />That's sort of what makes the problems I have with the book such a bummer.  There's really good stuff going on here!  Oliver Jeffers is fun to watch no matter what he does and Daywalt has the makings of a fine author for kids.  The troubles come when you look at what the book is saying.  Fans of a certain stripe are sure to disregard my concerns with a wave of their hand.  \"She's reading WAY too much into this\", they might say.  Probably.  But it seems to me that you cannot write a book about crayons and mention peach and pink as naked without acknowledging that not every kid in the world thinks of those colors as a flesh tones.  I mean, that's just obvious.  Here's beige again: \"I am BEIGE and I am proud.\"  Beige power, eh?  Come on, little crayon.

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Well written book but a bit to dark and heavy for me.", "text": "Other reviewers have done an excellent job summarizing the story so I won't go through that.  What I will share is my reaction to the book both as I was reading it and after I finished.<br /><br />I will agree that the book is dark.  The subject matter is deep and heavy and the darkness and heaviness seemed to intensify as the story progressed.  One example of this is in the language choices of the main character, Sergeant DeMarco.  I'm not a cusser so I don't easily overlook the f-word.  It's not a throw-away word to me as it is to many people.  What I noticed is that DeMarco's language became more harsh as the story progressed.  I believe that one of DeMarco's co-workers even pointed that out in the story.  What that said to me was that author wanted to show that this one particular case was taking an unusually great toll on DeMarco.<br /><br />And that to me was really what this story was about.  One troubled person's (DeMarco) struggle with his inner demons and his struggle to deal with them.  It's a very sad story in many ways but not without hope and some resolution.<br /><br />One last thing I'd like to comment on was the author's writing style.  I need to mention that because I struggled with it through the entire time I read the book.  Many of the characters in the book are writers and professors of writing and this book certainly reflects that.  If you are a writer or a writing major of some sort I'm guessing you'll like and appreciate this book more than I did.  I am neither, so I suppose I just didn't get it.  The author is an excellent writer and knows how to turn a phrase and tell a compelling story.  But for some reason I felt like he overdid things, or perhaps tried too hard to use impressive phrases and words.  That, combined with the darkness of the story made it a difficult read.  There were a couple of nights that I was ready and wanting to do a reading binge on this book and just couldn't do it as I needed a break from the story.", "images": [], "asin": "1492639737", "parent_asin": "1492639737", "user_id": "AFWAC4NJFZ55V55ESCI65QLDZOSQ", "timestamp": 1490055677000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}
{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Making The Best Of A Bad Decision", "text": "Decisions! We have to make them every day... from the most mundane to those that help define our lives. Have you ever made a decision you regretted? Did you marry the wrong person? Have you made mistakes that hurt others? Perhaps you made a series of wrong choices and feel like it is too late to ever repair the damage. Can you turn those bad decisions around and make a positive change? Maybe you just think it is too late to start fresh or to make amends. You can get forgiveness from God and restore your relationship with Him, and there is always hope of restoring broken relationships with others. Whether it is one mistake or a lifetime habit of mistakes, you can move past your regrets and move forward.  Pastor and bestselling author Erwin Lutzer will show you how to make the best of even your worst decisions.<br /><br />This is a good book, but not a great book. Part of my slight disappointment may be because I feel like I have read these same examples time after time. On the other hand, it is not fair to fault Pastor Lutzer just because I have read many books. It is a honest appraisal of moving beyond the poor decisions, and accepting that there are consequences to face due to those decisions. He is very clear that forgiveness from God does not mean a complete do-over. For example, if you have robbed a bank and are truly repentant to both mankind and God, you are still most likely to spend time in prison. However, God will forgive you for being a thief. Lutzer's final chapter is based on the only truly bad decision you will make, and provides sound advice on how to make the correct decision. The brief discussion guide in the back can be used whether you study alone or with a group, and is most useful in reinforcing the lessons learned.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book from Tyndale House Publishers  in exchange for this review.", "images": [], "asin": "1414311435", "parent_asin": "1414311435", "user_id": "AFH75OQDZOXFY2YB5YNDDWCQVXWQ", "timestamp": 1305747590000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 0, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Ideological, Clich\u00e9, Anecdotal, Weak", "text": "I have often read Thomas Sowell's columns and find his views interesting and well-reasoned. I regret that I cannot say that for this book.<br /><br />First of all, the book is primarily an ideological attack on schools in the US. The title suggests that Sowell has some inside view of the system, but he does not. He is not a public school teacher and never was. He is an Ivy-League-educated college professor of economics. He has no insight into the education system of the US. Instead, he has collected three sorts of evidence on which he bases his opinions. The first is statistical reports of various kinds, including those which show American children are outperformed by those in other countries in such areas as mathematics. The second are opinions from an unending stream of books condemning American education for its failures. The third is anecdotes.<br /><br />A good researcher would never rely on anecdotes. They prove nothing at all, and a selection of anecdotes may point to whatever conclusion the author has previously held and wishes to support.<br /><br />A good researcher would set aside the opinions of others, no matter how many might be found, as irrelevant to the facts at hand.<br /><br />A good researcher would be cautious about interpreting statistics. I know from personal experience (I taught in South Korea for eight years) that the amazing success of Korean students on international math exams is due to three factors -- none of which is the quality of public schools in Korea. The first is a culture that for 500 years has used a national exam to determine who would obtain the most coveted positions in the society. This has produced a system in which education is of little importance if it does not lead to high test scores -- and one in which cheating to obtain such scores is far too common. I have seen students who were barely able to speak or write a sentence in English score near the top on the SAT writing test by memorizing passages and learning how to arrange them to respond to a wide variety of questions -- trained by a private test-preparation professional. The second factor is the reliance of an estimated 75% of all students on a system of private businesses which are dedicated to test preparation. Students often spend five nights a week in private classes from 4 pm to 10 pm, and attend additional daytime classes during the vacations. The third is repeated testing which produces test-wise students and is enhanced by private coaching on test-taking methods and the use of countless sample exams.<br /><br />One of the statistics that Sowell relies on is a decline in SAT scores from the 1960s to the 1980s (he was writing in the early 1990s). What is often ignored is that the test changed during this period. So the actual measurement, which might have remained a constant had it been normed each year, but did not, ise a ruler that changed its length in an unpredictable way. It cannot be used to measure comparative performance. One might note that blacks and Hispanics did better during this period, whites did worse -- which might suggest that a shift in cultural bias may have occurred.<br /><br />Those unhappy with US public schools or US universities and colleges, and I am surely one, might be quite pleased with the anecdotes and the prestige of its author if they are willing to read uncritically. Neither will satisfy a critical reader.<br /><br />As for Sowell's prescription for curing the nation of its academic ills, he offers little. He does see the problems, which go far beyond the ideological concerns he expresses, but he has no real clue as to what can reasonably be done about them. Like the many other critics I have read, he has a birds-eye view and can do no more than leave his droppings on the heads of those below.", "images": [], "asin": "0029303303", "parent_asin": "0029303303", "user_id": "AE5FULT73C4657GJFZMSOFSBJKLQ", "timestamp": 1436847856000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false}
{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Flawed by Factual Errors", "text": "It's hard to believe I first wrote this review almost ten years ago. Since then,  thanks to the miracle of the internet and in research for my own book (in which Grenada will take up a few chapters) of my military experiences, I've learned more about the operation from fellow veterans and Retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant Joe Muccia, who is researching his own book on the battle. In fairness to Major Adkins and the reader I believe I should update my review based on this new information.<br /><br />I've heard numerous times that this is the best book on Operation Urgent Fury, the U.S. led invasion of Grenada. If so, this makes me sad.<br /><br />As a participant of the operation (I was eating my wife's birthday cake when I received the alert notice to go) I bring an eyewitness perspective to many of the events the author describes.  I was a Sergeant assigned as a gunner to a howitzer section with Battery B, 1/320th FA (Airborne), 82nd Airborne Division.  We were part of the first battalion task force from the 82nd to deploy to the island.<br /><br />Most accounts of the battle have been flawed - most unable to even get the order of battle right. My unit is usually listed at Battery B, 2/325 Infantry - which in deployment was tactically true but wrong. Even though we deployed as part of Task Force 2/325, we were still for all intent and purposes B 1/320th. I do like what one 2/325 commander did when he presented us with a guidon calling us D Battery 2/325.  This may seem a minor detail but Truth is like a fine suit, if one thread comes loose, the entire garment can unravel. Others have either hyped the battle to the point of being a mini-Iwo Jima, or worse, demeaned it to the point of being a bad joke. I believe both points of view are both wrong - and unfair.<br /><br />So, having heard about Major Adkins' book on the subject, learning he had been there, and how good it was, I approached this work with some anticipation. There were many questions in my mind which have been unanswered, lo this past (has it really been that long?) twenty-four years; I longed for a good book with an overall point of view to make some of the things make sense. After all, I was a witness to these events, but I had a worm's eye view.<br /><br />And indeed, when I first opened Major Adkin's book I was satisfied. He paints a compelling story of the events leading up to the operation. We were never really briefed on the &#34;why&#34; of why we went, in our briefings. I was aware from our threat briefing that there was unrest on the island, the government had been overthrown, and there was concern for the safety of American students on the island. However, Adkins does an admirable job of filling in the gaps.<br /><br />I am grateful to Major Adkins for making a clear argument that the bombing in Beirut had little or nothing to do with Reagan's decision to go into Grenada. This has been much brought up by those who would love to tarnish Reagan's legacy as President.<br /><br />However, I am disturbed when Adkins describes actions in which I was a participant, and I find his description of events don't match my recollections. If I'm going to criticize hs work, it's only fair I back up my criticism with facts so let me bring up some cases in point:<br /><br />He does an excellent job in describing the confusion surrounding the deployment. My own detachment from my battery was &#34;stood up&#34; and then &#34;stood down&#34; several times before finally being given the &#34;go.&#34; We had even been in the process of putting on parachutes to jump in and then told to take them off and turn them in.<br /><br />When I finally did get the word we were going there was still confusion. In my pocket I had a Xeroxed tourist map of the island (which I now wish I had kept), as there were no military maps available. When I boarded my aircraft as senior man on board I was told we were going to Barbados to link up and organize with the rest of our unit before either jumping or airmobiling in to Grenada. Imagine my surprise when I landed on Grenada in the middle of sniper fire. That was Urgent Fury.<br /><br /> I begin to disagree with his account of the rescue of students at the Grand Anse campus. My battery fired the artillery prep for that mission. I have since learned there were airstrikes, but once again, he neglects the participation of the US Army Airborne Artillery just as he did when he either ignored, or was unaware of, the action of our 3rd Section Howitzer in providing pinpoint fire support for the action in taking the Cuban barracks. Our gunfire was used by the air assets to mark the target. Prior to our gun firing there had been genuine fear of hitting friendlies. Our third sections rounds provided the guide for the jets to hone in on. As at the Cuban barracks, throughout the battle there was a genuine fear of hitting the students or collateral damage, which we did our best to keep at a minimum. This would also explain his swipe at how &#34;slow&#34; we (the 82nd) moved. We were under orders to win the hearts and minds of the Grenadian people; you don't do it by blitzing urban areas and wiping out everything in your path. Frustrating for a soldier, but a political necessity. At Grand Anse the Ranger commander commended us on one of the best artillery preps he'd seen in his entire career. How could we do so well at Grand Anse and so poorly at Calvigny?<br /><br />His assertion we left our aiming circles behind when we deployed is not only untrue, but ludicrous. I don't know where he heard that from. As a gunner I was responsible for &#34;laying&#34; my piece for azimuth of fire. It was Division Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for both battery commanders - and Executive Officers of  firing batteries to jump in with an Aiming Circle strapped to their legs if we jumped in. I personally saw our aiming circles on the island and used them to lay my piece and have several pictures  of our aiming circles and other aiming equipment on the island.<br /><br />So it was NOT because we on the guns or in the firing batteries failed  to bring proper fire support equipment. I have several pictures of our guns on the island that include our aiming devices and the M-2 aiming circle which was used to &#34;lay&#34; our battery for proper azimuth (direction) of fire. Even had we forgotten or lost our aiming circles or aiming points (collimators and aiming posts) 82nd Field Artillerymen were among the best trained in the Army (and certainly the best I worked with) we could have laid our guns by compass and used any stationary landmark as an aiming reference. (I don't mean to get too technical here, but trying to illustrate how ludicrous this charge is).<br /><br />Which brings us to the foul-up on the Calvigny Mission. At first I found it hard to believe we could have been allowed to expend so many rounds when we were missing the target - particularly after the commendations we received for the great job we did on that particular mission(!). There was an intense discussion with Joe Muccia and several of my fellow artillerymen, some of whom were officers during the battle and in a good position to know.  Joe had closely studied the after-action reports, and had previous discussions with others who were in a better position than I to know what went wrong (including the Fire Support Officer for the Rangers, who later became our battery commander). Further discussion with us led us to the conclusion that the designated targets and fire support plan had been submitted to our Fire Control Centers and they, in turn, created a good fire support plan for the operation. However, someone at the  top changed the data at the last minute which caused our rounds to miss the target. As the three firing batteries involved co-ordinated our fire together, if one was wrong we all were. On the guns, we could only fire the data given us as we could not see our targets. If our rounds missed the target it was because we were given the wrong targets. I will not name who we believe changed the targets and the why remains a mystery to me.<br /><br />The conclusion is, the foul-up was again in command and control, not on the troop level.<br /><br />So I have to agree with Major Adkins the operation was bureaucratic SNAFU at the top. However, he appears to relish every mistake made by the American high command while giving short shrift to the things done right at the bottom.  Perhaps I am overly sensitive to criticism after enduring years of it. But one must remember, we hadn't been to war in over ten years; many of the things learned in Vietnam were forgotten in the years of peace between. The military had just come out of at least four years neglect from 1977 -1981, morale had been low, readiness at an all-time low.<br /><br />As a former commander of the 82nd MG James Lindsay (who I wished had commanded us in Grenada) was fond of saying, &#34;We have eighteen hours to go to war. That's not a lot of time to get smarter, faster, or better - you go with what you got!&#34;  Unlike soldiers in most other wars, we didn't have time to learn from our mistakes. We went with what we had. Major Adkins attributes our victory to pure dumb luck. I've never been much of a believer in dumb luck. I discovered one makes his own luck, usually. I think the troopers and Marines on that island made ours.<br /><br />He appears to have an open disdain, even dislike for the troopers of the 82nd. He neglects to mention the two engineers from the 82nd who jumped in with the rangers and were instrumental in clearing the wreckage from the airstrip in a timely manner.  It is true, that at first, there was problem keeping the guys in proper uniforms. It was hot, we were, indeed, clothed in uniforms ill-suited for a tropical environment (you go with what you got), as an NCO I insisted that my troops at least keep their helmets and flak vests on and that they not have their M-16A1 any farther than arms' length from them at all times.  I believe most NCOs got the guys in line fairly quick. The &#34;magic&#34; helmet, which saved a trooper's life by stopping an AK bullet helped immensely. I never had a problem getting my guys to keep their helmets on after that was passed around.<br /><br /> He does mention the reason the marines were able to move so quickly on the island was the fact they met little or no opposition in the north, while we faced the brunt of the opposition and were moving through an urban environment with strict orders to limit collateral damage and civilian casualties. But we were moving. After Calvigny, the artillery's role was to &#34;lay&#34; on targets to be ready to fire if needed as the infantry would move into a new area and clear it.  When the area was declared &#34;safe&#34; we would adjust accordingly to the next area. We did this frequently. Someone was moving.<br /><br />I also believe the Marine's presence in the North, forming a vice or pincers-like movement did a great deal to reduce casualties by depriving any who had the idea of fleeing into the hills and jungle from having an avenue of escape.<br /><br />There is also some discussion as to the sheer numbers of troops sent to the island. I appreciate his explanation of the reason, though I don't remember him mentioning another real possibility that occurred to us on the island- the idea that Castro might have tried to reinforce his Grenadian allies. Remember, at the time we didn't know what the relationship between Castro and the Coard faction was, we were told by the Grenadian people that the Cubans had helped the PRA terrorize the people. I was told this personally by Grenadian citizens who were grateful we came.<br /><br />When our current leaders are being criticized for not sending enough troops to Iraq, pardon me if I scratch my head in confusion. The Iraq war is being criticized for taking too long and and causing too many casualties, Grenada is ridiculed because it was over too fast and didn't cause many casualties.  Where's the logic in that?<br /><br />His book, written in 1989, criticizes the Army people for wanting to eliminate every pocket of resistance instead of moving rapidly around them and driving on to the main objective. Reading the book in 2007, please excuse me if I find his criticism ironic because our operation in Iraq in 2003 is being criticized for the exact opposite reason: our troops bypassed pockets of resistance allowing them to melt into the landscape and organize a guerilla/terrorist resistance. Perhaps Iraq now proves our commanders on Grenada to be wise? But what do I know?  I'm just a cannon cocker.<br /><br />Also, the book, written and researched in 1989 could not have known the impact Grenada had on our training and doctrine. Glaring shortcomings, particularly in interservice communications and cooperation were shown. These were corrected in the mid to late 80s. My last assignment before being medically retired for a parachute injury from the Army was to work in XVIII Airborne Corps G-3, planning and operations section. The US military conducted numerous interservice exercises and operations and worked hard to correct the deficiencies evident in Grenada. I believe Grenada (and I have discovered since first writing this there are many experts who agree now) paved the way for later victories in Panama and the Persian Gulf.<br /><br />Grenada also served notice to our enemies that the U.S. would no longer cower in the shadow of Vietnam and that there would be no more easy victories for the communists. Remember, we were losing the Cold War in 1980. We'd won it by 1989. I believe Grenada and several other smaller, forgotten actions played a part in that victory. I do know that in 2003, on the twentieth anniversary of the battle, the US Army recognized the battle as the turning point in the Cold War. It was the only time a Communist government was removed by direct military action and it marked the end of Communist expansion during the era after a period in which no less than fifteen nations fell to communist revolutions or coups (1975 fall of Saigon and 1983 Grenada); the importance of the battle far outweighs the number of troops involved or casualties.<br /><br />So, having vented my spleen on this book, what is my final judgment? For the factual errors I have noted above, it is to be approached with care. If he was wrong on these things I know about, what other facts did he get wrong?<br /><br />It is written well, but as stated before, I believe the author appears to have a bias against US special operations troops, this is mentioned by another reviewer, so I was relieved it wasn't just my own sensitivities.  He appears to take great relish in describing the mistakes made by the American high command, while glossing over the things that were done right.<br /><br />If there was a problem with the SpecOps people in Grenada I don't believe it was with the troops - they (as were we all) were sent in with lousy intelligence and a minimum of planning. Perhaps, considering the circumstances, it was unavoidable. True, there was a lot that went wrong in that operation, but there was also a lot that went right. I was told at Bragg before leaving to expect a six month deployment ala the Dominican Republic. I was there ten days. I believe the book doesn't give enough credit to the guys on the ground who prevented the admitted SNAFU from becoming FUBAR.<br /><br />There are those who make snide comments about the &#34;12 hour war,&#34; or those who call the operation a joke. Well, it may not have lasted long, but our dead are still dead, and our maimed are still maimed. And the people of Grenada celebrate October 25, the anniversary of the invasion, as their Thanksgiving Day. I see nothing funny in that.<br /><br />It is sad that this is the best account of the battle to come forth thus far.

In fact, I was rather angry and put the book away.  However, about a week later I realized I was curious and started reading again.  I actually ended up enjoying the second part of the book more than the first.  I still would not consider this book better than just &#34;okay&#34; though for these reasons: 1. Moving the events forward in time can be done successfully by a skilled writer; he did not manage that here.  I think the main problem was that he changed not just the time, but the pacing of the story was completely different, and the characters were all new as well.  The main character in the first  part of the book, Amy, plays a secondary role in the latter half.  That doesn't make much sense.  2. He can't get to the point and belabors minute details.  3.  He keeps killing characters.  Even though we have learned about their lives in excruciating detail and have to come to care about them.  It's a bit rude. 4. The ending.  I read The Passage after The Twelve was already out, so I accepted the teaser ending.  However, it still annoying.<br />This should have been 2 different books and it is way too long.  But, overall, I did enjoy the story and the characters despite the mediocre execution of the novel.  (I should also say that The Twelve is really bad and I cannot recommend it at all.

Even prior to reading it I almost wanted to give the book a 5 stars review based on its content alone. But then I actually started reading the book.<br /><br />a) the authors are very bad at writing. It reads very much like they wrote the book, then went back and opened up a thesaurus... and replaced all the words with synonyms and near-rhymes. It's not that the words used are too big and confusing. In replacing all the words with thesaurus words the words are actually used incorrectly, and the meaning has been thrown off.<br /><br />b) the coverage of the various topics is completely shallow and useless. My honest opinion is I don't believe the authors even understand the content they're discussing, I think they were probably given a list of topics to discuss and they just quickly googled some of them and scrapped a paragraph together. It reads like a school paper that you would write 4 hours before the deadline. The thoughts do not flow together, there is no depth at all, in many cases you can't even make out what they're trying to say. It is absolutely horribly done.<br />Many of the sentences are copied word for word from wikipedia, other books on the topic (which I knew because I'd read them), random websites (the first to show up on google when you search the topic), etc.. Just further evidence that the authors threw together some sentences quickly and had no idea what they were saying. Honestly the authors didn't deserve to be paid for writing this book, I could write a better book and I don't even know all this stuff.<br /><br />The best thing about this book, by far, is the table of contents. It's thorough and covers all the essential topics of architectural design patterns. You will not be able to glean any useful information out of this book. But what you could do is go through the table of contents & buy the respected books on these various topics.

I mean, Lena is even a gym spaz.<br /><br />But I quickly came to the point that I had to force myself to read it.  The whole deal with the guardian angels really confused me.

But for average students of classics, you will be far better served by looking for a copy of &#34;The Antigone of Sophocles&#34; (with greek text and commentary) by Richard C. Jebb (Author) and E. S. Shuckburgh (abridgment editor). It is an abridged version of Jebb's famous commentary on Antigone. It has the right amount of information for a learner to gain a better comprehension of the greek text. I compared the two commentaries and found myself using Jebb's commentary almost exclusively. Jeff's commentary came out in 1928 and has long been out of print. But if you are quick, there are still used copies in good condition available from Amazon sellers. I got mine for just $ 4.50 and I love it. The current commentary by Griffith is not all that bad. It incorporates &#34;new scholarship&#34; on greek tragedy. But I find it unbearably verbose. The truth is that classics study reached its peak at around the period from the beginning of the 20th century till Second World War. Best commentaries were produced around that time. Modern classical scholarship doesn't quite match the rigor of what it used to be 60-70 years ago. The survival of classics should mean making scholarly works from the first half of the 20th century (whose copyright has expired) available at affordable prices.

No, now it is true love and oh! since she's available now (strange coincidence)he can go get her back!<br /><br />Angered? Yes I was, but I could have been fine with this upset that is until she dismissed the Fool. All that happens, all that they were put through and the sacrifices that they made for one another and yet in the end he is completely dismissed form Fitz's life as just another sad memory, another regret? No, that I couldn't stand. The Fool loved him, that was made clear long ago and yet now that they are closer than they have ever been he can simply leave? I understand that he was put under a trumendous ordeal, but even that pales to the sudden attitude the Fool has at the end and really the only word I can think of to describe it is exactly that \"a dismissal\".<br /><br />Starting at the scene before Girl-on-a-Dragon and leading up to the cabin and Fitz's diparture the book begins to fall apart.

His sentences often didn't seem complete (missing/implied pronouns) and there were many others from which I could drive no meaning even after repeated readings.<br /><br />The first one hundred or so pages I felt lost with no key to unlocking the secret code.  A glossary of the authors invented terms/processes/items would have helped immensely.  I would have given up early on if I hadn't been reading this for my local book club meeting.  I gave up on trying to understand much of what Mr. Gibson was writing, and settle for following the basics of the plot line, which I did enjoy.<br /><br />The story starts in some point after 2023 in the United States.  Flynne Fisher is an ex-gamer, but just this once she agrees to sub for her brother and work his shift beta testing a game.  Well, she does it again the next night and this time all doesn't go so well.  Some one in the game is killed in a gruesome manner and she begins to question whether it really is a game.<br /><br />The story skips back and forth between Flynne's time and a future time, about seventy years from them.  In the future, Wilf Netherton has some involvement with the death that occurred and it's important to him to protect Flynne from any backlash from that event.<br /><br />The character of Flynne is well developed and I found her down to earth and likable.  She is very family oriented and ethical.  She sticks to her morals even when large amounts of money are waved in front of her face.  My other favourite character is Conner, a long time friend who is ex-military with multiple crippling war injuries.  He's in your face, does what he needs to with no apologies.<br /><br />This story made me ponder the role of technology in society.

The idea of a down-on-his-luck, talented Parisian architect during the Nazi occupation getting involved in designing spaces to harbor Jews is ingenious and a story I very much wanted to like.  If the author could have drafted his prose more simply and designed a nuanced change of heart for this architect as cleverly as he designed his buildings, this could have been a bestseller.", "images": [], "asin": "B00DJBXASQ", "parent_asin": "B00DJBXASQ", "user_id": "AGX3J6OPYMXRAVVYJQRYMLF2KX2Q", "timestamp": 1388948194000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": true}

This is a concise, entertaining look at the 40-year history of the franchise that you'll read in a couple of sittings. The book was published in 2007 so lame duck team owner, John Moores, who drove the franchise into the ground the last five years is referred to quite positively. Even so, Padres Essential is a valuable read.<br /><br />Padres Essential was published the same year as Bob Chandler's Tales From The San Diego Padres Dugout but it's far and away the superior publication. \"Tales\" was written at an eighth grade level while Padres Essential  was written for adults and has more material. My biggest gripe about \"Tales\" was it never even mentioned the greatest Padres tale; Goose Gossage lambasting team owner Joan Kroc in 1986 for removing beer from the clubhouse. Center at least mentions the incident although not in any detail.<br /><br />Most seasons we Padres fans are only hoping for a .500 season so we've learned not to aim too high.

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "A blood- soaked trail from Mexico to Texas", "text": "&#34; The House of the Rising Sun&#34; by James Lee Burke is a story set in Texas and takes place in the years just after the turn of the 20th. century. It's hero is Hackberry Holland, former Texas Ranger and  town Marshall, though hero may be the wrong word to describe him.<br />In most western stories, the hero is a man who can be described as a good man to have as a friend and a bad one to have as an enemy.  Think of Shane of the classic movie western. Hack Holland, however, is a bad man to have as a friend and worse to have as an enemy.<br />He is a sociopath, possibly a psychopath, an alcoholic with muderous rages in which he is quite likely to beat a man to the ground and keep pounding on him until the red mists before his eyes fades away. Not a man to mess with-- or love. That is the main character of this book.<br />Moreover, there is not one of the important characters in the book who is much better. Lust , greed, revenge, willful pride are the motivating factors of the story, which is saying something, considering it is about a search for the Holy Grail. Yes that Holy Grail. Hack finds it, and the one who had it wants it back and wants it badly enough to kill and torture his way through Mexico and Texas to get it.<br />That being said, &#34;The House of the Rising Sun&#34; is one heck of a novel.<br />Mr. Burke writes beautifully, compelling the reader to pay attention. He paints colorful landscapes for his novel,  with  the hill country of Texas and the sere Mexican  desert hardly big enough to contain the action. His characters,even the supporting players, to use a movie term, live on the pages, at least until someone kills them.Burke somehow, but with great skill, even makes Hack Holland a sympathetic character, as he combats his homicidal urges, wallows in his remorse for his treatment of his family and contemplates a life without one friend to his name.<br />Burke gets a bit of philosophical musing in, writing, &#34;.Was not all mankind adrift on a dark sea, without hope, at the mercy of undercurrents, waves big as mountains....&#34; At one time, when Hack's woman, the mother of his son finds him in a cage, drunk, beaten and filthy, his recent war wounds barely healed over, she &#34;  ...takes his weight across her thighs, his arms hanging loose...the bones of his chest prominent....&#34; A Pieta - like scene. Burke does like to use purple prose to paint a powerful picture.<br /><br />I had not read too much of Burke's  work before this book, maybe one or two of the Robicheaux thrillers. This one was certainly different and I will look into more of the Hack Holland books just to see how he became the man he was.<br /><br />Recommended , with the warning there  violent and sometimes disturbing scenes. Also sexual references, though no graphic sex. Also some late night, last drink before closing the bar down,philosophical musing going on to try to raise the level from a hell-bent western.", "images": [], "asin": "1501107100", "parent_asin": "1501107100", "user_id": "AEZ332RDO5FCMRGT3PD2XFJPP2AQ", "timestamp": 1451879144000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

It's an excellent story but, I just had some issues with the writing style. It's a style that one reviewer describes as a &#34;hot mess&#34;. I tend to agree.<br /><br />Commonwealth, begins with a christening party in Southern, CA for Fix and Beverly Keating's second child, Franny. At the party there are far too many people, too much alcohol and an uninvited guest who works with Fix that shows up.  Before the evening is up, two families will be torn apart.<br /><br />Bert Cousins, is the uninvited guest. He's a man who can't deal with spending his weekend with his three small kids and pregnant wife.  He leaves home and shows up at the party with a bottle of gin.  Bert has always been a womanizer and at this event it's Beverly Keating who proves just too irresistible for Bert. One kiss, and a mutual instant attraction and soon two fractured families.  Bert and Beverly move from CA back to Bert's home state of VA.<br /><br />The title &#34;Commonwealth&#34; is significant and, the story follows the children and adults of these marriages through middle and old age.  The family saga is large in scope. It's complicated, dysfunctional and even tragic. Yet, despite the sad parts, at times I found myself laughing as I read.

Somehow even the bad parts seemed a little saccharine.<br />I listened to half of it and had to put it down.<br />I didn\u2019t give it one star because the writing is beautiful and parts and creative and original and the characters are likable. It\u2019s just not deep enough for me at this stage of life.<br />I have absolutely  no idea what bad language other reviewers are referring to as the audiobook had none of that.<br />The narration was excellent.", "images": [], "asin": "B01N1GCCHI", "parent_asin": "B01N1GCCHI", "user_id": "AHVSKOZXKLW3C4UQA3ACRWHBHFBA", "timestamp": 1583258107729, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "When Life Gives You Lemons", "text": "This is the upbeat telling of an Olympic gymnast's life story. From athletic triumph to confronting cancer, she applies herself one hundred percent. The best parts are when she recounts her Olympic success.  But she tends to gloss over the unpleasant and difficult times in her life including her marital disappointments. There is a lack of depth and introspection and while I certainly applauded her bright and cheerful attitude and  admired her many accomplishments, I did not find myself involved with her or her story at any meaningful level. I suppose that part of the cheerful veneer is being in the public eye at a tender age and part is for protection. She is an appropriate role model for young girls and those with a strong interest in gymnastics will enjoy this book. It is nicely written and readable but for me, the lemonade was just a bit too sweet.", "images": [], "asin": "1250049865", "parent_asin": "1250049865", "user_id": "AH665SQ6SQF6DXAGYIQFCX76LALA", "timestamp": 1424118200000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
