{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I dunno, electricity is nice.", "text": "This review originally published on the DRTTMK website.<br /><br />It's kind of a maudlin book. The main character is the personification of a little house that is built out in the country. \"The man who built her so well said, 'This Little House shall never be sold for gold or silver and she will live to see our great-great-grandchildren's great-great-grandchildren living in her.\" It talks about how the house is in the countryside, and at night she watches the stars, and what it's like in the different seasons. She hears about the city and kind of wonders what it's like. \"One day the little house was surprised to see a horseless carriage coming down the winding country road.\" Then they build a road next to her, and build more houses and gas stations, and then more roads, apartments... Everything crowds around her, but no one wants to live in her so she just kind of stays there. There's a trolley that goes by her, and an elevated train in a subway, and then they tear down the apartments and tenements next to her and build up skyscrapers, and she feels terrible and nobody's living in her and she's all broken down. Then one day, \"Along came the great-great-granddaughter of the man who built the little house so well.\" And she says, 'Hey, it looks kind of like my grandmother's house when she was a little girl, except that was out in the countryside.' And they realize that the area used to be countryside, but isn't anymore. Then they go to some movers and the movers say, 'Yeah, the house is well built so we can move the house somewhere else.' So they put her on a truck and take her out in the middle of the countryside and paint her and fix her up and then she's happy again.<br /><br />It's another one of those books decrying industrialization. If you think about it, that little house built back before cars and before any roads were in the area wouldn't have had air conditioning or central heat. It probably didn't even have indoor plumbing if it was so isolated. Obviously, it could be retrofitted, but the book just seems nostalgic for the past, like it's saying that things were better back when everything was countryside and we didn't have roads and cars and things like that. But there's so many trade-offs that it doesn't take into account, and it's a very simplistic and naive way of looking at the world. It just boils down to a house that likes living in the country, and then the country changes to a city, and then somebody takes her back to the country so she's happy again. Looking at it from the house's standpoint, it's a perfectly reasonable story. It's not great, but not bad. And it's rather dated.<br /><br />Message: Some houses prefer to be in the countryside.", "images": [], "asin": "039525938X", "parent_asin": "039525938X", "user_id": "AH4XKRSSSWAO6CZ5WH66V6PIQJTA", "timestamp": 1566913208013, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Sounds like a good story, right? Well, it would have been, except that the bulk of the story consists of Hippolyte trying to convince his editor that his journey was fact and not fiction, as she believes. This is done mostly through letters and notes of historical facts sent back and forth. The &quot;finding the islands&quot; part was way too small, and the rest of the book was sooo boring that any mystery etc. regarding these islands is overshadowed by the simple fact that I didn't want to read on. Also, there is some kind of completely unbelievable romance type thing beginning between Hippolyte and his editor Marie that begins to make the book a little bit more interesting, but it never fully develops into anything. Because I paid full price for this book, I forced myself to finish it. I must say that the illustrations did distract from the boredom of the continuous facts and figures in the book, thus raising it's rating from two to three stars.

Then I started working in film production and realized what a bunch of malarkey all this film theory is!  Disillusioning, yeah, but so what?  Films are produced through hell and high water, and every single one that gets made (even the awful ones) is a miracle.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Hip re-envisioning of classical mythology", "text": "Amelia (after Earhart), the self-named first-person narrator of the Children of Chaos trilogy, is a quirky, gutsy young woman who learns, early in ORPHANS OF CHAOS, that she can see into and move through dimensions beyond the three that normal folks perceive. It turns out that she and her companions are hostages against the good behavior of their parents, partisans of the Titans, the gods who in classical mythology overthrew the first generation of gods and were in turn overturned by the third generation. Virtually all of the characters can be found in references on classical mythology. For reasons not yet clear, the ages-old war between generations of gods is being fought out (at least in part) on present-day earth. The hostages yearn for freedom, and slowly recognize they can use their powers to escape their captors.<br /><br />I was initially impressed with the way Wright handled speaking in the voice of a teenage girl. I was therefore deeply disappointed when, around p. 150, it turns out that spunky and self-possessed Amelia actually longs to be dominated by men, ordered around by men, and punished by men. Wright explains her appetite for domination as a result of supernatural attack, but the sexual politics of Amelia's desires (and Wright's fixations on bondage and spanking) taint the book. I also found the constant sexual banter uncharacteristic for a group of children who grew up together in such close quarters; I would expect more caution and respect among them. If I recall correctly, Wright's sexual politics were also pretty bad in his Golden Age series. This is particularly disappointing in a lauded young writer.<br /><br />While ORPHANS OF CHAOS has many flaws, it is nevertheless enjoyable and provocative (when it's not outright offensive). I like it better so far than his Golden Age trilogy, which also drew quite a bit on classical mythology. I hesitate to recommend the book because of its backwards sexual politics and annoying sexual banter, but I can't entirely condemn it either.

I think Kevin and Brian's work has been overall great and they have continued to breathe life into the greatest SciFi series ever. I would put Hosue Corrino, House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and Butlerian Jihad up against any of the Dune books after the original any day of the week.<br /><br />That said this book was even worse than Sisterhood of Dune (the previous book). Here are a few brief problems I had, I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum.<br /><br />- Hyla and Andros. How in the hell do you not include these characters from Sisterhood in this book? They were the 2 most compelling antagonist's in the previous book and you had them eaten by sandworms half way through Sisterhood. I expected them to come back in Mentat's but sadly they never did. This was a colossal waste and frankly, bewildering.<br /><br />- Cymeks. So we are to understand that the most brilliant businessman in the galaxy (Venport), a man fighting the rise of the Butlerian movement (anti-tech / thinking machines) seeks to turn the public view in his favor by creating and releasing new versions of Cymeks to kill humans? Really? His plan to rally humanity on his side is to resurrect the technology that enslaved them? This was not logical writing.<br /><br />- The Sisterhood. Two Books, both putting a lot of weight and writing into who the chosen successor of the Sisterhood would be and the writers decide, oh, let's just make it both Vayla and Doretta at the end. That was the best solution you could come up with? Talk about a letdown.<br /><br />- Emperor Corrino. His whole character was just hollow. House Corrino did such an amazing job on covering palace intrigue and the secrets of state that I just don't think anything  regarding the Emperor or his brother Roderick in this book was interesting at all. The authors seemed to just throw in some cruelty to make the Emperor more interesting but he was neutered the entire book and his brother Roderick while capable, just didn't have anything to do in the book.<br /><br />- The Fremen. They were pretty much nonexistent in this book and the last. It follows 1 small group of Fremen who try to take up work in the Emperium away from their Sietch. Boring, obvious, and completely pointless to the story. They clearly just threw in some Fremen at the last minute.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Completely unoriginal", "text": "There was some promise in the blurb of this book, which is why I picked it up to read, but then I realized it was just a rehash and remix of a bunch of other stories. *The Point* tells the story of a young adult who is wasting her amazing potential until a dramatic event gives her a choice of either going through a grueling training she doesn\u2019t want or getting a punishment. But as it turns out our reluctant protagonist turns out to be the great promising future for her people, especially since the vaguely hinted antagonist has the potential power to bring about an apocalypse. That makes our hero the one true future hope. Nevertheless, she must endure antagonism from her jealous classmates as well as incredibly cruel treatment from the teachers she\u2019s supposed to trust. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Yes, *The Point* is a mix of Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and the Divergent series with an antagonist who is a straight rip-off of Jessica Jones\u2019 Killgrave. The only thing unique here is the setting which is not quite West Point, but a secret alt-version of the Point just for superhumans buried under the real West Point. But it was never adequately explained why this was placed there, why they were training these people to be officers, especially since most of them\u2014apart from their powers\u2014seemed profoundly not to be Army officer material.<br /><br />Then there are the editorial problems. I can only hope that the review copy I read wasn\u2019t the final version because it wasn\u2019t just typos. At one point, several of the characters must have been different genders because, for paragraphs at a time, the wrong pronouns were used. At another point, the author forgot he told us that the character had a pretty good buzz, because then a couple pages later he tells us that she hasn\u2019t yet got a buzz on. Speaking of which, our protagonist is 18 years old and yet she drinks with no problem in a bar outside of West Point, while the author had just had someone telling another character they couldn\u2019t drink because of being underage. So why could our hero drink? No explanation. Those may seem like minor problems, but they are just a couple examples of the many structural and editing issues with this book.<br /><br />But what most put me off of this book was the incredible casual cruelty. What is it with young adult literature these days that they must always combine world-shattering stakes with incredible cruelty to the protagonist and their companions, not by their enemies, but the people who are supposed to be their mentors. Why can\u2019t we tell smaller stories? Not there shouldn\u2019t be important stakes, but what about consequences that are important to just, say, the protagonist. Okay, put their life on the line. But why must every story be about an incredibly evil enemy who must be destroyed to save the universe? It gets boring after a while.<br /><br />Bottom line is that *The Point* is not a book I can recommend.", "images": [], "asin": "1101967560", "parent_asin": "1101967560", "user_id": "AFWOJPC5VKJY4OGDKU2ICCWUAMBA", "timestamp": 1534016375460, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Skip it...", "text": "I listened to the audio book and the narrator Kyle McCarley did a fantastic job. He is the only reason why I finished the book. Because if I had read this it would've been DNF less than 50 pages in.<br /><br />This book is the a reminder for me to be careful what I wish for. The last couple of books I read were sorely lacking in world building, this book took it too far. I could see everything because the details were written that intricately. To the point of boredom. Rooms, clothes, jewelry. Names of titles of nobles, religious leaders, and ceremonies were invented. Which is great, but there were so many it was hard to keep track. Standard names like Lord and Priest would've worked too for lesser characters. I also found it weird that all these intricate names and ceremonies were created, but the animals were standard. And although there was mention of magic there wasn't any in this book.<br /><br />Maia, our hero was boring. The standard orphan forced out of seclusion. The problem is there was nothing outstanding about him. He was nice, but no saint. He was smart, but no genius. He wasn't ugly by Elf society standards, but he was no great beauty either. There was nothing about him that stood out. Nothing to make the reader root for him to \"win\". He was a competent ruler, but no champion of the people. If they had killed him off and replaced him at any point in the book I honestly wouldn't have cared.<br /><br />That is another problem with this story. For one that focused on political intrigue and court politics it was lacking both. Starting with our main character. His banishment being accepted by everyone made no sense. His mother a goblin was married to his father to foster an alliance. So her being banished with her baby right after giving birth for the crime of not being an Elf was beyond stupid. Her father the Goblin Emperor should've had more of a reaction. Then she dies and her son, a Prince is sent off to west bubble fuq. Again the Goblin Emperor does nothing. A man with no male heir. He didn't even send a tutor. Maia the fourth son of the Elf Kingdom and the only Prince of the Goblin Kingdom wasn't educated in anything by anyone. He was sent of to rot, when he should've been a pawn his entire life. There were almost no plots at court, no maneuvering.  Just snobs being jerks.<br /><br />It takes forever for there to be any real conflict and even longer for us to find out what happened to his father and brothers. And both things are resolved with relative ease. How does something finally exciting happen, yet it almost instantly becomes boring too.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "We Built These Cities", "text": "Today I'm looking at the City and the City by China Mieville. This is a science fiction book that came out a little over a decade ago. I want to like this author's works mainly because he's a comrade. I first read him a couple of years back when he did that version of the Russian Revolution called October. It was a historical novel that was like Ten Days that Shook the world but was better than Ten Days that Shook the World. Since then, I've read a couple of his books, This Census Taker and Three Moments of an explosion and Neither were particularly memorable.<br /><br /> This book is a New York Times bestseller and one that you go to and it's supposed to be one of his better ones. If you read the blurbs and just try to get a sense of what's that about you really might not know. The basic premise is that there are two cities that exist independently but in the same geographical space. The people who live in those cities are trained from their youth to ignore what's going on right next to him if they get the signals and the cues that it is from one of them the other City. The thing is that it just didn't really work for me. It was about page 74 and I realized that I was getting most of the World building for this aspect that I was going to get as a reader. I just said I don't believe it. Now here's the thing, everything else is good enough that despite me not believing the world building and the central premise I still want to keep reading.<br /><br />There's a murder mystery and that very Central thing plays huge role in it. What it really got me thinking was what this two-city thing really represented. Was it some geographical political commentary, which I think is a reading that is the end of the easiest to do because it seems like it's right there for analysis? There's also the possibility that isn't there a bigger metaphysical thing. I kept asking myself  are these people already dead are they in purgatory I don't know. The problem with that is there are  people that come in from outside and visit the cities. And then they leave again so that might not be the best reading. Overall, I did read it and I enjoyed it, but I just tried really had to not think about that central thing of the setting because the minute I started thinking of the central premise it didn't work so just kind of was that thing if you ignore the man behind the curtain it's okay but like that curtain just really lamp shaded.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "034549752X", "parent_asin": "034549752X", "user_id": "AEP6VSEK3Y5MHGJCG2RGHM2EHCLA", "timestamp": 1611703856834, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Not recommended", "text": "Captured from her father's sacked castle, Arpazia is wed to the warlord Draco and bears his child, Coria. Isolated and maddened, Arpazia abandons her daughter--but as Arpazia ages to cronehood and Coria comes of age, the two are tied together by their competing, opposing roles. Mixing the fairy tale of Snow White with the Greek myth of Persephone and early Christian liturgy, White as Snow is bursting with imagery that sometimes weaves a complex, symbolic tapestry and sometimes tangles upon itself in an excess of influence. White as Snow nails its voice and setting and is often an immersive read, but the confused symbolism and unmotivated characters hold it back from being all that it could be. In all, a disappointment and not recommended. (Terri Windling's introduction, on the other hand, is a joy to read.)<br /><br />What Lee writes best in White as Snow is the voice and setting, a combination which brings the story to life: detailed, haunting, ancient, and utterly convincing, the book is a step back in time and into another, more magical world. And so from the onset, and for its greater part, White as Snow feels like a successful book. It is certainly compelling and immersive, and only gets better when Lee introduces familiar mythic aspects: Snow White and the jealous Queen, Persephone's relationship with the seasonal cycle and the underworld, and the temptation of the deadly sins and the tree of knowledge. But as the book goes on, the convincing setting and voice are not enough: it begins to fall apart.<br /><br />The glut of symbols and myths is ambitious, but overly so: it's an excess of outside influence which doesn't always mesh together. (An example: is the queen's apple the fruit of the tree of knowledge, or a poison, or the gateway to the underworld? Though similar, these symbols are not all one and the same--and it takes more than 300 pages and two characters to unite them.) To compensate, Arpazia and Coria lack motivation, that they are better able to conform to the influences that dictate the courses of their lives. But an unmotivated protagonist rarely makes for a compelling book, and so when the characters are passive figures in the most important events (in particular, Snow White's death) the book collapses in on itself, a victim of too many symbols and not enough of its own plot or characters. I wanted to enjoy White as Snow, and for the most part the writing style and good intentions won me over. But the more I read, the more my doubts grew--and I came away disappointed.

Actually, people lose weight on this diet because they end up cutting calories like crazy, even past what can be considered a sane amount.  Also, there are a lot of psychological factors at play here, especially Dr. Sears's marketing skills, which are excellent.  This is one big infomercial.  I would be concerned about the long term effects of so much protein and the strain placed upon the kidneys in dealing with it.  IMHO, mindset is everything.  If you believe you will feel better, exercise more and lose weight, you will because you believe that you will.  It is not for nothing that bread is known as \"The staff of life\", and a mainstay of the human race from time immemorial.  I wonder how Dr. Sears would explain my weight loss of 15 pounds in less then 4 weeks when we were very poor and subsisting mainly on pasta and canned sauce because it was a lot of food for little money.  Ditto rice.  Throughout all this, I exercised religiously and the weight dropped off.  BTW, his insinuation about the Chinese (and Japanese) having high rates of heart attacks due to high rice consumption is ridiculous.  These two people had extremely low heart disease, body fat and breast cancer etc. for centuries subsisting on a LOT of rice, fish and vegetables.  They now have the same or higher rates of heart disease as Americans because unfortunately they have adopted the American high fat diet.  This has been proven by following Orientals who move to the US and give up their traditional diets.  Their rates of heart disease, breast cancer and diabetes soared.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "fast-moving plot, more thriller than cozy", "text": "A mystery in which the sleuth is a professional geologist--and a woman at that--is certainly unusual.  Lee Mims' first mystery features Cleo Cooper as a geologist who has lined up a lucrative drilling operation on a rural property owned by Gladys Walton.  Much of the story involves two of Gladys's conniving family members (her grown children) who attempt to take advantage of her good luck and Cleo's in having found granite on Gladys's property.  The story is mainly about Cleo and her quest to get through the legal and ethical obligations of drilling for granite.  For the reader, it offers an introduction to the danger and difficulties that such a project entails.  Ms. Mims writes well, and the plot moves along quickly.  The opening episode with the rattlesnake (also depicted on the cover of the book) is gripping, and it offers a hint that there will very likely be more elements of a thriller to come.<br /><br />Despite the positive features mentioned above, I had a rather middling response to this book.  For me, it lies somewhere between a cozy and a thriller, but from the synopsis on the back cover, I had expected a cozy.  There are no endorsements from other authors on the cover, which can offer a hint about the genre, and it took me a while to confirm that this is not a cozy.  There is excessive gore, crude language, and sex throughout, none of which in my opinion adds much at all to the story or characterization.  For readers who may be deciding whether to give this new author a try, I would say that if you like the mysteries of J. A. Jance (and I do like them myself), there's a good chance that you will like this one too.

Kill or be killed establishes itself as a more grounded take on the vigilante genre of comics, but over four issues, I'm not really looking forward to more.<br /><br />The story starts on our main character killing a bunch of gang members, and him flashing back to how he got to this point. Dylan is a professional student with a lot (and I mean a lot) of mental health problems. After attempting to take his own life, he sees a demon (or does he!?) who tells him that unless he takes a life of someone who deserves it every month, he'll die instead. The story then follows his first sloppy kills to when I suppose he eventually gets good.<br /><br />I suppose my basic problem with the series is that it both wants to act as political commentary while also being bleak for the sake of being bleak. Dylan is prone to making standard political commentary about police violence, the drug trade, and social problems, which is fine as far as it goes.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A book about the business of rock 'n roll, not the music", "text": "I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is well researched and extensively detailed. On the other, much of this information is hardly bias-free, being shared with the author by Klein's son, Jody, in the hope that Goodman's biography will change the public perception. (That perception, basically, was that Allen Klein was a talented businessman--as a manager of some of the most important musicians of the 1960s and 1970s--but one who bilked major music artists out of fortunes, while still increasing the percent of earnings the artists themselves were earning. Klein was a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a man--and his story is a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a biography.)<br /><br />Klein is quite a character-- a Jewish boy who spent some of his childhood in an orphanage and much of the rest, passed around experiencing the &#34;school of hard knocks&#34;. He emerged a tough, shrewd guy who learned to be an accountant and wasn't afraid to give unwelcome financial news to clients--even when they were members of the Mafia.  This tough-talking street savvy guy seemed perfect as a business manager for musicians and it's mainly on his relationships as the manager for many legends that this book concentrates. Among them are Bobby Darin, Sam Cooke, The Who, Donovan, Dave Clark, and - of course- per the title, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles (the latter, only after they had stopped performing as a group).<br /><br />If the rock and roll business and its history interests you, you may enjoy Klein's story. For me, there just wasn't enough about the musicians or the music (other than confirming my feeling that I'd like Paul McCartney in person. The other Beatles, urged on by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were on board for Klein as their manager. But McCartney didn't like or trust him--as it turned out, with good reason--and this division was part of what precipitated their breakup, per Goodman).<br /><br />My review is mixed just as my feelings about Klein are mixed. Again, the good thing is that Klein found so many artists who were in terrible financial contracts and extricated them then made their music more profitable for them than before. On the other hand, he took a lot of these new-found profits for himself and, much worse imo, he took the rights to their songs for himself and in most cases they were unable to get them back. In 1970, the Stones fired him, only to discover that he owned many of their songs and records. He did the same to the Beatles and they learned the same thing. He went to prison in 1979 for tax evasion but only served two months.<br /><br />Writing-wise, this is very detailed--sometimes too much so in describing people Klein interacted with--but he never really &#34;came alive&#34; to me in the telling. Perhaps it was because the author--so close to the son--is guarded in how negative to make Klein appear but as a result, it seems kind of flat and doesn't really &#34;ring true&#34;. I didn't see any interviews with McCartney (who didn't trust him--and was right) or Jagger (who hated Klein's guts for ripping them off) and their versions of events might have given this book the passion and emotion it otherwise lacked by, in my opinion, trying to gloss over a bit of what Klein really was and what he did.", "images": [], "asin": "0547896867", "parent_asin": "0547896867", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1434519867000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

Collin is a bold, brash rogue who lacks Faith's devout faith in God. When Collin begins secretly courting Faith's younger sister, Charity, she isn't sure her heart can handle it. After circumstances bring them together a couple of times, Collin begins to realize he has feelings for Faith as well.<br /><br />When America joins World War 1, Collin is sent to battle along with Faith's father Patrick and her brother Sean. Her mother returns to Ireland with the rest of her children to wait out the war. In Ireland, Faith meets Mitch and, thinking that Collin is lost to her forever, lets herself fall in love. When Charity's conniving nature comes between Faith and Mitch, Faith returns to America.<br /><br />I enjoyed this terrific book about family, loyalty and love. Julie Lessman has crafted a delightful story about real people: Christians who are human and struggle with the human desires of passion and anger and hate. Faith is determined to keep herself pure and worthy of a strong God-blessed marriage like her parents have. She struggles against her attraction to Collin, especially when Collin takes advantage of some solitary situations, and Faith must fight her passions.<br /><br />A bit long, the story covers a lot of ground in Boston as well as in Ireland. The tension was such that you really don't know who is going to win Faith's heart until the very end. I liked Faith, I liked Collin. I loved her parents, Marcy and Patrick. I hated Charity and given that the second book in the series is about Charity, I hope she redeems herself.<br /><br />There is preaching as well as multiple scripture references, which are understandable, given the subject matter.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Interesting", "text": "To be frank, this book was an impulsive purchase. I saw it at the bookstore some years ago, and bought it after scanning briefly through it. Of course, like most impulsive book purchases, it wound up sitting on my shelf until last week. Buckley makes a strong showing in this book as a political satirist, however his ability to craft a story has something to be desired. He was able to capture my attention for hours at a time with this book, but the I found myself dragging my feet through the last fifty pages or so: I kept asking myself if something was going to happen of any particular significance. While Buckely himself is a mediocre writer, his jokes and usage of intertextuality makes him interesting to read.<br />The premise of this book is interesting enough, and gives Buckley an excellent jumping-off point to plunge the reader into a hilarious rendition of Alien abductees who finally have their day in the sun. The national issue of UFOs and alien contact is brought to the forefront of US media after a prominant televisoin host, Jack Banion, is abducted twice by a top-secret US Government collective, Majestic 12. It is clear that Buckley did his research; he intertwines this story with many references to various conspiracy theories.<br />Banion, the protagonist, finds himself falling from grace - he is no longer on Washington DC's A-list. Rather, he becomes the champion of UFO wackos, people who come in throngs claiming to have been abducted. While the story line continues upon a predicatble path, the ending had something to be desired. Additionally, for such an excellent premise, Buckley really fails to do anything phenomenal with it.<br />That being said, \"Little Green Men\" is not without its merits. While it was initially difficult to get into, after the first two-dozen pages I found myself smirking and, yes, even laughing aloud to what was said by Buckley. His political commentary falls middle-of-the-road, and while he does dish out a few low-brown sex jokes (probably pandering to the \"People\" magazine crowd), his humor does have some fine points. His continual parodies of government officials as bumbling fools become tiresome (if not already cliche before opening the book itself), but overall a worthy effort.", "images": [], "asin": "0060955570", "parent_asin": "0060955570", "user_id": "AFSXURUPP7MZOAJUJPPQBJBXX45A", "timestamp": 1077761971000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I don't get it...", "text": "Gee, so much hype about this book, how could I not read it? But now that I'm finished, I can't undrstand the hype...<br /><br />The story began well, with enough intrigue to make me wonder what the heck was wrong with this picture. And the language of the story (the writing itself) was very pleasing to follow.  But about half way through, after we discovered what was really happening with Amy, the plot became (in my opinion) implausible and a little silly.  The mystery started off seriously enough but then deviated into a soap opera tale of !megalomaniacal treachery! None of the potential plot lines from first part of the story were developed into anything diabolical ( e.g. the purchase of the gun, Nick's father's strange behavior at the housewarming, Amy's cryptic friendship with Noelle)--most of the mystery was dropped altogether--and then all of a sudden I was forced to accept an unbelievable (& I mean really not believable) turn of events unfitting of the characters thus far developed.  It was not like &#34;Wow! I didn't see THAT coming!!&#34; , it was more like &#34;No way! It wouldn't (or shouldn't) happen like that!!&#34;<br /><br />Another issue for me, that I realized about 3/4 of the way through, was that the main characters, Nick and Amy, were falsely developed. The first part of the story portrayed them, in depth, to be certain personalities, but then those were discarded in exchange for the more wicked traits of the revealed characters. I understand that this was supposed to be the big twist, but the second-part Nick and Amy were never really fleshed out to make them believable.  I felt as if I never had a grasp on Nick's character at all--was he a handsome streetwise literary? A small-minded, small-town dullard? A scheming, twisted match for his sociopathic wife? How was Amy ever beautiful and gracious, if she was only ever calculative and malevolent? And at what point did they become poison for each other? I was never made to understand how their relationship became a &#34;sick, toxic M&ouml;bius strip&#34;:  that would suggest long-standing dysfunction, but that part of their story was not written here.  I felt that, in order to appreciate the grand turn-of-events, I had to blindly accept that Amy, and to an extent, Nick, were, and had always been, evil.<br /><br />I have many other small issues with the plot, and was perplexed by the resignation of the ending, but suffice it to say that a story with great potential for intrigue and complexity veered off to become a typical bland, superficial, best-seller-list mystery (in my opinion).", "images": [], "asin": "B006LSZECO", "parent_asin": "B006LSZECO", "user_id": "AG6XDAZEEV7W5OBEIFHLMTQ7UJGQ", "timestamp": 1368768470000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Concise Look at a Significant Year in American History", "text": "Every four years the course of American history can be changed along with the political landscape being upended, but sometimes those years are not just about politics.  America 1844: Religious Fervor, Westward Expansion, and the Presidential Election that Transformed the Nation by John Bicknell follows the various strands of events that were independent of one another yet influenced each other with long term consequences.<br /><br />In the United States the year of 1844 was already going to be important due to the upcoming Presidential Election, yet the political maneuvering by the President without a party John Tyler would entirely change the upcoming campaign.  Through attempts to put potential rivals on the Supreme Court to kickstarting the issue of the annexation of Texas, Tyler\u2019s actions aided by southern slave-owning politicians upended the Presidential campaign as little-known Tennessean James K. Polk took the Democratic nomination to face off with longstanding Whig stalwart Henry Clay whose self-imposed wounds would help cost him the White House and change American history.  Another politically costly mistake for Clay and the Whigs was cozying up to nativists whose mob violence against Catholics particularly in Philadelphia not only sent the Catholic vote to the Democrats but also future Irish Catholic immigrants to New York and Boston.  A candidate for President that many today did not know ran was the founder of the Church of Latter-Day Saints, Joseph Smith, who to protect his followers ran to bring their constitutional rights to the fore only for an anti-Mormon mob to storm the jail he was housed in and kill him.  The resulting succession crisis led to Brigham Young\u2019s ascension to leadership and later his decision to head to the Great Salt Lake.  Young\u2019s decision was based on the pamphlets written by John C. Fremont explored the uncharted western portions of the North American continent along with numerous emigres journeying from the East to the West for a better more prosperous future.  And yet some Americans believed a better future was not on Earth but in Heaven as they eagerly anticipated the Second Coming based on the teachings of William Miller and his associates, while confused after the passing of Miller\u2019s belief it would occur in the spring of that year the news that Miller had been off by seven months ignited hope throughout the extended Millerite community only for the Great Disappointment of October 22 to bring confusion to their beliefs.  By the end of the year the course of America\u2019s future would be set, the expansion westward would cause war with Mexican and later Civil War that would uproot slavery while allowing the two largest indigenous American founded religions to grow and expand in the Church of Latter-Day Saints and the Seventh-day Adventist church, the largest successor of the Millerite movement.<br /><br />Bicknell covers all the above in almost 260 pages, attempting\u2014for the most part successfully\u2014to give cover the year chronologically through separating themes in each chapter.  The overall history is generally correct and the addition of journeys of western pioneers gives the book more \u201clife\u201d then the sometimes stall retellings of political maneuverings back in the 19th Century.  There are some little nitpick items related to the Millerites' \u201cspring disappointment\u201d, but nothing that is majorly erroneous.<br /><br />America 1844 is a concise look at 366 days in the life of the United States that saw it\u2019s political and religious life changed dramatically with significant influence on the future, not only immediately but long term.", "images": [], "asin": "1613738811", "parent_asin": "1613738811", "user_id": "AFLGBVEMLLK253RZFCAKA224C4GA", "timestamp": 1609346999480, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Interesting, but irritating", "text": "Migs Over North Vietnam provides a rare look at the philosophy, records, and environment of the North Vietnamese airforce.  I do not know of any other source for this type of information, and this makes this book worth reading.  The book makes several interesting claims.  For example, Vietnamese records show that many U.S. plane losses--which the U.S. attributed to SAM's--were actually downed by Mig-launched air-to-air missles.  This significantly lowers the fighter vs. fighter kill ratio claimed by American air forces. He clarifies the mythical Colonel Toon, and introduces us to the real heros of the North Vietnamese airforce.  However, Mr. Boniface goes on to claim that the North Vietnamese Airforce never truely lost control of their airspace and won a strategic victory in the air.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mr. Boniface does not contest the attitude of the North Vietnamese that everything went according to their plan and that they won the air war.  However, using his own figures, one can calculate that 50% of all Vietnamese Mig pilots and 42% of all Vietnamese Migs were lost during the 9-year span covered by the book.  Furthermore, by his own admission, the North Vietnamese airforce was often unable to respond for several months at a time on several different occassions due to severe attrition of its personnel and resources.  I don't think that North Vietnam won the war on the ground or in the air.  I think that North Vietnam won the political and propoganda war.  Mr. Boniface's irritating rhetoric is helping to keep the latter victory alive.", "images": [], "asin": "0811706966", "parent_asin": "0811706966", "user_id": "AH5QSVDBGBPOWQRRJGNFEDSU4WLQ", "timestamp": 1302808245000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Comical It's So Bad", "text": "I borrowed this book/DVD set from the library on a whim, and was leafing through the book when I noticed a some pictures in the Ground Fighting chapter that were straight out an entry-level jiu jitsu class when the instructor says, \"never do this\".  After studying various martial arts for a decade, I couldn't believe that the author was advocating passing a closed guard with one arm inside and the other outside of the opponent's locked legs, not to mention pictures of arm bars with the opponent's thumb pointing in the wrong direction, making the submission largely ineffective.  Then I flipped back through to the standup fighting techniques and began to notice some things that had evaded my first perusal: a ball-of-the-foot roundhouse kick, and the kind of old-school karate blocks look pretty badass in a kata, but will get you beaten to a pulp on the street.  While there are some effective, proven techniques in this book, there are also some maneuvers that could either get you hurt, or, in a best-case scenario, laughed at.<br />Thinking that the DVD could only be better, I gave that a try.  This was pure comedy, showcasing two stickly guys throwing half speed punches with the form of eight-year-old girls.  I can't believe this footage hasn't gone viral yet.  There was little to no editing as they were constantly readjusting the four tumbling mats that they had set up, and were often whispering instructions to one another.  At one point, the sound of a fire truck siren lingered outside of the building until they shut off the microphone and continued in silence.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A little of the good, the bad and the ugly", "text": "In some ways it is 5-star, in others it is 1-star -- thus the 3 stars. I cannot lie. I found this book difficult to read due to the author's style and odd grammar, but I do find it to be a worthwhile book because it says things that NEED to be said and are not said enough.<br /><br />SOME PROS: This book -- as maddening as it was to read -- caused me to look at my own very different life experience in relation to Jesus in a new way that causes me to think it was not so different from Ms. Tower's after all. I also liked the way she put a good emphasis on treating one another with love and how important that is. This book gave me a whole new appreciation for pastors. I never really realized just how much one person in their church could put them through (sorry Ally, but you leaned on them a LOT...!!!). At the same time, I hope that pastors are the main people who read this book -- because it might help them realize how shunning is truly ineffective. I don't blame the pastors for Ally's problems, but she did trust those pastors like they were family and it was not until they learned to treat her with more acceptance and love that they could all really work to pray together in a way that was good for everyone involved. Her story highlights how easily the clergy can be their own worst enemy when they fear a person having problems rather than trusting God.<br /><br />SOME CONS: Poor editing of this book made it sometimes difficult for me to read. It would have been good for the editor to sit with the author and have her clarify the many sentences she wrote that truly made no sense without having to \"figure it out\" before continuing. I found this to be exasperating at times, but I really wanted to hear her story and plowed through. I often felt she was taking me in never-ending circles as she kept reverting back to where she started over and over. That is, she would reach out to the church, but then get involved more with Wicca. I think what bothered me the most was that although she elaborated (probably too much) on her conversations with different pastors and deacons and their wives regarding her spiritual struggle, she made not one allusion that I can remember to having told the Wiccans she was going to church. I wanted to know more about them and she seemed to protect them from exposure while elucidating about details of the rituals perhaps to prove that it was not \"satanic.\"<br /><br />BUT I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HER -- ANOTHER PRO: My mind kept judging her as I read the book, \"How can she do that? Why is she so wishy-washy?\" when she would reach out to the pastors of her church, have an awakening and feel touched by the Lord Jesus, and then go back into doing a full-out Wiccan ritual. I as stunned as I realized how like her I have been in my own life, (only without a relationship with the church and pastors), and how I strayed from true Christianity for 30 years -- following a guru while also calling myself a Christian and blithely thinking and feeling there was nothing at all wrong with that...!!!  Wow wow wow. I was just like her -- only in a different setting!<br /><br />MORE CONS: It bothers me -- a LOT -- that she quoted so very few Bible passages in this book. People should be told that the Lord makes it clear that sorcery and witchcraft are an abomination in His eyes. I also wonder why in the world the pastors did not quote that passage to her (or if they did, why she chose not to mention it). Which leads me to another important point: the very few Bible quotes she gave were not from the real Bible but from paraphrasing \"bibles.\" I realize that most Christians have NO CLUE that the 200-some \"new translations\" of the Bible are NOT the same Bible that Christians have given their lives to preserve for so many centuries. (Please check out YouTube videos with Gail Riplinger, David W. Daniels and others for more information if you don't want to buy their books on the topic. We are talking about the Word of God here. It is IMPORTANT...!!!!)<br /><br />Last but not least, the author makes it TOTALLY clear that she was never a satanist and rarely thought she was doing anything \"bad\" in Wicca. She spends way too much time defending herself and defending Wicca and for me the cliffhanger of the book was to find out whether she would EVER see and admit that Wicca ultimately IS a tool of the devil. (And the answer is, well, yes and no. She kinda sorta admits it without making it too plain -- apparently because she feels it is too offensive to think of it that way?)<br /><br />It was an exhausting book to read, but I am glad I read it. Actually, I have 10 pages to go before completely finishing the book but have already speed-read through to the end. Some books you wish would never end; this book is one I am very glad ended. I wish the author well and I am glad she is sharing her story -- yet I also feels she would or will be able to write a MUCH superior book once she gets her life and head straightened out a while longer (and starts also learning to read the REAL Bible...!)<br /><br />Last but not least, the author does not seem to understand (or admit) that there really ARE a lot of different types of witches -- and probably also a lot of different types of Wiccans. I found her defense of Wicca to be incessant even though she finally let go of it in the end. I can understand now the reviewer who said s/he got the impression that the author may not have really let go all the way yet.<br /><br />I might question the veracity of the author were it not for the fact she has come out with a second book, FROM THE CRAFT TO CHRIST. I purchased both of them at the same time, and have a feeling I am going to enjoy it very much as it includes the stories of eight other former witches who have come to -- or come back to -- serving our Lord Jesus Christ.

Anticipating my own trip to Italy, I appreciate the insight into Italian travel however I couldn't help but be disappointed when reading the description of a lovely caf\u00e9 or hotel without ever being given the name of it.  I would have loved to support these families on my own trip!  Glen's love for Italy jumps off the page at the reader as she goes on in quite lengthy descriptions of things. At this point, her teaching profession becomes apparent to the reader as you feel her being redundant in overemphasizing a lesson or memory that was easily understood and appreciated the first time.  One frustration with this book was the lack of preparedness exhibited by Glen and Al when sight seeing.  How many times did they need to leave their camera in the hotel room and then encounter a photograph worthy moment before learning to always have it with them when traveling through such beautiful country?!<br /><br />Overall, the reader, whether having been to Italy or planning a trip there, will enjoy the Husak's perspective on a culture so different from the United States.  Hopefully those that follow a path to Italy will learn \"la dolce far niente\" or the sweetness of doing nothing as experienced by the Husak's.<br /><br />Author's Website: [...]", "images": [], "asin": "141968289X", "parent_asin": "141968289X", "user_id": "AGP7XCQRYXAYRFHJW4I33BCPL6UQ", "timestamp": 1234367111000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Self-published teenager veiw of nocturnally jumbled perceptions of naughtiness", "text": "I know I promised in my AYA that I was no longer taking the time or effort to work on reviews that I would give less than three stars to; but, being an aficionado of drug-related books, I have to post this review as a warning.<br /><br />This self-published book is a nightmare of teenage nocturnal hormones and a total lack of understanding of the drug culture.  Author Gerald Luc gushes about this 100 page short as \"having a soundtrack\" because he often mentions particular songs in conjunction with particular scenes.  He also had the audacity to add (supposedly truthful) \"descriptions\" of counter-culture cliques such as hippies, punks, and beatniks; an insult to those of us who actually were alive during these cultural revolutions and took place in them.<br /><br />The drugs?  No one shoots up, a couple of pills are popped, and a little MJ smoking is achieved.  There are no trips and one very lame withdrawal described more like a tequila hangover.  If it's true that you should \"write what you know\", this kid strayed far from that advice.  It's true the prose shows some promising future skill at writing, but the author needs to work on the emotional aspect of his flat and careless characterizations.<br /><br />So what is the book about?  A young man wants to write a book, has a great deal of carnal relationships with several girls, spends a weekend in New York where another teenage carnal fantasy is filled by having a hooker show up at his hotel room.  There isn't much to the book except bland rutting and pipe dreams of youth.  Boring.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "2.5 stars from me: I learned from it, but I was also irritated by it and the tone", "text": "The book did motivate me to learn more and reduce waste. However, I think the author is not part of an everyday family with average means and access, and I suspect she doesn't work a typical job in terms of core working hours and flexibility. Yet I think she wrote her book for typical families -- those with average monetary and schedule considerations. I was irked the tone of the book and what I perceived to be the sense that many scenarios families face are clear-cut, black and white choices between right and wrong, good and evil.<br /><br />Much of what she recommends requires you to have lots of spare time and resources. And most of us do not have access to much of what she recommends using/buying. I do realize that if you and your family dive 100% into this process the way she was able to, you will save money, and, therefore, might gather the means to be more flexible and be able to afford this lifestyle. But if you and your family cannot dive in 100%, this process will cost much more in terms of time, energy, resources, and money. I think her family supported her ambition without exception, and that makes the transition to and sustainment of this lifestyle much easier. In reality, though, I suspect that most families will support small aspects--but not most or all--of this lifestyle, so I think many families will wind up leading both lifestyles partway, which is maybe okay to do, but it will take more time, energy, and money to do it. She needs to address that and help the partway families or the families with reluctant members. A more modular approach in the book might have helped a wider cross section of families.<br /><br />She also seems to live in a binary world where a thing is either useful or useless, and it is that one thing to every member of the family unequivocally. What I find to be use/ful/less is subjective, and I'm not the only person living in my household. So her advice about things like decorating is useless and often irritating. Lastly, I can't relate to lots of the recommendations, such as using turkey lacers for toothpicks and getting laser surgery instead of using reading glasses.<br /><br />If the book had approached the transition more incrementally, if it had been framed differently, and if it addressed the typical family in our society, I think I'd recommend it. As is, I think you can learn more from the internet and by reading various facebook groups that support reduction and reuse. I got the book in paper format because I wanted to read it, learn from it, and then share it without the restrictions that kindle-sharing imposes.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A decent enough beach read", "text": "This is a fairly interesting book, given the hoopla surrounding it. People have been comparing this to various books, especially Fifty Shades of Grey, due to the book containing a moderate amount of sex scenes. I need to say straight off that I'm not  a Fifty Shades fan, so when I picked this up I was more expecting to find something new to poke fun at.<br /><br />People picking this up hoping that it will contain as many sex scenes as FSoG will be disappointed. Yes, there is sex in the work, but it's nowhere near as prevalent as some of the professional reviews would have you believe. The book *is* liberally sprinkled with sex or references to it, but it's more of an afterthought than anything else and Hilton could have probably removed or reduced many of these scenes without harming the novel. Doing this probably would have worked out well for Hilton, as the critics were right about one thing. The sex scenes are easily the weakest part of the book. They're not awful, but they just feel a bit superfluous at times. It's not Laurell K Hamilton level, where her characters go &#34;OK! STOP - SEXY TIME&#34; (my apologies to MC Hammer) at ridiculous moments, so the book does have that going for it.<br /><br />The characters are OK enough for the most part, although the majority of them just sort of faded in and out of the book. I don't know that I could really name many of the characters outside of Judith and Rupert, as I forgot about many of them once they'd served their purpose in the book. Judith is relatively interesting, as she's far from a likable person but still has some occasional twinges of regret now and again.<br /><br />Maestra really takes off whenever Hilton starts writing about art and the forged paintings, as this is easily the most entertaining stuff in the book and I can't help but wish that there was more of this as opposed to the sex and murder. I like books that have unlikeable, yet compelling lead characters, but this just wasn't quite a four star read for me. It's certainly entertaining and would make for a good beach read, but I can't help but hope that Hilton manages to work out the kinks in part two of the series otherwise I'm not sure that the Maestra series has enough gusto to make a satisfying trilogy.", "images": [], "asin": "0399184260", "parent_asin": "0399184260", "user_id": "AFAAY32MQYRA56IVSVNSCDLNE62A", "timestamp": 1461821150000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Good Read  3 1/2 stars", "text": "Even though this book is part of the Tony Hill/ Carol Jordan series Val McDermid does an excellent job of making it a stand alone book. You don't  have to read the preceding books before reading it but afterwards you might want to.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book one woman's body is found and another woman has gone missing - are the two crimes connected? The author let me feel I was very clever by letting me think  that I'd figured it but then I would be wrong and this happened more than once. One thing I really liked about the author's writing is that even though terrible things happened the author didn't go overboard with graphic details which to me make some books totally unreadable.<br /><br />She also gives a good background and history for the characters but I also felt sometimes this slowed the book down and could have used a bit of editing.  How many times have we been told that juries expect to see evidence presented like on the tv show CSI. Also I didn't need to hear about budget cuts - it's a murder this evidence should be processed first.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book but I felt I would have liked it better as an audio book. I did listen to the audible sample and liked the narrator - when I read it I didn't feel I had the right British accent in my head.  I didn't figure out who did it but I think readers who read more crime mysteries will have.  This book did make me more interested in the books that preceded it.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Some helpful things, a lot of fluff", "text": "This is a self-help series that might help you or someone you know, but it takes a long time to get to the point.  It would have been better as a book, a short book.<br /><br />What you get are 6 audio CDs and a DVD, plus a writeable \"work disc\" DVD.  The six audio CDs focus on things like taking a deep breath to \"reboot\", changing your perspective by going to higher ground, and (probably most importantly) visualizing your success before you actually undertake whatever you are trying to succeed at.  There are subsections on health, business, and family.  The DVD contains what seems like a long commercial for the series, plus an auditorium speech by the author, covering much of the same ground as the audio CDs.<br /><br />What I found frustrating was that there was a lot of time wasted here.  There's some \"uplifting music\" which goes on too long and is repeated throughout the audio CD series.  Then there are many moments where the author asks you to take 90 seconds to relax, breathe, and visualize something.. followed by 90 seconds of blank space on the CD.  I found myself fast forwarding a lot.<br /><br />The author also likes to name drop a lot, especially Alex Rodriguez whom the author claims to have coached with his outlook.  I'm a big fan of A-Rod (who isn't?) as he's not only been a hugely successful baseball player, but he's a great commentator, successful business guy, seems like a positive and thoughtful person.  I don't doubt that A-Rod sought out anything he thought could help him, anywhere he could get it, but I doubt that much of A-Rod's success is related to this \"90 second rule\" approach.  I will say that A-Rod improved his post-season play during his career, so if Fannin's coaching helped with that, it was time well spent.<br /><br />And one part I found borderline offensive was when the author implied he could beat cancer by thinking positive thoughts.  Now I don't doubt that a positive attitude is helpful to one's health, but if you have skin cancer you need surgery (I've had it myself), you can't expect to just \"will\" it away.  A positive mental attitude only takes you so far, and if it could take you to full health then we'd need only faith healers instead of qualified physicians.<br /><br />So \"90 Second Rule\" goes with the other self-help programs that seem to promise much, and deliver - something, but probably not as much as you'd hoped.  I'd put this about on a par with Tony Robbins, but I don't think much of Tony Robbins (yes I realize that he has fans).  And like TR, the author promotes drinking a lot of water, which is definitely good advice.

While I was looking forward to reading about Catherine of Aragon - books about Henry VIII typically focus on Anne Boleyn and ignore Catherine's motivations - the execution was poor. First, there were significant implausibilities in the portrayal of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Gregory protrays them as rather open minded and solicitous of Islamic practices. Catherine is portrayed as very appreciative of the Muslim legacy of Spain. This is absolutely ridiculous, considering the fact that Ferdinand and Isabella were brutal religious fanatics who sparked the infamous Spanish inquisition. Second, Gregory portrays the relationship between Catherine and Henry VIII's older brother, Prince Arthur as a love affair. I suppose it is possible, but very unlikely in that time period. Gregory's purpose, of course, is the key premise of this book - that Catherine of Aragon lied when she said that her marriage to Arthur was not consummated, which means that her marriage to Henry was unlawful under church law. However, the efforts to make this point are rather forced - the romance between Arthur and Catherine reads like a nauseating dime store romance", "images": [], "asin": "0743272498", "parent_asin": "0743272498", "user_id": "AEVWJ4AZJF2I6WZ3KRAZOYHZIRAA", "timestamp": 1207180209000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": true}

How our atoms slacken and slide out of tune. How they slip past one another, the slightest of friction. How they whisper insurrection. How they articulate in flame what we leave behind.&#34;<br /><br />This book was dark. Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down is about a high school in St. Louis dealing with the ramifications of a school shooting that took 28 students from them, and the impossible task that four students face in creating a yearbook that no one is going to want to read. In the wake of this disaster, the town's grief is only piled upon when the houses of the families who lost a child begin to burn to the ground. It's a &#34;story of grief, community, and family, of the search for understanding and normalcy in the wake of devastating loss, Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down explore profound questions about resiliency, memory, and recovery that brilliantly illuminate the deepest recesses of the human heart.&#34;<br /><br />That last bit makes this book sound very intense, and let me tell you it lives up to every ounce of that. There was no reprieve, no respite from the grief, from the darkness, from the fear and anxiety and tragedy that pervades every page of this book. I would be hard pressed to believe that the author, Anne Valente, had not experienced loss and tragedy of her own. She knows too intimately the feeling of it, the way it colors everything, the atmosphere it creates. She does a superb job of communicating that feeling to the reader, of putting them right in the thick of it, of using words to communicate far more than words seem they could.<br /><br />I was waiting through the whole book for a glimmer of hope; for resolution that I'm sad to say never came. Though the ending was surprising and befitting of the title, I had wished for more closure. I suppose that wishing for that is fitting and adds another layer to the reading experience. And it is just that, an experience. Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down keeps you turning pages.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good, but yet, unsatisfying.", "text": "This contemporary western romantic story had all the elements I love to read about: an alpha male who is sweet and respectful to women, a woman in need, tender moments between family... and even some excitement, tension and suspense to boot. And there were some really good moments in the storyline and an abundance of strong characters.<br /><br />I still found the book to be a bit frustrating and unsatisfying though. In some ways it gave too much and it was overkill. Like Logan, our hero, was way too much of everything. Not only has he inherited a valuable, beautiful ranch but he's also an ex rodeo star, has served in the special forces in Iraq, started his own dot.com company (and became a millionaire off it) AND he had time to go to law school. Wow. To go to law school you first have to get your Bachelor's.... so he's been in school for 4 to 7 years (depending) and still managed to do these other things?<br /><br />Yet none of these roles are ever really defined. He starts to sorta get into the ranching thing... but that is the only thing he doesn't have experience in, ironically. (When he was a kid on the ranch, they didn't use it as a ranch, his family were loggers?) I'm not sure why the author felt the need to make Logan SO MUCH but still sorta nothing. Because he doesn't get to wear any of his hats at all.<br /><br />In comparison, Briana, the heroine, is the opposite. She really has no history, except for her famous father, and no hobbies, besides reading. She's uneducated and has a routine management job, her first, at a casino. She seems to be a wonderful mother but doesn't have a clue in many ways. It's interesting that author made the hero so incredible and experienced and adventurous and made the heroine so boring.<br /><br />Then in other ways the author just didn't give enough in the plot. Like there's a suspense plot introduced that never really pans out. Seems awfully coincidental the way it ends too. And it's not even really closed up completely. I can't really argue this point without giving away spoilers so I'll leave it to the reader! And why the ominous overtone from the Indian grandmother that never pans out? What did the election have to do with anything? Basically the story just left me feeling like it was incomplete.<br /><br />BUT even still I did really enjoy the characters. I loved Logan's inner thoughts- he's all male. I really liked Jim, Briana's boss. The kiddos are pretty cute too. Hey, I even enjoyed reading about Vance, the ex. And the book carries a wholesome, Montana awesomeness that was irresistible. I rated it 3 stars because it kept my attention the whole time and I really enjoyed it.

I know it sounds a bit strange but I enjoyed the simplicity and unpretentiousness of the projects but at the same time I didn't like those same attributes because as a quilter they seemed so basic and something only a beginner would be interested in. Am I likely to make any of the 16 little quilts in the book?  Probably not but then maybe because part of the charm (and challenge) of the projects is that they are small. The cover quilt Little Strippy, for example, is 12 3/8&#34; x 15 1/8&#34; and the finished blocks within it are only 1 1/2&#34;! The biggest quilt Scrap-Box Strip is 26 3/4&#34; x 36 1/4&#34; and is simply a larger version of the cover quilt. Another larger quilt Scrappy Pinwheels is 20&#34; x 26&#34;. Most of the other projects run in the 15&#34; to 18&#34; range but there is one that finishes at 11&#34; square and another 12 1/2&#34; square. There is one runner that measures 6 1/8&#34; x 17 1/2&#34;.<br /><br />Quilt blocks include 4 patches, 9 patches, flying geese (using flipped corners), 2 applique projects (1 with hexagon flowers), pinwheels, modified log cabin, and square in a square.<br /><br />The book is well written and I enjoyed Kathleen's discussion about earlier quilters, fabric storage and fabric variety. Quilting suggestions are given but I found them very simplistic almost primitive style even for these little projects. I didn't read it in the book but the quilting of the projects looks like it may have been by hand. I guess if I were hand quilting these projects (I've done very little hand quilting) then I'd appreciate keeping the quilting simple.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the publisher had used a larger print font.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Passionately Argued Polemic That Neglects the Humanities Somewhat", "text": "Salman Khan&#34;s book has achieved considerable success in its description of the creation of the Khan Academy, giving generations of learners worldwide the opportunity to become responsible for their own learning by accessing a range of videos through YouTube on a variety of subjects - science, math, chemistry, etc. - and using the feedback software created by the author with sponsorship support from luminaries such as Bill Gates and Google.<br /><br />While Khan is to be congratulated on his pioneering efforts, it has to be said that his book does contain certain flaws.  His criticism, of the modern education system is based on assumptions expressed by many radical educational theorists of the past: the system, created in the Victorian era, was designed to produce generations of learners equipped for manual work.  Now it seems outmoded, with learners forced a lot of the time to memorize material that they will almost instantly forget.  Khan is also good at pointing out the shortcomings of the exam system that benefits those with highly developed short-term memories rather than those with genuine enthusiasm for their subjects.  He favors instead a more individualized system: through the internet, with help from mentors, learners can go at their own pace and make their own judgments as to their educational progress.<br /><br />The basic framework of his book is a good one: schools should avoid rigid subject specialization and concentrate instead on whole-person activities designed to foster a learning environment.  Yet Khan's grasp of how this might be achieved in the humanities is often tenuous.  He argues with justification that learners need to be encouraged to want to read the classics, rather than having them forced down their throats during English lessons; but quite how this could be done through online methods is never wholly explained.  Moreover Khan neglects the power of face-to-face contact; however much we may need technology to conduct research in today's world, we need to understand something about the ways in which people think and react paralinguistically.  This can only be achieved through direct interaction.  I am not suggesting that online methods of education using new technologies are not good - I happen to think that they can promote the kind of direct communication often absent in the ordinary classroom.  On the other hand, I think learners and educators still need to collaborate directly so as to refine their methods of working online.  Don't throw the baby out with the bath-water, so to speak.<br /><br />THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE is a passionate work, the product of a highly intelligent mind that has applied itself to a social mission, even though it depends on capitalist investment.  On the other hand, I think that some of its arguments need to be approached from a more transdisciplinary angle, so as to encompass the humanities as well as the sciences.

It was an easy read, but there are elements of the story that didn't flow well, and the characters can be hard to like.  But, I enjoyed the premise, and thus found the entire story enjoyable.<br /><br />Andrea was hard-headed and extremely stubborn.  For the most part this benefited who she was and what she wanted to do.  She's not the princess we usually see in fairy tales.  She has no desire to learn to be a lady and would be considered a tomboy (and that's putting it mildly).  But there were times I really wanted to yell at her.  She has a habit of thinking something was a great idea and going with it.  She doesn't bother to think about the consequences and how her actions might effect others.  I think so many things could have been avoided if she would just stop and ask herself a couple questions before proceeding.  But then we wouldn't have much of a story.<br /><br />The supporting cast of characters was a mix.  John was an interesting character when he was in California.  Stick him in Andrea's world and all of a sudden he became the guy I wished would disappear.  He thought it was all a game and so he never realized what was at stake.  Andrea's father...I disliked immensely.  He was just as stubborn as Andrea and wanted such a different life for her.  Not to mention that he was such a man in so many ways.  I loved Don Julian and his brother Alfonso.  They both brought a lot of life to the story.  I had a feeling there was something more to Don Julian and was glad to discover in the end that I was right.<br /><br />I actually didn't care much for that part were Andrea is in California.  I didn't find in believable that she managed to fit in there so easily and in so little time.  I don't think a princess who leaves in a mid-evil like era could come to modern California, fit in, learn English, etc all in a few months time.  But, it was necessary to the story.  She learns about who her ancestors could have been (they are suppose to have crossed over from our world centuries ago).<br /><br />An interesting story overall.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good, but not McDermid's best work", "text": "I started reading Val McDermid's novels featuring Dr. Tony Hill after watching the British T.V. drama \"Wire in the Blood,\" which was initially based on that series of books. Even though those novels supplied more cruelty and gore than I would've normally liked, I enjoyed them overall because McDermid 1) presented interesting characters under unusual pressures and 2) kept the plot moving.<br /><br />I like her latest, \"A Darker Domain,\" but am not crazy about it, mainly due to the lack of her normal strengths -- interesting characters and narrative drive -- as the book progressed onward to a not-terribly-surprising ending.<br /><br />This is not a Tony Hill novel but a D.I. Karen Pirie one. The present-day story revolves around two cold cases from the 1980s. The first: the disappearance of a striking (and strike-breaking?) miner; the second: a double kidnapping involving the family of a semi-titan of industry. It becomes evident as the novel progresses that the two cases are in fact tied together, and D.I. Pirie, with the help of reporter Bel Richmond, ultimately solves the puzzle.<br /><br />I have read that McDermid grew up in a mining family and thus has some insight to share regarding the sufferings of the mining community in 1980s Britain. But it seems she might be too close to the topic as it sometimes gets her off course plot-wise and pulls her occasionally into political (and polemical) areas that don't suit the book.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say if you like the author's previous works, you'll like this one.

But I checked out the book because Shannon Hale \u2013 and, I suppose, Dean and Nathan Hale, too \u2013 had written it, and I loved (and still love) Shannon Hale. I was charmed by the story and resolved to pick up \u201cCalamity Jack,\u201d the sequel. It\u2019s taken years, but I finally have, and I must say I was underwhelmed. It\u2019s a fun story with some great art, but I wasn\u2019t really into the characters and was only marginally interested in the plot.<br /><br />This graphic novel explains the origins of Jack, Rapunzel\u2019s sidekick, better known to us as the Jack who cut down the beanstalk. Jack\u2019s a good kid \u2013 he thinks. He only wants to help his struggling mother keep her restaurant afloat, but he does it in less than honorable ways \u2013 planning heists, for example, with his fairy friend Prudence. But when he tries to break into a giant\u2019s abode with the help of some magic beans, he ends up fleeing town, meeting up with Rapunzel, and having all the adventures we hear about in \u201cRapunzel\u2019s Revenge.\u201d<br /><br />Now, Jack wants to head home and give his mother the golden eggs he finally got the giant\u2019s goose to lay. However, his old city has been overrun by ant people, and the giant he stole from has seized control. The giant claims he\u2019s the only one who can keep the ant people at bay, but Jack\u2019s gut tells him something funny\u2019s going on, and he\u2019s right. With the help of Rapunzel, Prudence, and a new friend, Frederick Sparksmith the Third, Jack might finally be able to redeem himself.<br /><br />\u201cCalamity Jack\u201d was just as cute as \u201cRapunzel\u2019s Revenge,\u201d but I can\u2019t say I enjoyed it as much.

There are no exotic key signatures to deal with, most have just one sharp with no more than three, and no flatted keys, so the sight-reading isn't all that challenging.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Classic Liberal Review: Proofiness is a bit Proofy.", "text": "This book is politically loaded, so let me jump right out here so you all know where I'm coming from (and that I'm not trying to hoodwink anyone). I am a Classic Liberal or Lockean/Madisonian. So with that in mind I'm not a Republican or Democrat, and like to see people held accountable for their lies (or abuse of information).<br /><br />First, I'd like to say that the book started off quite fun and interesting. Seife is light with the mathematics (a bit of a downer for an engineering student like me), but he still pulls off a relatively decent explanation of numbers, systems of measurements, and the like. The first half is very accessible; it is at worst entertaining, at best, clever. Some other reviewers took issue with the neologisms, I personally didn't mind them, but perhaps being an educated late-20s, I am perhaps the target market for this kind of writing?<br /><br />However, as it got further into the book, Seife started violating some of his own implicit rules (such as: Journalists are unbiased, or should strive to be if possible.).  This made the book incredibly distracting and not particularly fun to read towards the end. Personally I would argue that chapters 7 & 8 got out of hand. For example, in closing out chapter 7 he states,<br /><br />\"The sheer number of errors in our courts make the finality of an execution-of an irreversible mistake-hard to justify. The only way around that hard fact is to pretend it isn't so.\"<br /><br /> Wait a second, I thought Seife was trying to show me how people are abusing numbers to push agendas, right? So why is he saying this? It couldn't be that he is an opponent of capital punishment, could it? I mean, he's the mathematician, and he just educated me on how a pro-capital punishment fellow tried to trick us, so therefore the opposite conclusion (anti-capital punishment) must be correct! Seriously... a \"false dilemma\" (also called \"either-or\" fallacy)? Goodness I don't even hold a bachelor's yet and I can see through that over simplification.<br /><br />Later in chapter 8 he brings up some nonsense about a study that compared a Toyota Prius to Hummers. I do tend to agree that the study was conducted to make the Hummer brand look favorable, so I won't even try to argue against intent. I think most will agree that Hummers probably don't rate very high on the scale of being \"green.\"  However, Seife decided to take a detour anyways through a small evaluative argument right in the middle of chapter 8 without much backing. He states,<br /><br />\"(This was nothing compared to the Hummer H1, which would be on the road for an incredible 34.96 years and 379,000 miles on average.) These are clear Potemkin numbers-there's no way that the typical Hummer H1 would last for nearly 400,000 miles-and they have the effect of inflating the energy efficiency of the Hummers and deflating the energy efficiency of the Prius.\"<br /><br />Now, I don't doubt the goal of the study was to make the Hummer look more \"green\" than it actual was, especially because it was compared to a \"green\" auto icon. However, the statement that there is \"no way that the typical Hummer H1 would last for nearly 400,000 miles\" is completely unfounded. I have found the reverse to be true. I used HMMWVs (aka humvees) in the Marine Corps. The difference between a Hummer H1 and HMMWV is streetability, mostly cosmetic differences. Functionally they are the same vehicle. Many of the HMMWVs we used were mid to late 80s models; the infantry usually got the newer stuff. Our models had in many cases in excess of 500K miles, there were a few dinosaurs lying around in awful shape near the 1 million mark. My point here is that Seife probably had a reasonable conclusion (that Hummers are less \"green\" than Prius). But he was so hasty in getting to his point to show that pundits had abused the data (also likely reasonable and true), that he made some mistakes with the premise along the way. If he had shot down the study just by simply pointing out that the average auto consumer buys a new car once every 3 - 5 years, and given that length of time, likely that no Hummer would ever match the efficiency of a Prius, this would have been reasonable.<br /><br />To summarize, I found the book readable and interesting. I thought it started great and ended horribly. I'm under the impression that Seife leans very Democratic but the writing strikes me as being just left of center. It's worth at least one read, but whether as a permanent addition to your collection or just a library rental I leave to you.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not all that I'd hoped...", "text": "This year we switched to this curriculum, Christian Kids Explore Biology, and I tried again to find a Christian science curriculum that we would like and that would be easy to use.<br /><br />I liked the philosophy of this author and many of the points she draws out in the lessons.  But, unfortunately, after two lessons, I quickly realized that there were lots of holes in the curriculum and it was difficult for my kids to follow auditorily.  There is no student book and the text would be way above their reading level if I were to copy it for them (which isn't legal since the text portion of the book isn't reproducible).  I worked through several lessons and assembled additional materials and supplements so that the curriculum would be what I thought it should be.<br /><br />Here's a quick example.  Instead of clearly saying, &#34;There are two types of cells:  Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic.  Animal and Plant cells are both eukaryotic, but they have some differences.&#34;  The book says on page 8, &#34;Eukaryotic cells have a particular organelle inside called the nucleus...  and on pg. 9, &#34;Some cells do not have a nucleus.  They are called prokaryotic.&#34;  No examples are given of what a prokaryotic cell would be.  Then the assignment asks kids to label an animal cell and a plant cell, before first saying that both of these cells are eukaryotic because they have a nucleus.  That was Lesson 2 in Unit 1.  Honestly, I love the stuffing of this curriculum, but there just isn't enough of it and there are statements that are missing so that me (a non-science lover) can teach it easily.  I was constantly running to the internet so that I could thoroughly explain the lessons to my kids.  I had to clarify that there weren't more than two types of cells.  I also wanted my kids to know the word &#34;mitosis&#34; which wasn't mentioned in the lesson at all.<br /><br />So, where does that leave me?  The reason I had switched because of my concerns about evolution and natural selection and how that teaching permeates secular science curriculum.  I've looked for a curriculum that I like as well as Harcourt Science.  Now I've tried two and have looked at many others.  But Harcourt Science works for my kids and it works for me.  As my oldest daughter said to me today.  Mommy, &#34;I know creation is the truth, but I like this book and how it teaches.&#34;  So, I'm switching back through 6th grade and will find another curriculum to use for 7th grade and beyond...<br /><br />As a side note, make sure you either get a copy of this book with a cd of the reproducible pages or you purchase a download of the reproducibles from the publisher's webpage if you're going to use this curriculum.  This is a horrible book to try and copy from.

This h is snakebit.<br /><br />This plot was filled with one of the biggest collection of nasty, need to die characters as I have ever come across: the lying father of the H, the lying and distant mother of the h, the lying, criminal as well as abusive husband of the h. Surprisingly, the H is not included in the abusive category. Given the wardrobe choices listed above he's a Courvoisier, a dose of Brut, and two sideburns away from belting out \"After the Loving\", but a bad guy he's not.<br /><br />Bottom line, our h and H grew up together, kind of. He was older, but never had a real GF until the h turned 18. He was waiting for her to grow up. Sweet right. Yeah, unfortunately as with most humans, these two had parents. They would have been better off raised by wolves frankly. The h's father commits suicide, and suddenly the H is nowhere to be found. After a year or so, the h flops into a relationship with a dweeb then marriage. Another unfortunate incident, the fiancee with mommy issues that the h is thinking of kicking to the curb has an accident four days before the wedding and is paralyzed so she HAS to marry him.<br /><br />A few years later, the H arrives and wants her to see his father who was always like an uncle to her. Hubby's not happy. Before she leaves for the islands, she finds out he was having an affair as late as the week of their wedding, and she's the one who gets slapped. The H brings along his piece of the week who happily tells the h she's pregnant. She's not.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />At the island, the H's father tells her that HE told HER father that she was his daughter. I'll wait while you ponder that one out.....Hmm, I wonder if that confession had anything to do with the h's father blowing his brains out. The h's mom was there and denied it all to the h's father, but apparently he didn't believe it as the other two had had a sexual relationship before. The h then figures out that the H, the love of her life, must think they were half-siblings, and that was why he broke it off. It doesn't explain the still handsy way he is with her. Nothing too much, but still a big ick if he thinks she's such forbidden fruit. She leaves soon for England.<br /><br />Back home in rainy England she finds out more. The H's dad dies and wants to leave her half his fortune. Guilt money. A visit to the attorney to deny it (she has somewhat of martyr complex) she finds out that her husband had a child with the woman he was with which explains why he never received any insurance money from the accident. She also finds out that her mother was the one who lied to the H and said they were half-siblings out of spite and social snobbery. I love it when these British novels play the social class card.<br /><br />It all winds up nicely as, unfortunately, the mother is forgiven and the horrible husband is paid off. Suffer, suffer, suffer.<br /><br />The romance was secondary to the whole machinations of all the other evil ones here. Anne must have been in a cranky mood the week she wrote this. A few tweaks and Frankenstein would have a run for its money.", "images": [], "asin": "B000PCB390", "parent_asin": "B000PCB390", "user_id": "AGV2YOLD4L2ZE4XWOUOJYSZ7ILLQ", "timestamp": 1541778239573, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "This is pretty bad. I am baffled by all these five-star reviews.", "text": "This novelization starts out pretty strong. We see the old King Hamlet, brooding, drinking, lamenting the politics and decadence of his court, compared to the Viking virtues of war and conquest... this is good stuff, a well-written unpacking of many things Shakespeare's play merely touched upon. Kind of like high-class &#34;fan fiction&#34;, bringing a certain historicity and context to a well-known, and much-beloved story.<br /><br />Then it quickly goes off the rails. The author's most egregious fault lies in altering the perfectly-balanced characters (or maybe perfectly-unbalanced) borne of Shakespeare's genius. Their motivations, actions, background, and histories are changed. With the possible exception of the old King Hamlet, every character in the novel (especially the Prince)  is made dumber, blander, mushier, and worse than their counterparts in the play. The balance of the plot and players is thrown out the window, and every character is reduced to essentially the same personality: selfish, conniving, full of ennui. They are all the same, just placed in different roles and circumstances. It's like reading genre-fiction for adolescents. Where Shakespeare's Elsinore was a dazzling and bewildering tapestry of madness, lies, and moral complexity, this version of Elsinore is just a sticky, icky, soap-opera.<br /><br />The author makes the bumbling and embarrassing mistake of trying (repeatedly) to build tension and suspense surrounding perhaps the best-known and most widely-studied plot developments in the history of ever. It's kind of like reading a rendition of Humpty-Dumpty trying to build complacency and then fear in the reader about whether Humpty will be able to maintain his perch on the wall.<br /><br />The clumsy and awkward attempts to &#34;freshen up&#34; perhaps the greatest dramatic plot in all of literature, the dull and shallow homogenization of Shakespeare's bottomless and brilliant characters... these faults are unforgivably compounded by the smarmy and cringe-inducing eye-winks and in-jokes from the author, mostly delivered by the newly-invented character of (wait for it)...Yorick, Jr. (I swear I am not making this up). That's right. You know that skull to whom Shakespeare's Hamlet famously addresses his soliloquy on death and mortality? Well, in this novelization, said skull is given not only a lurid and melodramatic back-story, but also a living son, who follows Hamlet around making wisecracks and dirty jokes, and quoting famous lines from the play, complete with &#34;Hmm, where have I heard that before?&#34; type responses from the Prince, just in case you weren't perceptive enough to catch the joke without a laugh-track. If you ever thought Shakespeare's Hamlet was really missing a foul-mouthed, comical sort of Yoda/Mr Miyagi character to explain everything, this might be just the &#34;Hamlet&#34; you're looking for.", "images": [], "asin": "B00IRH401S", "parent_asin": "B00IRH401S", "user_id": "AHHL4VCKCJ56DBZWM2IFGM2QFUHA", "timestamp": 1401490641000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Quick and interesting, but lackluster citations", "text": "About: Marketing guru Lindstrom explains why we buy what we do. The main focus in on neuromarketing, which is how marketing, products, logos, scents etc, affect our brains unconsciously. Conducting a big study of 2,081 participants in 5 countries, Lindstrom got to see brain scans of folks as they viewed and thought about different brands, products and companies. A major takeaway is that frequently, what people say is not what they do. Lindstrom also covers the \"mirror neuron\" that helps explain why we want to emulate others. He also makes the argument that brands can be like a religion (the twisting of Oreos as ritual, for example).<br /><br />Interesting Things I Learned:<br /><br />  * NASCAR fans are very brand loyal<br /><br />  * Sex doesn't always sell<br /><br />  * About 90% of buying behavior is unconscious<br /><br />  * Aromas and sounds are very effective at persuading customers unconsciously<br /><br />  * Product placement only works if it makes sense in the program, i.e. Reese's Pieces luring E.T. out of the woods, or only AT&T users being able to text American Idol votes.<br /><br />  * Coke is featured on American Idol 60% of the time<br /><br />  * Warnings on cigarette packs have no effect<br /><br />  * 8 out of 10 new products fail within 3 months<br /><br />Pros: Interesting, quick read<br /><br />Cons: He seems to have a big ego in that there's plenty of \"look what I did, designed, was involved with\" stuff in the book.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Like its title, brilliant flashes over soggy stretches", "text": "The title comes from the \"green flash\" which Stone, stoned, glimpsed from a Mexican beach. Much of the insight here resembles the recollectons one might expect from a friend of Ken Kesey, an acquaintance of Tim Leary, and one who hung out with the scions of the counterculture in New York City, New Orleans, California north and south, London, Mexico, and Vietnam. That is, pages at a time become illuminated with wisdom-- before sinking again into a miasma of mundane names, places, and events filtered muddily or waveringly through uninspired, if competent, prose. I have only read two novels by Stone, \"A Flag for Sunrise,\" and the disappointing \"Damascus Gate.\" Like the latter book, \"Prime Green\" stumbles when it could have soared on a promising premise.<br /><br />The opening chapter rambles on about his stint in the Navy; polar-driven wind and the feel of being at the bridge gain evocative detail, but then the narrative wanders off into recollections of an Australian swimmer he fancied, a bit of action he glimpsed during the Suez crisis, and exchanging Playboys with a Soviet crew. All three anecdotes fizzle. They almost follow randomly, such is the nature of this compilation of memories. Perhaps this casual style conceals careful craft. But, from a writer of Stone's level, that is, of critical acclaim more than another hack bestselling scribe, the offhanded attitude towards such potentially valuable incidents became disappoining. They are treated so offhandedly you wonder why he troubled to bring them up. Much of this book follows suit. It reminds me of a few all-nighters, if you could tape them, with a great storyteller; the difference is, you tend to edit mentally what you were bored or confused by, and highlight the stories which enraptured you, to replay again in your memory. I'd return to this book in the same manner.<br /><br />For instance, the Bowery and its sudden replacement of white old bums with tough young blacks released from prison circa 1960 sets up a treatise on this sociological phenomenon. But, suddenly, Stone in the next paragraph sidles off into how he wrote copy for a furniture firm. Admittedly, he excels at his harrowing yet hilarious description of writing for the right-wing populist NY Daily News, which like certain media today manages to arouse the contempt of the working class for the system that supposedly favors those less qualified, yet deflects any blame from capitalism or the rich themselves for this inequality and this cynical game of having the victims turn on one another.<br /><br />His send-up of another bottom-feeding journalistic stint at what he calls the National Thunder, a sort of Weekly World News, is priceless. Anyone who could survive a paper that created headlines like \"Armless Veteran Beaten for Not Saluting Flag\" or a close runner-up, \"Skydiver Devoured By Starving Birds,\" merits some acclaim for such anecdotes. His accounts of being under the knife for a burst vessel in his brain, of interviewing bitter draftees in Vietnam, of watching the moon on the night of the first landing in 1969 from the California hills, all ring true; his narrative leaps to fitful if brief elegance in these sections. On drugs, Stone glimpses time's wheel and struggles to convey his psychedelic revelation. I wonder if any bard from this time can do so?<br /><br />The remainder of the book, once Stone leaves in search of the elusive authenticity that takes him, seemingly with little money and the kindness of many strangers become friends, to Stanford on a fellowship, to London, to Vietnam, and to Mexico in a tumultuous but-- for a while-- rather childlike time despite his wife and two children (who are barely mentioned) to support does create in this reader a sense of how much could be seen and heard and experienced by carefree Americans with not much cash, plenty of drugs, and a sense of adventure that in our day has narrowed and priced out all but the affluent or the heavily guarded! Comparing his coming of age with the later century, the combination of a strong dollar, cheap costs of living, and goodwill manage, nearly, to create a glimpse of utopia. On the other hand, his escape from menacing sailors on a Greyhound bus ride from hell that winds up with him barely getting away from the ironically if improbably named hamlet of Highspire, Pennsylvania marks a gothic tale where Poe meets Genet.<br /><br />If you want a sense of the Sixties, disjointed and disconnected, with wisdom scattered along with a lot of langour, this does re-create a tone appropriate to these times. No history, or even tightly written account, nonetheless for all its faults, I learned from it. The conclusions are the expected sadness at the decade's waste of its promise, and the government infiltration and corporate co-opting of its ideals and its innocence. Not as many knockout punches as I expected, for the book needed editing and substantial tightening. It keeps reeling about, when it should have cut the flab and trimmed up under a drill sargeant of an editor, such as he used to work for in Manhattan in the early 60s.<br /><br />The book bumps into the famous, nods, chats, and shuffles off again, In its slackness, casual air of street cred meets the dinner party, and Hollywood mingling with the Bowery, perhaps Stone, who managed to be in all of the proper places, dreadful or erotic, exotic or hilarious, remains the jester-cynic who sneers at the powers that be but knows if he had his chance on the throne (he gets a quick perch during his Hollywood visit), he'd settle down there comfortably enough. Stone, in a sloppy but occasionally memorable account, emerges rather blowsily, yet endearingly avuncular. He's slightly askew, a fitting if exasperatingly rambling witness and slyly calculating chronicler for a messy decade.", "images": [], "asin": "0060198168", "parent_asin": "0060198168", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1191356823000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The author's heart is in the right place", "text": "The notion of a &quot;spine-tingler&quot; based upon the politicalminutiae surrounding a Presidential election is unusual, to be sure,and presents many possibilities in terms of character, plot, andideological theme.  Richard Warren Field has taken the field ofcontemporary American electoral politics and woven an interesting,though not terribly well-written tale of a third party candidacy thatthrows the historically curious American Electoral College-basedelectoral system into a veritable tizzy.  In presenting thehypothetical eco-leftist candidacy of one Michael Edwards, Field usesthe novel as a pulpit for the presentation of some interestingprogressive ideas, while simultaneously bringing to light some of the(many) flaws within the current electoral system.  If he actually werea novelist instead of an earnest reformer trying to &quot;spread theword&quot; using a literary form that clearly is difficult for him,the book would be more of a success.<br />In developing a&quot;page-turner&quot; about a hypothetical election, Field does hisbest to embellish his plot with suspense, skullduggery, and even onoccasion, sex.  Once the halfway point in the novel is reached, thingsbegin to move along quickly and entertainingly, and indeed, the bookin its final stages is hard to put down.  I also compliment Field forusing the novel as a kind of educational device regarding theElectoral College system and some other strange and often-arcaneaspects of the American approach to Presidential elections.  Finally,some of the ideas his upstart candidate preaches in his campaign arenoble and interesting, particularly those regarding the desirabilityof moving our society in a more ecologically responsible direction.In light of the current threats posed by global warming and (again)soaring energy prices, the need for a renewed commitment to renewableenergy and a less materially gluttonous lifestyle has never been moreapparent.<br />As a novel, however, *The Election* is not entirelysuccessful.  First of all, the characters are oppressively shallow andwooden, and the narration lacks any real litarary nuance ordescriptive depth. The strength of the book is in its messages, notits style of presentation.  Second, in order to make his &quot;thirdparty that catches fire&quot; theme at all plausible, Field needed tocreate a scenario in which the ecofriendly message of Michael Edwardswould suddenly seem significant enough to cause people to abandon the&quot;lesser of two evils&quot; mindset that has kept the vastmajority of voters attached to the two-party system for decades.Americans certainly are supportive overall of environmentalprotection, but from all indications, ecological issues simply are notamong the most significant issues that influence people's votes.  Thatthey could become so is certainly possible, but it would require somekind of threat or crisis (and likely one that includes a body count),and Field does not present any such scenario that would move &quot;theenvironment&quot; to the top of people's electoralagenda....<br />Overall, I salute Mr. Field for his dedication topossible significant change through the electoral system, and Irecommend the book to anyone who has ever fantasized about an electionshocker that would bring an eco-friendly administration into power.The cynic in me finds his scenario insufficiently plausible, butcertainly Field's heart is in the right place.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "For avant-gardist gardening snobs", "text": "Thomas Hobbs is, at least in the persona he presents in this book, an avant-gardist gardening snob.  He sees gardening as a fashion-driven art, where trendy plants are to be discarded as soon as they become too popular with the petit bourgeoisie, for whom his contempt is made clear on almost every page of text. Some of this stuff can't be spoofed, because it's impossible to be more catty than Hobbs here (block quotes preceded by ** and italics presented as ALL CAPS):<br /><br />** Some gardeners will never learn the art of plant assemblage... As I drive by their predictable efforts, I often wonder, \"Is Life Easier?\"<br /><br />** Being a left-handed, Gemini breach-birth ALLOWS me to love tetraploid daylilies. It is WHO I AM BOTANICALLY.<br /><br />** Bowling balls are appropriate in Marcia Donahue's garden/gallery in Berkeley, California, because SHE DID IT FIRST.<br /><br />Hobbs is obsessed with rejection of the common and the cliched, but most of his featured gardens also look alike, in part because they're almost all small shaded urban gardens in the coastal Northwest, but more notably because they eschew flowers in favor of foliage plants - mostly bright or spiky - with color from kitschy cast-offs and outr\u00e9 sculpture, including flesh-colored ceramic penises.<br /><br />In my (hardly original) opinion, a big problem with most people's enjoyment of the arts today is that the field has already done what is pretty or handsome, and since its current practitioners are jaded by their predecessors' work and aspire to being original, they must often produce what most nonspecialists consider ugly. This is notably a problem with architecture and oil painting (and classical music) by about World War I, and haute couture since the Kennedy Administration. So far horticulture has largely escaped the curse of avant-gardist ugliness, but not in this book. I wondered whether it was fair to Hobbs to say he has passed a step beyond \"Shocking Beauty\" to where much of this book is ugly, but then I came to his penultimate page of prose:<br /><br />** I have noticed a switch in gardening, from \"pretty\" to what I call \"the New Ugly.\" I find this fascinating and very, very attractive. In gardening, UGLY HAS BEEN REDEFINED by brilliant plantsmen and -women who get absolutely no thrill from trying to make a pretty picture. By increasing the dosage of all that is weird and unexpected, these thrillseekers are creating powerful, unforgettable experiences.<br /><br />Umh, NO IT HASN'T! If we wanted \"powerful, unforgettable experiences\" of ugliness, we would just move into a junkyard next to an oil refinery! That said, if the book's title or dust-jacket reflected this decadent philosophy, I could rate it 4 stars [...]<br /><br />Perhaps oddly, Hobbs' Vancouver garden is larger, far more colorful and floriferous, and far more beautiful, than the preceding gardens. Hobbs doesn't fail to add a campy dramatic element, however, to his discovery of the Vancouver house:<br /><br />** I will never forget ringing the doorbell, expecting \"Max,\" [from Sunset Boulevard] or at least Harvey Korman dressed as \"Max,\" to open the door. Instead, a very short Alfred Hitchcock type greeted us, with a badly-wigged woman peering over his shoulder.<br /><br />As you might have guessed, the text of this book is more about Hobbs' persona than about gardening. But it isn't until the very last page of prose that we learn exactly how, for Hobbs, the garden is therapy - about talking to plants, which most people can't do (\"and it shows\"!) - and about remembering gardeners who gave him plants and then died of AIDS. Life is a veil of tears, so maybe we should cut him some slack, even if we are not in love with ugliness.", "images": [], "asin": "0881926469", "parent_asin": "0881926469", "user_id": "AHFSWVRFTJGNDGJ6CAHPRL3XUW4Q", "timestamp": 1137287852000, "helpful_vote": 52, "verified_purchase": false}

And Cain pulls a lot of the standard ones out of the box for this story. However, while I found the serial killer plot line rather weak, I also got the feeling that Cain was simply using it to gradually build up the story of Gretchen and Archie, which is by far the most interesting aspect of the book. Gretchen is a sufficiently creepy and perceptive psychopath, made even creepier by the fact that she is a very pretty woman who seems more suited to beauty pageants than ruthlessly torturing and murdering people.<br /><br />Basically, Cain takes a different approach to a well-worn story: instead of a crack detective furiously hunting down his arch-serial-killer-nemesis, you have the repercussions of the end of that hunt \u2014 a broken detective, a world still filled with other evils, and a crazy killer who seems to have the ability to keep pulling stings even after she\u2019s been caught. She frames the classic cop-killer relationship from an interesting and fresh (and creepy) perspective.<br /><br />Despite the overall weakness of the crazy teacher plot, I get where Cain is coming from, and I appreciate her attempt to try something different. I think she just needs to work on the depth of the \u201ckiller of the week\u201d plots while building up the beautifully frightening interactions between Gretchen and Archie. In other words, she needs to concentrate on making sure all her plots and sub-plots are the same quality.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "A Bit Too Much Like a Blog", "text": "In 2008 journalist Natalie McNeal decided to try and get control of her debt and her financial life. McNeal set up a blog to chronicle her journey. This book is the product of that blog. The book is essentially a compendium of blog posts. In terms of content, the book is fairly similar to other books in this genre. The content likely will not surprise most readers; McNeal learns to make do with the clothes in her closet and cook meals at home. Potential lay-offs at the paper where McNeal works provides a somewhat interesting twist, and she must decide whether to take a buy-out, or keep her current job. As a newspaper journalist the threat of cuts is always looming.<br /><br />McNeal is a good writer, and she has an accessible, conversational style. I'm not convinced, though, that blogs translate well to books. There's not much in the book that goes above and beyond the blog.

Villages are afraid or unwilling to help the pregnant girl, a child herself, so the missionary ladies step in. The baby is born, the new mother dies, and the missionary ladies are led away to be charged with murder.<br /><br />At this point, I expected to love this book.<br /><br />The missionaries are Eva, our narrator; her sister Lizzie and an older woman called Millicent. The mission to Kashgar is really Millicent's project, for reasons of her own that aren't necessarily Gospel-based. Lizzie just wants to take photos and be with Millicent, and Eva wants to look after Lizzie. Since missionary work doesn't appeal to Eva, she's faking that bit. Her goals for the trip have more to do with her newfangled bicycle, and the journal she's keeping in hopes of publishing a guide for tourists traveling on these exciting new machines.<br /><br />Juxtaposed with events in Kashgar is the story of Frieda, a young woman in present day who has struggled to make her own life the opposite of her commune-dwelling, free-spirited mother's. Instead, Frieda finds herself somewhat tangled between her married lover and a new friendship with an illegal immigrant who's begun camping on her doorstep.<br /><br />I disliked Frieda, and thought her sections of the book were predictable and only served to break up the more interesting goings on in Kashgar. After dragging out Eva's naivete for most of the book, the ending rushed by in a blur, leaving the reader to piece together events from a few lines in quoted letters.

Probably from a comic book ad. My circle of friends did the same and we traded stamps and looked for places as far away as the imagination can travel. I religiously returned the Jamestown Stamp companies 'on consignment' mail that I didn't choose - kids love mail, they may or not completely understand the implications. My cousin didn't. He had a stellar collection. We thought he was rich. I mean he was loaded with stamps and needed the really big GALACTIC (or something) stamp collection mounting book that I could only wish I could afford with bottle return change. My younger cousin apparently failed to notice the fine print \"SEND CASH. RETURN STAMPS YOU DON'T BUY CAUSE WE'RE GONNA SUE YOU FOR THEIV'IN IF YOU DON'T\". This minor detail was beyond my younger cousin's comprehension, so he kept everything Jamestown sent him ... and they sent him a lot until one day ma gets a call that she owes like a billion $ for her son's delinquency. We were consigned to a significant increase in supervision until we were all band.<br /><br />I learned more history and geography from those years than the rest of my life. Bosnia-Herzegovina? I could spell it and knew it on the map. That lesson in philately fueled my future life to in fact visit and seek to visit those lost countries.<br /><br />The book has two kinds of lost countries. Some had affordable and plentiful over-stamped origins from WW1 & 2. I had those. Some here are serious money stamp collecting from historical and Realpolitik moments that were new to me with stamps absolutely out of price range.<br /><br />The British Guiana 1c Magenta (More Than $10M), Baden 9 Kreuzer (Approximately $1.1M) we knew those ... we were constantly on alert for them.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a fast read and not very detailed.

The Browns life is more complicated than most, following the recent loss of an infant child.<br /><br />Amy's burgeoning relationship with the Browns and their daughter forms the center of the events that follow.<br /><br />All of the main characters in this book are significantly flawed.

Much of it is common sense, but there are some pretty good points that not everyone will know. So on that level, I think its good for beginners who have no experience with web development or even how to run a business.<br /><br />What concerned me was that because the author is not actually in the field of web development, he seems to just \"improvise\" some info. This book contains some incorrect information and there are some issues with the author's own websites.<br />-The author's websites should be models of well designed e-commerce sites. They are \"fine\" and functional, but there are some design and usability issues. forcopywritersonly.com does not look professionally designed, has some basic usability issues such as lack of breadcrumbs, nav states not staying on at the tertiary level, an inconsistent use of text links and button links, blog missing most common blog functionality, use of the word \"click here\" which is seen as a big faux pas in the industry, etc. I just showed my girlfriend forgraphicdesignersonly.com (his second site), and told her the guy on the homepage says he is a graphic designer. Her response was, \"Are you f-ing kidding me?\" It doesnt look professional at all despite the author saying he is a \"Registered Graphic Designer\" (NEVER heard of such a thing).<br />-He defines terms he says are common in the industry that just arent. \"Beta site\" is a not a demo site used by designers, it is a site used for web applications before they are done. I have never heard a designer use that term. We might call them staging sites or testing sites. We don't use the term \"masthead\". The author must be thinking of magazines. We call them headers or banners. On page 105, he says, \"This is tricky because most internet web browsers, like Foxfire..\" The author must be thinking of Firefox. Typo perhaps, but at the level this book is written, one assumes the readers havent heard of these different web browsers.<br />-He mentions applications or services that are not common or forgets some common ones. For example, he says Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression are \"used by most professional designers\". Dreamweaver, yes. The second I have never seen used ever (and I have worked lots of places). When he mentions email marketing software, he forgets the number one most popular, MagnetMail (and yes, it was big at time of publication too).<br />-When talking about web development, he only talks about web design, the word information architecture never appears and that is a big part of it too.<br />-His lists of websites to consult or applications to use that exist throughout the book are deceptively long. Usually the first couple are commonly used and the next 12 or seem to be just the result of the author doing a web search and entering the results into his book w/o actually knowing anything about them.<br /><br />Anyway, again, I wouldnt completely discount this book because it has some pointers on promoting your business and such, but there have to be other books out there written by professionals in the industry (people who work at reputable web development or PR firms) who really know what they are talking about.", "images": [], "asin": "1592578896", "parent_asin": "1592578896", "user_id": "AEJS6MM4HBJ4ZYHVZML6KTSDB46Q", "timestamp": 1304203420000, "helpful_vote": 82, "verified_purchase": true}

The book's first person narrative left too many 'like's in sentences that whenever I passed over the word (even if it was used in a proper way), it really made me stop and grit my teeth.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem was that I could never get immersed in it.

It just made it very hard to distinguish anything.<br /><br />I do commend certain vignettes the author had taken, deciding to talk about homosexuality in good ways, tackle sex and abortion issues, the fact that college might not be for everyone, and that reality doesn't necessarily have all the magical moments in movies (even though this book certainly picks and chooses which ones it wants to have).  These issues were still done I think relatively immaturely and it tries a bit too much to be Sex and the City but the tween version.<br /><br />All in all, not for me.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Some good observations", "text": "Every now and again, there is something that I read that takes me back to the awkward balancing act that was high school and how much stress it was. The older you get, the memories fade and then you read something and it brings it back. When it was precise, that was the feeling that I got while reading Lindsey Lee Johnson's &#34;The Most Dangerous Place on Earth&#34; in that sense that actions, both careless and thoughtful, can have big repercussions.<br /><br />The story takes place in a well-to-do town in California. It begins with eighth grade and we meet the students who who will make up the cast : Cally, Emma, Ryan, Abigail, Damon, Nick, Dave, Elizabeth and one more. It establishes their social world both in school and on social media. Social media being a point of connection and as a source of stress.<br /><br />Then it goes to high school and their junior year. The group is older and in varying degrees, separated and together. Their lives intersect and diverge as is the way of high school. There is a new teacher, Molly, who becomes interested in her students that functions as a catalyst to observe  and follow their stories over their junior and senior years.<br /><br />As noted, when the story is good, it hits that uncomfortable spot of remembering the social stress of adolescence. The writer also seems to know the terrain of where the story takes place as the details have an authentic vibe. For me, it was cruising to a 4 star until it just started to load up on every single possible pitfall that a young person could fall into. Suicide, car accident, bullying, cheating, pedophile teacher, and so on. It lays it on thick which pushes it into soap opera rather than keen observation. It is still a good read but the pile-on of issues that the group faced seemed just one or two too many and affected the overall reading experience.", "images": [], "asin": "0812997271", "parent_asin": "0812997271", "user_id": "AGSP6LSQK32SQEJO3YVVNACPWMSQ", "timestamp": 1482059470000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Lost and Never Found", "text": "The Dragon Round by Stephen S. Power is a book with a beautiful cover that unfortunately never delivers. The writing and plot meandered so much and ended up tripping over itself. We had one series of confrontations after another with a revenge-stricken Captain in Jeryon that had the strategic foresight of a newborn baby.<br /><br />The Dragon Round is the story of Jeryon, a Captain whose crew abandons him alone in the middle of nowhere to die, committing mutiny. The only thing that drives him is revenge. When he, and the healer that was given a \u2018Captain\u2019s Chance\u2019 somehow manage to stumble upon a nest of dragon\u2019s eggs, he knows he finally has his vehicle for revenge against all those that wronged him.<br /><br />I had a difficult time finishing this story. I almost gave up several times, in fact, it took me around 2 weeks just to finish this book. I hated the writing style. I hated how Jeryon was pretty much an evil guy that was portrayed as a victim. What he did, the people he attacked, those were not the actions of an innocent man wronged. When I first read this I was thinking I would get something akin to The Count of Monte Cristo. Unfortunately, this book cannot even tie the shoes of that masterpiece. For this book to improve, the story needs to flow better. It jumped around so much and the writing style was a confusing mix of changing perspectives and tenses. Furthermore, the way that Jeryon treats the dragon is downright dreadful, and no way to inspire loyalty. I would not recommend this book and hope that prior to releasing some of the flow and character issues can be cleaned up. I am giving this book 2/5 flames for an almost frozen-solid plot with flat characters that never really have a chance to develop.<br /><br />I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "1501133209", "parent_asin": "1501133209", "user_id": "AG5IJUHNFPIJTPTLALKCL465NHRQ", "timestamp": 1471484339000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

It's not a Tintin adventure I'll reach for often, but it's all right.<br /><br />It's 1931. After the events in \"Tintin in the Congo\", Tintin and his dog Snowy have been sent to Chicago to clean things up by way of an investigation into the criminal activity there. Al Capone wants him out of the way, while Capone's rival Bobby Smiles wants Tintin on his side. There's car chases, train chases, and even a scene or two in the Old West. Will Tintin \"clean up\", or will it all end up messier than before?<br /><br />You can tell this was originally serialized, just by the way the action stops, starts and carries on. Lots of cliffhangers if you were reading it in in the newspaper back then. Could have gone anywhere, and that would have been interesting. Trouble is, as a whole story, the plot does seem a bit drawn out and rambling.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Another Subpar Installment", "text": "Here we are yet again, me kicking myself for reading yet another subpar Hannah Swensen mystery... This series has been firmly relegated to library status for me which makes it a little more tolerable since I am only wasting time and not time and money. My complaints have been echoed a million times over by other reviews. There are sloppy continuity errors, the series seems stuck in 80s or 90s, the writing is stilted, the recipes take over the entire book, Hannah's technological skills are on par with an 90 year old instead of a 30 year old, there is no character development and of course, the horrible, no good love triangle. These books are tired. I'll give you that the mystery was better this time, with the last book's loose ends being tied up (who killed the bus driver), albeit quite sloppily and in a way that felt forced, but the never ending love triangle is absurd at this point. It's been two years since Norman proposed and there has been no change.<br /><br />I am a late 20s professional in a conservative profession, and I detest pantyhose and I only wear them when I absolutely have to, which would be precisely NEVER to a social event in the middle of a blistering heat wave!

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Very Dark Comic Thriller That Occasionally Veers into Grand Guignol", "text": "\"Dr. Fischer of Geneva,\"(1980), was, I believe the 25th novel published by widely-known and respected British author Graham Greene in his very long career that spanned most of the 20th century.  It is one of his last published novels, and is a 150 page, novella length, very dark comic thriller.<br /><br />It is narrated by Alfred Jones, child of a knight in the British Foreign Service, who has fallen very far socially and economically from the class into which he was born.  He does, however, have that proficiency in languages so useful to the Foreign Service, and lives and works in Switzerland, as a translator at a firm that produces that characteristic Swiss product, chocolate.  Jones, who lost both his left hand and his parents in the same night's World War II German bombardment of London, has married Anna-Luise, Fischer's beautiful heiress daughter, who is, furthermore, much his junior.  He comes to discover he hates his father-in-law, a powerful multi-millionaire who made his fortune by inventing Dentophil Bouquet, a supposedly more effective toothpaste.  Although, to be sure, the author Greene, who never lost his eye for the telling detail, has Anna-Luise tell Jones that her father doesn't use his own product: he instead uses, she says, \"Something called a Water-Pik.\"Go know that Water-Piks were even available thirty years ago.<br /><br />At any rate, Dr. Fischer is known for his dinner parties, at which he debases and humiliates other rich people, his so-called \"friends,\" whom his daughter calls \"toads.\" His guests apparently are so greedy for the lavish gifts which their host--for whom they do not really care-- will ultimately present them that they will swallow any treatment he dishes out, up to and including possible death.<br /><br />Like most of Greene's prodigious output, this novel was filmed, as an all-star television production. It was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, starred James Mason as Dr. Fischer, Alan Bates as Alfred Jones, Greta Scacchi as Anna-Luise, and Cyril Cusack as Steiner, a companion music lover of Anna-Luise's late mother.<br /><br />Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career, during which he gave us THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and OUR MAN IN HAVANA, among many others. Many, if not most, of his works were made into notable films.<br /><br />The author's books were very well-written, highly literate; much praised by the critics, and enjoyed a wide readership; they were frequently best sellers. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. Greene, who also worked as a screenwriter, always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals. However, if you've never read him before, I wouldn't necessarily recommend starting here. It's black-on-black, occasionally veering into Grand Guignol, to which I must admit I didn't know quite how to respond.  It's also hard to find. Might as well start with something more entertaining, like THE COMEDIANS, or TRAVELS WITH MY AUNT.", "images": [], "asin": "0140185283", "parent_asin": "0140185283", "user_id": "AHWH4MZ2KD5RASDETTSVDK3CYTGA", "timestamp": 1313763758000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

I am not the type of person who reads self-help or business books and the one or two times in my life that I was forced to do so I couldn't see the point of the book nor did I derive anything beneficial. I have been in sales most of my life and at various points have been known as one of the top salesmen in my field. I've often been asked to share what has made me successful so I have taught classes on selling. It seems to me to be an exercise in futility. I wish it was easy to simply tell some one how to be or what to do and that success will follow. It is my belief that human beings are infinitely more complex than what the business & self-help books portray and they do not change easily, if ever. I am sure that there are people who have benefitted from this class of book but I have never met one and I suspect they are rare. People are what they are and even if you get them excited for a short time they soon revert to their norm.<br /><br />As far as this book goes it seems neither better nor worse than other books in its class. It relies on telling stories to show people how they might use different behaviours to achieve more influence. I don't think reading this book is going to enable anyone to make a profound change in their lives, just as the past twenty years worth of self-help and business books haven't seemed to make a bit of difference to anyone I know personally or within society in general. There is an old saying, \"Those who can, do, those who can't, teach\". That's why I don't teach anymore. It's depressing to try and teach something and see that the message sent just isn't ever received because of the fundamental difference in experience, motivation, outlook and thought processes between two different people. I would also offer this thought....the only way you'll change your life or influence others successfully is simply to go try doing it and get better. In other words, there is no magic words/spell/book that is going to change your world. There is only doing, practice, and gaining experience. Save your time and money, skip the book, and go practice influencing others. You'll fail a lot, but then you get better incrementally, and you'll have made progress. It's as unlikely that you'll make progress reading a book as it is unlikely that you'll learn to play the piano by reading a book. People make a lot of money by the lure of a shortcut to be found within the pages of their book but I don't know of any shortcuts to playing a piano or in learning to influence others.

Even the title leaves you thinking something is a bit odd...<br /><br />The very meandering plot revolves around Miles Garth, an ethical consultant, somewhere in his forties, who, one night at a dinner party in Greenwich, gets up between courses, makes his way upstairs to the spare room and locks himself in. Indefinitely. You would probably get up and isolate yourself too if you were at a dinner party with guests such as were at this dinner party. Nevertheless we never find out why he takes this course of action, in fact the reason, whatever it may be, has no bearing at all on how the story unfolds. Almost overnight Miles becomes a cause celebre, with people camping out in the street to catch a glimpse of him, organising a food delivery by basket and rope (he is vegetarian and the owner of the house he refuses to leave only feeds him slim slices of ham slid under the door), and media swarming as media does.<br /><br />Four people, closely and loosely associated with Miles narrate the four chapters - There, But, For, The. Anna met Miles on a bus tour of Europe some 20 years prior; Mark is Miles' boyfriend and had taken Miles with him to the dinner party; May is an elderly lady biding time and hating it in a rest home; and Brooke is a nine year old girl, highly intelligent, lively, bordering on precocious and loving it. There are other people too on the periphery such as the other dinner party guests, Mark's long time boyfriend, May's husband and Brooke's parents as well as Jen, the dinner party hostess.<br /><br />The message or theme of this book? Not entirely sure, but feel it has something to do with No Man Is An Island, or maybe he is, and one state or the other is neither a bad thing or a good thing. Confused?<br /><br />So we play a bit loose with the point of the book but the real pleasure of this book, what stopped me from putting it down and thinking all a bit too odd really, is the writing. It is an absolute joy to read because Ms Smith is a master of words - puns galore (Brooke LOVES puns); witty clever dialogue used in such a way that the character of the speaker is revealed without us really knowing anything about them - the dinner party is fantastic reading (I read it twice); enlightening discussions about the word 'But' for example. Brooke is truly delightful, she would be an impossible child to have in a classroom, but her observations of the adults around her, her passionate interest in her home town of Greenwich as the place that Western time is measured from, (read symbolism for the time passing in the lives of the characters) marks her out as quite the most interesting character in the book.<br /><br />The whole thing is really quite genius, I just loved her use of language, it dances all over and it all contributed to the package of what is quite an unusual book, but all in a good way. Even if I am not quite sure of its raison d'etre.", "images": [], "asin": "0375424091", "parent_asin": "0375424091", "user_id": "AEODGMBI2RFWDPCKQZ2LLWZ75IGQ", "timestamp": 1332038147000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Tessa has been recruited to the FEA (Forces with Extraordinary Abilities) branch of the FBI. She's been training for two years and honing her chameleon-like ability to take on the appearance of anyone she touches. At sixteen she gets her first mission tracking a serial killer.<br /><br />The premise is really strong and the investigation takes a number of cool turns, not the least of which is the whole Variant concept which includes all kinds of abilities from invisibility to mind reading. The Variant idea isn't groundbreaking, nor is Veronica Mars-esque teen investigator, but what made IMPOSTOR work was the mystery/thriller plot which, apart from an uneven start, kept me guessing and engaged until the very end.<br /><br />While the story and concept were solid, there were a couple significant weaknesses. The writing isn't quite as good as I was hoping. It's very melodramatic, and the pacing was rushed. And Tessa as a character was really immature for someone in her situation. She was thoughtless and childish and realistically would never have been given as much control in a HUGE investigation based on her behavior. Which brings me to my second gripe with this book: the romance. It never came close to working for me. Alec, Tessa's slightly older trainer, is her longtime crush. He's got a girlfriend (who is a catty, vicious, witch-but a great guy like Alec is still into her), but he still has cuddling movie dates with Tessa and tons of almost-kissing moments. It made no sense that he would be interested in a girl as immature as Tessa despite their shared love of horror films.<br /><br />Despite the flaws, the strength of the story carried me easily to the very last page of IMPOSTOR.

I was also rooting for the villains, I couldn't help but take that road.<br />The cover of this book deserves FIVE STARS, seriously HOT<br /> I think this is where my disappointment stems from, the cover and the contents of the book didn't jive for me. I would buy the poster and love it forever!!!!!!<br />Honey, the male lead is very sweet for a biker for sure. I found his role as club bartender and the \"club's pulse taker \" to be in keeping with his personality. I found Elle's evolution from piano teacher with extreme anxiety to badass (cough cough) member a plot flaw.  Many plot pitfalls, and curious to try a different romance genre by this author to see if it would suit me better.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Recommended only for beginning writers who can't come up with a topic", "text": "I purchased this text because it was required reading for a creative writing class. After reading several of the chapters, I find myself disappointed with it.  Although Miller and Paolo do provide a useful overview of different styles of nonfiction, as well as references to strong writers within the genre, I was less impressed with their suggestions for a new writer.  The book tends towards the overly flowery, from my point of view, and has some writing prompts that I find ridiculous or overly simplistic.  In a chapter on writing about family, for example, one prompt encourages the writer to \"describe every member of your family in terms of a part of the body ... Look at belly buttons, fingerprints, moles, toe-nails, or tongues\" (23). Another section asks the writer to create an essay around three time periods in the person's life, all written in present tense, before trying to find a connection between them. While I don't doubt that effective essays can be written around the prompts in the book, I did not find them helpful in addressing the different ideas in which I am personally invested.<br /><br />I should note that I am a graduate student and have taken several nonfiction classes, so my expectations for the text are possibly different than those of someone looking for an introduction to creative nonfiction. If you want to write nonfiction but struggle to come up with your own topic, then this book's basic prompts might be helpful to get you started (before you hopefully move on to other texts).  If, however, you already have ideas but want better advice on how to strengthen your actual writing, I do not recommend this work at all.<br /><br />Instead, may I suggest [[ASIN:0393326659 In Fact: The Best of Creative Nonfiction]], edited by Lee Gutkind, which is a wonderful anthology of creative nonfiction?

But 1989 the number was 30% and by 2004 it was 33%.<br /><br />Obviously this % varies widely over time but he made me feel he felt that the 33% was a serious problem today.<br /><br />On page 198 he quotes Ted Gill about punishing the GOP over gay rights. But on page 194 he quotes Jared Polis, 'I think that sexual orientation, like religion or race has --nothing-- to do with ones values and to most people it's not important one way or the other'. Since these two are 1/2 of the Gang of Four in Colorado who Nuked the GOP it's interesting the author says on page 188 - 'Yet the stories of Jared Polis and Tim Gill offer another, more hopeful sign for the effect of money on politics.'<br /><br />But the author is not going to take sides? He is not against using money in politics if he being used to Nuke the GOP??<br /><br />Interesting - I doubt few people who will agree with the quote about religion, race or sexual orientation having nothing to do with ones values let alone their opinions or how they vote. IMHO more people have been killed in the name of a religion than any other reason.<br /><br />Many of the 'facts' he quotes end up being from talking to a handful of rich people who may or may not be telling the truth. If a drug company tried to get a drug approved with 'facts' like these they would never get any drug passed.<br /><br />A few comments on the middle classes problems - many traditional middle class jobs are gone or will be soon (ie - manufacturing, etc). And for a long time people were told go to college and get a degree - any degree.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many first time college students were lied to. You must (IMHO) find a degree that has long term viability as it costs the same to get a nursing education as a English degree, for example. On average the RN will have more opportunities and make more money for the same time and money cost for college. I was the 1st person on my dads side to go to college let alone graduate or get multiple degrees (I also have 2 computer degrees in addition to my pharmacy one). My 1st choice was to be a high school chemistry teacher and coach football. In fact, I probably would have been happy doing that EXCEPT I realized I wanted more money and opportunities. I didn't want to be merely be doing ok and thus changed my mind<br /><br />ALSO - many of the degrees that pay more (and have more opportunities) have fairly high failure rates (my pharmacy class started with 149 and 84 made it including a few dropping back to my class from my wife's plus a handful of transfers from other colleges). In other words only about 50% made it. But that short term pain (and boy was the competition fierce) has resulted in long term financial rewards. Of course, no one can tell the future, but you can look at long term trends (like demographics) and thus make a better decision for your own future.<br /><br />Hardly anyone wants the middle class to go bust - we should be trying to lift all boats as this what our country was built on - everyone with a little luck and hard work (and paying attention) can improve their lot in life.<br /><br />Just remember  -  the decisions you make today will shape the life you will have in the future.<br /><br />I would rate this 3.75 to 4.25 out of 10 stars. This was missed opportunity to really examine the rich and the decline of the middle class.<br /><br />SHORT UPDATE 8/16/14 - I've found that the books by Stanley (Millionaire Next Door, etc) to be more based on provable facts and much more useful in attainting my financial goals. All of the millionaires I know are closer to his presentation of the facts than this book. Anyone can achieve what I've done with hard work coupled with paying attention to what's happening in the world. If you want to be rich in a year -play the lottery. If you want to be 'rich' (at least a net worth of $1 to 2 million) by 50 or so it can be done by nearly anyone.", "images": [], "asin": "0307341453", "parent_asin": "0307341453", "user_id": "AGFI2KQRYSFBUCTGFXOUNZZQT3ZQ", "timestamp": 1381635477000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "More emotional depth to this vampire hunting series with good action hampered by a faltering and incomplete plot + worldbuilding", "text": "Vampire Bablyon is the start of a new vampire hunting series featuring a female stunt expert, Dawn Madison. The story is fast paced and filled with enough gory fight scenes to please the hard core urban fantasy reader but with a surprisingly emotional layer that may appeal to the female reader. It fails to deliver a complete world building construct and this coupled with the tendency to leave more plot threads open than resolved left this reader dissatisfied.<br /><br />Dawn is between stunt jobs when she finds out her father, Frank, is missing. She heads to LA and the PI firm of Limpet & Associates to find him. Assisted by a psycho midget,Kiko Daniels, and a gorgeous Hispanic tech guru, Briesi, Dawn begins to the hunt for Frank.  Dawn learns that there is a complete otherworld filled with psychics, vampires and the VOICE, who runs the show at the PI firm. Dawn must help to find her father; solve the mystery of a re-appearing child star that disappeared 12 years ago but has suddenly reappeared; resolve personal issues with her dead mother; fight vampires; discover who is behind the hiring of a second PI guy; figure out who the VOICE is; and save the world. Sound like a lot for one book? It is.<br /><br />There were two major problems that hindered me from really falling into the story. The world building, while interesting, is frustratingly incomplete. Also incomplete were the conclusion of the many plot threads introduce. In fact, only one was brought to a close. This is likely intentional in order to make a reader invest in the entire trilogy.<br /><br />What kept me reading was that Dawn was an interesting character. She is an acute observer and her descriptions of her world were detailed and rich.  She is conflicted with feelings of anger and remorse over a poor relationship with her father; and her identity and self-esteem issues that arise from being the daughter of a dead Hollywood icon.  In the end, I was intrigued about the next book because Dawn is an appealing narrator. I do want to find her peace and am willing to read at least one more book to find out more about her journey.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "I'm embarrassed to admit I read this", "text": "X-Rated Bloodsuckers is completely forgettable. The 2nd installment of the Felix Gomez series follows the same pattern of good pacing paired with a lack of characterization and complicated plot with a slapdash ending. On the plus side, I read the first book in the series (Nymphos of Rocky Flats) and thus was not expecting much from this book to begin with, so I can't say I was especially disappointed. Fortunately, I borrowed this from a friend rather than pay full price, and recommend you do the same if you absolutely have to read it.<br /><br />The plot begins with Felix getting called to Los Angeles by porn actress Katz Meow to investigate the murder of her friend and fellow adult-film star Roxy Bronze. Conveniently, the Araneum--the secret society of vampire police--also request Felix's involvement in L.A. to investigate and exterminate anyone connected with a vampire-human collusion, which they believe may be connected to porn king Cragnow Vissoom and leader of the Los Angeles nidus (vampires), who was also Roxy's former producer.<br /><br />Shortly upon Felix's arrival, he is tapped by Coyote, a local vampire who claims to be the reason Felix was summoned to L.A. by Katz Meow. Coyote is a comic foil for Felix, a caricature whose car consistently requires pushing in order to start, eats rat chorizos, and has an aggravating habit of speaking every second line in Espa\u00f1ol. Spanish--with the appropriate translation provided in English immediately following each line of foreign dialogue. Foreign words used once or twice in a story are colorful, but this gimmicky use of Spanish throughout the novel serves no purpose other that distracting the reader from the story.<br /><br />Plot turns lead Felix to a human chalice club (a club where humans \"owned\" by vampires willingly serve themselves up as food), to city hall and Councilwoman Venin, a Christian televangelist, a surgeon, a local community humanitarian for whom Felix develops an attraction, and various adult film stars. These multiple suspects mean that no clear-cut evidence exists to leave a trail of bread crumbs for Felix or the reader to solve the mystery. In fact, Felix manages to solve the case through sheer dumb luck when a guilty party confesses his involvement at the end in attempt to save his own life.<br /><br />In addition to the poorly-planned plot, there are several unexplained holes in the logic of the vampire society that exists in the novel:  vampires cast no reflection; their skin is translucent; and their eyes contain a tapetum lucidum--a lens animals possess which reflects like back through  the retina and makes them appear to shine in the dark. Given these extraordinary traits, the author maintains the logic that an entire society of vampires has remained hidden for thousands of years by the use of make-up and sun-block to hide their complexions, contact lenses, and strategically avoiding mirrors! In one scene, Felix conveniently has the waiter seat himself and a date in a different section of the restaurant to avoid a mirror on the wall. There is no rationale is provided to explain the existence of vampire powers to include levitation, paranormal strength, transformation into animals, and immortality. The author has conveniently selected various tropes from the vampire mythology to fuel the story and made no effort to rework them.<br /><br />So, if you like mindless entertainment, vampires, and the kitschy use of sexy titles to attract readers, then X-Rated Bloodsuckers might be the book for you. If you prefer logic-based fantasy worlds where the vampire mythology is somehow explained or rewritten with a new and interesting spin, then X-Rated Bloodsuckers is definitely not your cup of tea.", "images": [], "asin": "0061438871", "parent_asin": "0061438871", "user_id": "AFTAMLARPKGWOFOYCMPUV7WVA62Q", "timestamp": 1256606076000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Why wite this kind of book?", "text": "I am at a loss to understand why this kind of book is ever written.  The only people interested are those who remember Sal Mineo and who enjoyed his work.  If they had any illusions, they certainly won't have now!  The author meticulously lists and dates every film, TV, game show, radio appearance, and personal appearance - all of which can be gained from the IMDB web site.  He also quotes from interviews with contemporaries (mostly deceased) and must have combed through every news clipping and magazine article ever published.  Why?  the end result is a character assassination which will turn off those who admired Sal Mineo.  Other than a warning to young actors to KEEP YOUR FAMILY OUT OF YOUR CAREER! I cannot see the point of this biography.<br /><br />Sal Mineo was an exceptionally handsome and talented actor, with two academy award nominations while still in his teens, who became a teenage idol in his early teens.  Sadly his promising career was unintentionally sabotaged by his mother who was a rank amateur and his typecasting as a juvenile delinquent/angry teenager.  Where he should have been under contract to a major studio and managed by a professional Hollywood manager who knew the ropes and could guide and protect their young star, he was managed by his mother who had no idea how to play with the big boys.  In addition, his freeloading family saw him as a meal ticket with unlimited resources charging everything from a mansion in Mamaronek, to expensive clothes and hotels to him.  His parents had a business which did not make enough to support the lifestyle to which they felt the family of a movie star warranted. His mother accepted any movie role offered and as a result he was type cast as a juvenile delinquent. No matter how much he earned (which really wasn't all that much) he could not make enough to support his family's extravagance.<br /><br />Sadly, not having the guidance of a Hollywood agent and not being under contract to a major studio, he was virtually an outside with no idea how to get back in. When the targeted audience matured and moved on, he was trapped in an image of the 50's that was passe.  A savvy agent would have carefully chosen his roles to move his career from teen idol to mature actor.  Despite his attempts to move on, with roles in films like exodus, he slid to exploitation B pictures, TV movies and game shows, ending with borderline pornography.  In many ways he was also his own worst enemy as he descended into independent production of risque material, drug abuse and an 'in your face' homosexual lifestyle.  The account of his eventual murder does not ring true.  Given the company he kept, the constant lawsuits, the money he owed and disregarded and his general free loading lifestyle, his murder sounds more like a deliberate hit.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as a cautionary tale along the lines of \"Don't put your daughter on the stage Mrs. Worthington\" as required reading for theatrical aspirants.", "images": [], "asin": "0307718689", "parent_asin": "0307718689", "user_id": "AFTG27WYZ3HMTSQPIT33OGBX5YZQ", "timestamp": 1295986086000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "3.5 Stars", "text": "I was hesitant about requesting Saving Everest. Sometimes I look forward to dark stories that can move me emotionally, and sometimes they just end up draining me. In the case of Saving Everest, I did begin to wonder if the depression that Everest was suffering from was too much for my personal \"read for fun\" time. I mean his depression was bad enough to cause him to attempt suicide. But thankfully the story didn't stay here too long.<br /><br />I will say before moving on from that too much that we do see some of the things Everest was struggling with. His father is domineering, unsupportive, and harsh. His mother seems uninvolved or uninterested. He has friends and a girlfriend but I suppose we learn that they're not true friends. And he plays football, but I never really figured out if he hated football, the attention it brought him, or the pressure he felt to perform. So I found myself questioning how things got so bad for him to consider ending his own life. But maybe that was the point of it all? You're not really supposed to understand depression because it isn't always logical.<br /><br />It was a little hard for me to believe that Everest is completely surrounded by people who are so cold and callous. That ranging from close family to supposed friends to random strangers to teachers could all be very cold toward him and the things that he was struggling with. Again, thankfully the book didn't stay stuck in this place for too terribly long. But I did have to question that there weren't more people with softer hearts.<br /><br />Beverly was a breath of fresh air. She breathed life into the book just as much as she breathed life into Everest. I worried that things would be too literal with the title and Beverly single-handedly saving Everest from his depression. It's never a great idea to bank your entire happiness upon another person as that person could be taken from you at any time. And while Beverly does change things for Everest, I don't think the credit is only hers.<br /><br />I was a little confused as to how Nami could be popular enough socially to be student body president when she seemed to be so abrasive to so many people. Of course, I came to really enjoy her character.<br /><br />Saving Everest had moments that felt like continuity errors to me. Some I've already mentioned. Also, Everest complained at one point about the pressure to perform with football and how he'd come to hate people approaching him and praising him based off the game, yet when he turned to singing the same thing happened. He put pressure on himself to be perfect, to perform. And he constantly had more and more people approaching him in response to his music. At the same time, especially toward the end of the book, I felt like there were entire missing pieces of the story. A little more polish would have helped.<br /><br />All of that being said, I read Saving Everest pretty fast. I didn't want to stop. As a matter of fact, I stayed up a little late two nights just to keep reading. It wasn't a perfect read for me. I felt some pieces were missing and others were contradictory. But overall, I loved Everest and Beverly. Saving Everest gets 3.5 Stars. Have you read Saving Everest? What did you think?

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "What a Disappointment", "text": "Ever since I heard Eric Cheng make a presentation at a photography conference six months ago, I've been learning to use my Phantom Vision 2 Plus as a platform for photography. The manufacturer's instruction booklet, its web site and You Tube helped me to learn the mechanics of flying the bird, although the difference between home lock and course lock flying was particularly difficult to learn. But with the exception of a few videos by Russell Brown, I couldn't find much useful about aerial photography technique and nothing about the aesthetics aspects. I anxiously awaited this video and companion book.<br /><br />The video has a broad overview introduction, and sections on maintenance, flight software, flight basics, and last (and least), setting up cinematic and photographic shots. However the videos seem more like an advertisement for the manufacturer than any real attempt to teach.<br /><br />The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used for demonstration purposes are the Phantom 3 and the Inspire so if you've got an earlier model, you'll have to infer from the information provided.<br /><br />The package did not include any instructions for loading the video, other than system requirements which I met. I had a difficult time getting the videos to run on my older computer, but that wasn't a problem, since many of the features of the base software, like \"watch and work\" are not applicable to this video. I finally ended up extracting the zip files to my computer and using Windows Media Player to watch the files in order.<br /><br />Most of the information provided was quite superficial. For example, the chapter on software did not tell you how to download the necessary software, or how to calibrate the compass.<br /><br />Other than gee-whiz videos, the photographic section illustrates six types of shots, like the reveal, the crane and the tilt, but provided no instructions on when the shot would be useful or how to handle the vehicle to get such shots. There was no mention of post-processing UAV images. If you want to learn how to photograph from a UAV be prepared to read lot of other books about straight photography and videography and apply the lessons to UAV photography.<br /><br />I can't resist offering you a couple of tips that should have been in the book: think of the vehicle as a device for putting the camera in a position to take a particular shot, like a really giant tripod; and, the lens correction function in Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw will straighten out the distortion inherent in the on-board camera's wide angle lens.<br /><br />The companion book is scheduled for publication on October 16.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Pure drivel...", "text": "I must admit I'm not much of a romance reader, but I can appreciate a nicely written \"beach read\".  Unfortunately, I found nothing nice about this book.<br />There's no real character development, and much of what is done doesn't paint a very empathetic picture.<br />From the beginning we're supposed to be excited for Gen's big opportunity with the boss-man after just a few short pages.  We know nothing about him except that he's good-looking, wealthy, and a womanizer.  Not much to have you rooting for him / them.<br />We'll skip over the implausibility of Nick taking 2 possible witnesses along on his D.B. Cooper adventure, the hocus-pocus of Annabelle & Lincoln's \"psychic\" powers, and the atrocious attempt to throw in a little \"hillbilly-ese\".  (Honestly, those alone are reason enough to warn future readers to run away.)<br />But, let's delve further into the book (not head first, way too shallow for that...)<br />We have two central characters, Gen and Jack, neither of which is all that likeable.<br />Gen is a sex-starved, superficial, egotistical, condescending, hillbilly whose years of shame over her roots are supposedly overcome in just a few short hours.<br />Jackson / Jack is a hapless, love-struck puppy who puts up with Gen's bad behavior because he's so enamoured with her.  For the life of me I couldn't figure out what he saw in her.  We are to assume a nerd is smart - shouldn't he be smart enough to demand a woman treat him with respect?<br />So, despite her poor opinion of him, Gen is pawing at Jack within mere hours of her stranding.  But before she does, she must smugly assume that she is a master at lovemaking and the poor nerd must be wholly and completely inexperienced.  Because really, who on this Earth would deign to be with a man who isn't fresh off the pages of GQ?  Oh wait, now I remember: intelligent women who care more about being with a good man that treats them well than about being with the prettiest man around.<br />I tried hard to like this book and I tried equally hard to put it down.  But, unfortunately, once I start something I must finish it, so I was stuck with Gen and Jack and Nick and Annabelle and Matt and Lincoln till the bitter end.  Curiously, the only characters I actually identified with were Matt and Lincoln, but they were mere afterthoughts.<br />I understand this was the author's first attempt to move beyond Harlequin-type romances.  Perhaps she was daunted by the empty pages at hand, perhaps she thought the extra pages would allow for multiple sub-plot development, perhaps she got side-tracked with all the various characters with their various gimmicks, perhaps she was struck by Grisham-itis and found she had 5 pages to wrap up a 300 page novel.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Too Much Line Work Is Already Filled In Black When You Get It- Sad", "text": "Fair warning: really detailed pictures like an adult would want but most all the pictures have an extreme excess of black ink already filled in to each picture....in other words- it's supposed to be line work for you to color- but some genius has already filled in huge gaps in each picture with dark black ink which prevents you from in fact making your own color choices; defeating the purpose of why you got the book in the first place. People get intricate coloring books so they can color the line work themselves- here it's been done for you in many spots- in a black so deep that even coloring over it wouldn't help.  They should have left the designs open with just line work.  The publisher made a big mistake filling in so much for you with dark as night black ink thus denying you the chance to pick your own colors.  The more I leaf through this book the more disappointed I become. Like the art but it's really more a picture book than a coloring books because of the way it was printed. Don't be fooled; your ability to color this book in is somewhat limited- and that's being generous.  Could have been a lot better.  Why do publishers feel they have to fill in solid black ink for grown people when even less intricate books use just line work so you can actually color? Meh- im getting out the Flintstone coloring books I bought here and using those. Why? Because at least they are not already colored in for me as this book is.  Wasted opportunity.  In a coloring book the black ink goes on the lines- not inside the picture itself; as this is supposed to be a coloring book not a graphic art book or a comic book where the inker adds shading.  In a coloring book the end user can add all the black pigment he wants in ways he chooses with his own tools- it does not need to be done by the publisher.  The more ink filled in for you the less coloring you get to do. Of course Spawn is a dark comic; but this is not a comic book- it's a version for people to color, which means people would like to make their own hue choices- not have a lot of spaces inked in ahead of time.  If people want to add more black they're  capable of doing that on their own.  If people wanted ink work done for them they'd buy a comic book or art book- not a coloring book.  Just because Spawn is a 'dark character' doesn't mean a coloring book about him has to have dark ink filled in instead of just  on the line work where it belongs. Sometimes his costume itself is portrayed as being quite bright in the books and movies in spite of the situations so him being a dark character is no reason at all to put out a coloring book with so much space already filled in. If there's going to be black ink on the sketches the reader is supposed to color it should be on the line design only as with most coloring books. Just because a character has a dark mood to his likeness doesn't mean a colorist should have to suffer an excess of black fill-in when he can do that for himself and indeed that is what people are paying for when they buy a coloring book- elaborate art that they can choose all the colors for and fill in themselves.  This isn't a comic book so the colorist should be able to create whatever mood they want- but here a lot of each picture is already filled in so you don't have the latitude of most other adult coloring books.  What could the publisher have done and still stayed true to the character?  Reprinted the sketches and inked over just the line work if need be.  Here they got too carried away with the ink- this isn't a comic book- it's not supposed to be; and even in the books there are often bright colors- not every panel/picture is soaked in black.  And if people want huge blocks of black they can do it themselves in a coloring book without the publisher deciding for them.  It's a shame great sketches were treated this way.", "images": [], "asin": "1632157853", "parent_asin": "1632157853", "user_id": "AFEUD6CALAUCYZ6R7ZENC2MOAVGA", "timestamp": 1461192148000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Wildly uneven mystery in a wildly uneven series", "text": "I'm accustomed to mystery writers whose books get steadily better, or steadily slide off in terms of quality, and I'm always delighted to find one who is consistently good. But Conor Fitzgerald doesn't fall into any of these categories. I struggled to finish his debut novel, [[ASIN:1608190544 The Dogs of Rome: A Commissario Alec Blume Novel]], but absolutely loved the second in the series[[ASIN:1608198499 The Fatal Touch: A Commissario Alec Blume Novel]], despite having had to force myself to pick it up. That tale -- which begins with the mysterious demise of an elderly Irishman in a Roman piazza -- was told in part through the eyes of Caterina Mattiola, and so we see Commissario Alec Blume, her boss, through fresh eyes. That shift in viewpoint worked for me, and the book as a whole as a lively, smart and intriguing mystery,  with a complex plot involving art fraud, corruption and bureaucratic nonsense.<br /><br />So I was eager to read the third in the series -- only to find myself plodding through a novel that had all of the faults of the first -- and more -- and few of the redeeming characteristics of the second book. It's a confusing mishmash of plot elements, beginning with the murder of a man whose only crime seems to have been sharing the same name as the new magistrate that Blume has been working with on some cases. Did the Mafia do it? Caterina ends  up taking a back seat in the story, even as she investigates this murder, while Blume is dispatched by some shady Intelligence operatives alongside a German cop on vacation in an antique camper van, in what kind of starts to feel like a comic road caper. Interspersed with all this is a strand of the plot told through the eyes of the adolescent son of a member of one of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates. There's a lot going on here, and Fitzgerald didn't make following the various strands very easy.<br /><br />Most problematic for me, however, was that in this third novel, Blume himself simply comes across as a reckless jerk much of the time. And he's a jerk with no real motivation -- he's behaving irresponsibly and foolishly in both his personal and professional life, and as a reader, I never really understood why. He's on the verge of moving into Caterina's home, but doesn't keep in touch with her -- and we don't really understand why. He does something reckless and dangerous in order to flush out a Mafia boss, deliberately putting someone's life in jeopardy -- and it wasn't clear to me just why he had done so, other than sheer cussedness. Now, being a jerk is fine -- I don't need characters in novels to be wholly admirable folks out to save the world -- but an author needs to make their behavior convincing by paying attention to character development. We know that Blume is tormented by losing his parents at a young age and being stranded on his own in Italy (he's American by birth), but how might that have led to these particular actions?<br /><br />So this was a frustrating book to read, especially after I had really enjoyed its predecessor. I'm back to wondering whether this is a series to be curious about or avoid in future. There's still room for Fitzgerald to do a great job with this series by streamlining his plots and paying more attention to character development, and there's a lot to like here in his mastery of the setting and the issues. But I'm glad I got this one from the publisher via NetGalley.", "images": [], "asin": "1608198456", "parent_asin": "1608198456", "user_id": "AH4PHUQB5OQ4ALDY7RQVLIC67M7A", "timestamp": 1342155924000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Starts off promising, then goes nowhere", "text": "Of all of Marvel's Ultimate books, Ultimate X-Men has always been the one I've liked the least, even when Mark Millar debuted it.  Cry Wolf finds Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Rogue, Iceman, Shadowcat, and Dazzler at the Coney Island fair, and the gang's fun comes to an end rather quickly when the cajun mutant for hire Gambit makes his presence felt and kidnaps Rogue.  The X-Men assemble and track them down, culminating in a predictable series of developments that ends with the team being short a member.  Considering that the Ultimate line is supposed to be new takes on classic stories, almost everything about Cry Wolf is predictable, right to it's ending.  What's even more surprising is that Brian K. Vaughn, a writer who has given us smashing comics like Y: The Last Man, Ex Machina, and Runaways, could come up with something as hokey as this, but then again, he probably didn't have much say in terms of plot development.  Not to mention that longtime fan favorite X-Man Gambit's characterization finds him reduced from an ultra cool character to a second rate player aching to have his backstory revealed.  Veteran X-Men artist Andy Kubert supplies his usual array of solid pencil work, but it's not enough to save Cry Wolf from being pretty mediocre.  All in all, Ultimate X-Men faithfuls will want to check this out, but it's nothing special in the least.", "images": [], "asin": "078511405X", "parent_asin": "078511405X", "user_id": "AHJRJCJMK3XVV4BSPBRAHIYEODWA", "timestamp": 1108608520000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

This novel is not about that. This is about vampires. Sort of.<br /><br />It's more about parasites. Well, let me explain this way. Half the book is facts about parasites that read like those tidbit sections you might see in a Biology textbook or Highlights magazine with the title \"Did You Know?\" The other half is some teenager who's been infected with a parasite that gives him all the benefits of being a vampire and none of the weaknesses (except being horny all the time, which doesn't really figure into the plot and is par for the course for any teenager). He works for a secret underground organization, and has to find all his old girlfriends who have become ghouls because he accidentally gave the parasite to them.  Then he has to find his first girlfriend, the one who gave him the curse (whoops, tripped over the allegory in the doorway. Silly me). Then he does a lot of exploring, and he ends up realizing the kindly secret conspiratorial underground organization who took him in has been hiding information and manipulating him all the time. Didn't see that coming.<br /><br />This book was full of meh. There was too much description, too much trying to create dread. And you can't do that in a YA book that's full of slang and goofy teenagers. And there was a severe lack of vampires for a story about vampires. Lots of parasites, cats, and rats, but no vampires being vampires. And the whole MIBs in an underground war has been done to death, and it's no better here. I found myself looking forward to the educational sections about gross parasites and how they help and hurt nature. It's an adult story dumbed down to a YA level, and leaves you unsatisfied.

He leaves her cold, but not before sweet River pulls out the stops, and they have cataclysmic sex one last time. I need to mention that Tessa Bailey raises the stakes to the third degree in terms of sexy talk. That\u2019s not all. Vaughn rarely calls River by her name. No. No. No. He calls her, \u201cdoll\u201d all the blasted time. Straight out of youse Guys and Dolls.<br /><br />Four years later, Vaughn receives a letter that he has a three year old daughter. He rushes to his old town where doll hardly gives him a hard time. They have sex almost instantly, and while sexy with sexy talk, the sex seems a little painful to me.<br /><br />Vaughn vacillates between wanting to be there and feeling he should leave as he is soooo baaaaadddd, soooo unworthy. Get over it dude. Doll is an adoring heroine, but she's not stupid. They really come across just as what they are: ex-high school sweethearts still in love.<br /><br />Angst ensues, and although Vaughn is a medaled soldier, neither he nor doll's manipulative father feels he measures up or will ever measure up. Vaughn gets a grip, FINALLY, but I stopped caring before then. Poor doll, she's going to have her hands full with this one. Yes, he adores the ground she walks on, but it feels he will always have one foot out the door because he doesn't measure up. He can't connect except sexually, and even he realizes that needs to change.<br /><br />Doll's dad is a piece of work who helped manipulate V out of town for a variety of selfish reasons.<br /><br />Dropped threads as in what happened with the guy that notified him about his child, why did the h's mother not do anything.<br /><br />Fun secondary characters in Duke, Duke's four crazy sisters, the new and angsty owner of the plant, and the plot moppet.

That is, the text of the book stresses how to read and use different letters.  It shows that one letter can make different sounds depending on its placement and combination.  Unfortunately, the ABC format of the book does not at all appeal to our six year old (\"ABC books are for toddlers,\" she stated), nor does it work for our toddler.  Our toddler, for example, doesn't understand why the lion appears on the page for \"Y\" (because the lion is yawning) instead of \"L.\"  It's a bit over her tot head.<br /><br />In sum, I don't think this book really works for any age.

These chapters are further bifurcated into \u201cthen\u201d (before Ida\u2019s murder) and \u201cnow\u201d (after the murder). Independently, the couple is also going through their own past issues and mental health traumas with a lot of people involved around them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found the novel to be a spaghetti mess of characters,  events and mental health issues. There were way too many characters involved with problems of their own, trying to find their place around the murder where it wasn\u2019t necessary. Also it felt like there was little cohesion in the timeline of events and it got too confusing to keep up. The final reveals also seemed unrealistic. Most importantly, the symptoms of some mental disorders are not accurate.<br /><br />To me, the only redeeming quality (hence the 2 stars) was the chapters focused on the suicide watcher up until before the final reveal.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Like you need another review...", "text": "I picked up this book after picking one of his articles \"The Naked Face\" from _The New Yorker_ for my Freshman Comp students to read, which he more or less cannibalized in one of the chapters in this book.  Yup, he plagiarized himself.  You bet I'm going to raise that issue with my students.<br /><br />Secondly, I didn't have a problem with his 'easy peasy' science as with the semi-socialist and contradictory conclusions about the whole 'thin slice' phenomenon.  In the penultimate chapter, he discusses the case of one Abbie Conant, who had to fight a horrendous legal battle to keep her position in an orchestra, all because the evil musicians made 'snap judgments' about her ability to play based on her gender--associating musicality with masculinity.  She got the job by auditioning from behind a screen.  Wonderful.  Yet, in the final chapter, where Gladwell is supposed to bring all of these disparate threads together, he suggests, I'm NOT kidding, that we have criminal defendants stand behind a screen as well, or be entirely removed from the courtroom, so that the judge can sentence them 'blind'.  This is comparing apples to fish.  When hiring a musician, one looks for musical ability.  When sentencing, I submit it's not beyond the purview of the bench to take into account such matters as 'does the defendant appear remorseful?' 'does he or she have future prospects of improvement?' 'does he or she have a history of recidivist behavior?' and other factors (beyond skin color) that weigh into a judge's decision.  Those factors *can* be assessed, as Gladwell himself argues, by 'thin slicing'.  Why is observing how a defendant behaves in the courtroom during the trial NOT acceptable thin slicing, when you ARE judging his character and ability to socially interact?  What he suggests is sentencing that a computer could do via a pretty simple algorithm.  We've TRIED mandatory sentencing and 'three strikes' policies, which attempt to remove race or class bias from the hands of judges (whom we apparently don't trust), and they didn't work.  Gladwell doesn't in the least suggest how his idea is really any different, or how it would be any more successful:  perhaps, if race is the issue, the issue is NOT with the judges but with the cops or district attorneys who decide to arrest or prosecute in the first case?  So, what?  Everyone's supposed to walk around with a bag over their heads so the (racist) cops can't see what color they are?  Crikey!<br /><br />Meanwhile, he doesn't address at all one of the more pressing, though smaller, perhaps, in scale, interests of the average reader: how can *I* use this in my life?  Not just 'buy cars on impulse, but debate about breakfast cereals', but in interpersonal interactions?  That's where most of his anecdotes focussed, but most of his prescriptions were not.  That sort of disconnect between ambitious social reform and interpersonal evidence is always suspect, because it leaves out the intermediate step: the small group.<br /><br />That being said, it's an easy read, and Gladwell is an entertaining stylist.  This is a book I'd recommend for plane trips or beach reading: enough to keep you interested, and intrigued, yet nothing that is going to significantly alter your paradigm.", "images": [], "asin": "0316010669", "parent_asin": "0316010669", "user_id": "AGZXNBVAVWJQPYO6LFGT66FKLBRA", "timestamp": 1185014241000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Excellent period detail swamps the plot & characters", "text": "Perhaps I was one of only a few readers who came to this without having read Ford's previous novel, [[ASIN:0345505344 Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet]]. After reading this subsequent book, however, my temptation is not to bother rushing out to buy that book, but wait to pick it up at the library one week when I don't have anything more appealing clamoring for my attention.<br /><br />That's because this novel left me strangely cold. Many of the basic plot elements -- the young Liu Song battling the odds to survive as a Chinese-American woman and single mother in 1920s and 1930s Seattle -- reminded me a bit too much of some of the family epics by authors like Belva Plain that I read back in the 1980s -- the details varied, of course, but the trials and traumas felt oddly formulaic. Nor did the quest by young William to find the elusive Willow Frost, now a screen star of pre-Hollywood 'talkies', believing her to be his long-vanished mother, feel terribly convincing to me. It was all mildly interesting, but never very persuasive and never as completely engaging as even many less well-written novels are.<br /><br />In contrast, the writing and the evocation of the period -- Seattle, in the transition from boom to Depression, and the very early years of movie-making -- were very appealing. The result was a mixed bag: a novel whose characters never came truly alive for me and who felt more like a collection of sad/tragic experiences than real individuals, but with a backdrop that was deeply interesting. The result was a not-terribly memorable book, alas, at least for this reader.<br /><br />Given the universal praise for Ford's previous work, perhaps this is another example of the \"sophomore slump\": a novelist and/or publisher rushing to capitalize on the runaway success of one book by pushing out a second as quickly as possible, even if it doesn't measure up. Reading this wasn't a traumatic experience, to be sure, but it didn't make me think, wow, what a great discovery, or make me want to hit the \"buy now\" button on any of his other work instantly.", "images": [], "asin": "0345522028", "parent_asin": "0345522028", "user_id": "AH4PHUQB5OQ4ALDY7RQVLIC67M7A", "timestamp": 1384651534000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Clarke is my favorite Science Fiction writer.  He partnered with Gentry Lee on some of the Rama books, (in retrospect) to develop the characters in Rama.  I loved the Rama series.  Since this was a continuation of Rama, I had high hopes.  Some spoilers, so don't read further if you don't want to know.  The book sets a plot of good defeating evil all the way up to the end, and then the bad guy wins, the good guy loses, and the girl dies.  Not just any girl, but a futuristic Nun who helps pretty much the whole world and is the sweetest and most kind person ever.  The hero is ultimately emasculated to wear an alien bra to breast feed the baby of the dead mother (Nun Pun), a baby sired by the evil Muslim rapist father, all while hopelessly trapped on an island inside a space ship, which is itself one giant bad acid trip.  Seriously, WTF?  Science fiction is an existential metaphor that allows us to tell stories about the human condition.  It's supposed to help us imagine other possibilities and a better tomorrow.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good book for history buffs", "text": "I enjoy books which portray time periods not always familiar to most people. Not only that, England has had a turbulent past, despite its recent appearance as a pleasant place to live. Common folks and nobility lived in constant fear for lives and property.<br /><br />This series, while fiction, portrays that life on the edge of disaster during the reign of King Richard I and John in the latter part of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. Armies of knights and their retainers swarmed the land, destroying hapless farms and towns in their wake and engaging in bloody battles. Not to mention external enemies like France and Scotland, or the feuds over sections of the European  continent left over from the Norman invasion of 1066. T'was a tough time to live in for most Englishmen and their families.<br /><br />The Border Knight books, particularly the last three, graphically illustrate the times through the eyes of a a son of a noble family, Thomas of Stockton, knighted on the Crusade battlefield where his father died. After a time in France, he returns home to discover his lands confiscated and virtually destroyed by Prince John, who is filling in while Richard is crusading. The rest of the series revolves around his efforts to win them back and restore his family's reputation. It's a devious and violent path.<br /><br />If you like reading about combat, there's plenty of that.  Thomas is a likable character, though I think he's a Dudley-Do-Right, which makes him hard to believe.

Author Brette Sember proves that is indeed the case, turning out everything from Candied Yams and Chicken Tortilla Pie to Scallop Bites, portioning them out using various sizes of muffin pans.<br /><br />Cooking things other than muffins and cupcakes in muffin tins is nothing particularly new.  Betty Crocker's early 1960's Dinner For Two cookbook featured individual meatloaves baked in muffin tins and baked eggs, with or without a bologna cup underneath, were quite common during the 50's and 60's.  Grandma does have to wonder, though, why on earth one would bother with some of this.<br /><br />The Cocktail Meatballs started life decades ago as a stunningly easy and delicious slow cooker recipe.  This is one Grandma has been making for many years.  A mere dozen meatballs baked in individual muffin cups seems both terribly messy (the meatballs are cooked in a sauce of grape jelly and barbecue sauce) and FAR short of the number required for even a very small party.  Every time Grandma has ever served these or seen them served they are the very first appetizer to disappear - no matter how many you make.  Grandma usually starts with five pounds of ground meat.<br /><br />Chicken Tortilla Pie is just fussy.  One starts by cutting 18 little circles out of 3 large flour tortillas.  A recipe for Tuna Burgers calls for baking them in regular sized muffin cups, to produce a burger that is about 2\" across, which the author then suggests serving on hamburg buns . . . . .  wouldn't that teeny, slider sized \"burger\" in the center of a hamburg bun be cute?<br /><br />Baking individual portions of things in muffin tins is a nice little gimmick to spice up your party nibbles, but there is such a thing as way too much of a good thing, sort of like serving three different fondues at the same one party.  Overkill.<br /><br />The book is entirely printed in red-orange, very hard to read, particularly in the smaller print of the notes and the index, for which Grandma had to drag out reading glasses.<br /><br />There are very few pictures, all of them located in an eight page spread in the center of the book, featuring some of the very worst food photography - or even photography in general - that Grandma has ever seen, with most of the photos so out of focus they are fuzzy.<br /><br />All in all, [[ASIN:1440532168 The Muffin Tin Cookbook: 200 Fast, Delicious Mini-Pies, Pasta Cups, Gourmet Pockets, Veggie Cakes, and More!]] feels gimmicky and not particularly well thought out.<br /><br />Not recommended", "images": [], "asin": "1440532168", "parent_asin": "1440532168", "user_id": "AE4XWDMQ4GPQ2CUMNBZRU47S7EOQ", "timestamp": 1343919333000, "helpful_vote": 40, "verified_purchase": false}

Spider Bones is Reichs' 13th book in her Temperance Brennan series, and I found much of this novel very interesting.<br /><br />Dr. Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who splits her time between Montreal and North Carolina.  While in Canada, a dead man is found in a rural lake.  It turns out that he was playing \"naughty nurse\" and died of \"accidental asphyxia associated with autoerotic activity.\"  But the real shocker comes when his prints are sent for identification, and the authorities learn that they belong to John Lowery.  The problem is that John Lowery died in a chopper crash in Vietnam in 1868 and was buried in his hometown in North Carolina.  Brennan is sent to North Carolina to exhume the remains in Lowery's grave to discover which one is the real John Lowery.<br /><br />The North Carolina remains are transported to Hawaii to JPAC (Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command) and Brennan is sent there as well to assist.  But then a third set of remains is discovered stored at JPAC, which makes the situation even more complicated.  Brennan also gets involved in a local case, which creates danger for her and those around her.<br /><br />I found the information and history about JPAC quite fascinating.  JPAC continuously works to locate missing military personnel from World War II (78,000+ missing), Korea (8,100+ missing), the Cold War (120 missing) and Vietnam (1800+ missing).  \"Core operations involve the pursuit of leads, the recovery of remains and artifacts, and the identification of individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.\" Large teams are needed to help JPAC including historians, analysts, and IT (Investigative Teams) made up of forensic anthropologists, linguists, medics, life support techs, forensic photographers, explosive ordinance disposal techs, divers, mountaineering specialists, etc.  Then more professionals are needed once the remains reach Hawaii.  On average 6 remains are identified each month.<br /><br />But while I found the JPAC information fascinating, I thought the subplot with Brennan's daughter, Katy, and Lily (the daughter of former lover Detective Andrew Ryan) downright stupid.  In fact, I find that Katy doesn't add much to this series. Also, the subplot about the Hawaiian drug dealers and local gangs was confusing and unnecessary. Reichs had enough going on with JPAC.<br /><br />I know that the television series based on this series, Bones, has become a big hit.  Personally, I think the books are so much better.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "An interesting read", "text": "This collection of philosophical views reagarding the differant asspects of war, specifically nuclear war is a very interesting read.  If you remember the 60's and the turmoil of those times then these writings published in 1969 will bring back some of those times.  The essays (18 of them) cover, The War System, The Causes of War as well as other aspects of war.  The different Proffesors of Philosophy all write with an aim to show why war is the way it is, why we fight or why it is unjustified or what must happen to stop further wars.  Some it can easily be seen are biased in one way or another in their views and they let that come through, however this is not true of all the writers.<br /><br />By far the best essay is National Sovereignty and International Anarchy by Paul Arthur Schilpp.  It is a look at the way in which the sovereignty that nations claim is also a source of anarchy internationally because no true enforcable international laws/rules exist to cause nations to interact respectfully and peacefully with each other.  They can and do make and break treaties at will and for any reason.<br /><br />True hard line philosophy people may find this book not to their liking.  However, it is a interesting look and viewpoint regarding war and nuclear war from a time when their was a very serious concern that any day may be the final day before nuclear holocaust.  These times were full of competing view points on war and the Vietnam War was in full swing with protests all over college campuses acroos America.  These respected people were attempting to send out an educated outlook on war and its purpose and use in modern times.  I believe there are some points in these writting worthy of being made required reading for people today.<br /><br />The reason I did not rate it higher than three stars is because there are some writers that used this book to climb onto a soapbox and peach but overall the thoughts in these writing are measured and well thoughtout.", "images": [], "asin": "B000ZT11OU", "parent_asin": "B000ZT11OU", "user_id": "AGB6DTQOCGTR2PR46E7IZDOQTMLA", "timestamp": 1348641478000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good in debunking the myth behind millionaires, but...", "text": "It was interesting to learn that the people with high net worth were not generally those who look that way -- according to the surveys the authors conducted, wealthy people were most often those who didn't appear wealthy. The secret of their high net worth, the authors contend, is that they are PAWs (\"Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth\"), or in other words frugal, those who save or invest a much higher percentage of their income compared to the rate they consume. The authors even go ahead to redefine what it is to be wealthy. Congruent to the results of their study, \"wealthy\" people are exactly those who continue to accumulate no matter what their income, and are not those who currently possess much but do not accumulate. Though simple at first sight, I found their new definition to be useful, and this much I can say that I have gained from the book.<br /><br />However the lesson I mentioned I learnt is just about everything the book offers. There is no so to say royal way to make money other than being frugal, evading tax as much as one can, and allocating as much time and energy to financial planning as possible, the authors claim. Perhaps this is the reason why the second chapters on appear redundant. The car example the authors quote repeatedly throughout the book is typical in this regard. It was indeed interesting to learn that the Ford pickup model was the most popular (and not some conspicuous foreign made high performance car) among the millionaires surveyed, but calculating the cost per pound of a good fraction of the cars currently available in the market? The very first time the authors wrote about \"you aren't what you drive,\" I got the message. It would have been much more educational if the authors instead included a study on the distribution of the industries those millionaires worked in (there is a such list at the end of the book, but no distribution statistics).<br /><br />Speaking of examples, I found some statistical results curious. For instance, in a early chapter of the book where the authors present a study on the ancestry groups of the millionaires surveyed (to ultimately claim that millionaires are mostly self-made) I could not find data for Afro Americans, Hispanics, or Asians. It is plausible that these ethnic groups (representing 28%+ of US population as of 2000) were not included because they did not have high percentage of millionaires per ethnic household and the table presented contained only the top ten in this measure. But recent studies of net worth stratified by ethnicity (for e.g. studies by L. Hao of Johns Hopkins Univ.) indicate Asian immigrants having higher median net worth compared to other US immigrant ethnic groups including Whites. Could it be that the majority of Asians are UAWs (the opposite of PAWs -- \"Under Accumulators of Wealth\")? As for a glaring omission. The authors assert that an overwhelming majority of millionaires they surveyed were self-employed. This much I am able to believe in good faith. But what exactly is the ratio between self-employed and not (for e.g. physicians, lawyers, engineers etc)? Wouldn't this ratio be more meaningful than including the types of credit cards those millionaires hold?<br /><br />The strength of this book compared to others in the same category is in that the authors conducted real field work. Some results were revealing, but as noted earlier, many of them were redundant. It would be interesting to read a volume on the same subject that does not try too hard to appeal to the general public.", "images": [], "asin": "0671015206", "parent_asin": "0671015206", "user_id": "AEIC46UGS2IWFT6MG6QDF4IPUTCQ", "timestamp": 1107249022000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

The actual \"Fiji Mermaid\" was quite different from what she'd expected but unforgettable in its own right.<br /><br />Emile Guillaudeu is a middle-aged taxidermist employed by The American Museum in New York. When his lifelong friend, the museum owner, sold the museum to P. T. Barnum, Emile stayed with the museum but nurses a grudge against both men for the changes wrought in his carefully ordered world.<br /><br />Over eight feet tall, Ana Swift is the world's only professional giantess. On the heels of a crushing disillusionment, she's come to New York to be one of the museum's exotic exhibits. Angry and defensive, Ana is used to being treated as a freak and doesn't quite know how to react when people don't conform to her expectations. Grudgingly grateful for the job, she hates Barnum for putting her on display.<br /><br />The book is a slice of life at the museum, told in a series of vignettes that don't really add up to an overall plot. Each set piece is beautifully told but there's not a lot of impetus to pull you through the story. Encounters occur and go unresolved, much like life. That said, many of the characters (particularly for me Tai Shan, Matthew of the cojoined twins and the beluga whale) are impossible to forget.<br /><br />I have a pet peeve about books with multiple narrators that lack distinct voices. That is absolutely not a problem here. Just a few lines out of context and you'll know which character you're reading.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Stick to the Fundamentals", "text": "The author has written an eclectic rant. I am in branding, marketing and advertising but had not heard of Bob Hoffman until I happened across this book. Right upfront he recognizes that people in the industry are &#34;funny, cynical and immature bastards&#34;. Based on personal and professional feedback I would seem to fit that criteria. As such, I did enjoy the first third of the book but then it grew so sardonic and acidic that it was hard to appreciate the lessons in the messages.<br /><br />Advertising is a funny practice and profession. It is revered and reviled in equal amounts. I appreciate the author's attempt to hold it accountable and I totally agree that it has too long been focused on fancy tricks instead of recognizing the tried and true. Rather than dissect the contents, let me provide a few standout lines that resonated (these are not spoilers):<br /><br />- Hoffman writes that the marketing industry is under mass delusion that includes &#34;the gross exaggeration of the role of brands; the mangling of the role of ad agencies; the mistaking of gimmicks for trends&#34;<br /><br />- &#34;Marketers are taught not to think simply.&#34;<br /><br />- &#34;Advertising has always been 90% lousy, but online advertising has set a new standard for awfulness.&#34;<br /><br />- &#34;most of what we call 'brand loyalty' is simply habit, convenience, mild satisfaction or easy availability.&#34;<br /><br />The book is a series of short essays and blog posts so you can pick and choose topics that interest you. Coherence and consistency are tested but the feisty and testy ad veteran tone reverberates throughout. He sounds too bitter for someone who made his career in the profession.

Previously  married to the daughter of the stake president, he had been working as a historian in the archives of the L. D. S. church.  \"Took me three years to realize I was there to find and catalogue, nothing else.  I find it.  They hide it.\" (223)<br />But he found something they were not able to hide.  He discovered the last revelation of Joseph Smith.  It was written the last day of his life, June 27, 1844.  It had been hidden by Brigham Young under the cover leaf of one of his personal journals.<br />Smith had said that the ability to understand truth was inherited only by the male.  Only men had the genetic tissues of right thinking.  (224)  The revelation promoted polygamy.  \"Monogamy was the devil at work...\" (224)<br />Matthew is determined to write a book, an expose.  His marriage was over and he was being kicked out of the church.  Much of the novel is what happens to Matthew after he left Salt Lake City with the incriminating evidence.<br /><br />As with any novel, it is hard to know how much Oborn has written is based on fact and how much of conjecture.  Of Joseph Smith, he writes, \"Between 1841 and 1844 the guy manages to marry on average one a month.  Can you imagine?  We're talking 'busy.'  Some of those ladies had living husbands and children...\" (167)  Even with the federal cease and desist order in 1887, the polygamists went underground, Osborn writes.  One historian estimates fifty thousand descendants alive today from the polygamous marriages performed underground between 1890 and 1906.<br /><br />This is a roughly written novel.  Much of the dialog lacks verbs or pronouns.  About the Book of Mormon: \"Get a copy...skim the book.  Reading it, far too tedious.\" (169)  Elsewhere, Oborn starts a new paragraph, \"Had called little brother from his editor's office.\" (174)  I found the style of writing very disconcerting and hard to understand.<br /><br />The action jumps back in forth in time, too.  It is the present, then four years before, then the present, then childhood, then present - all in a few pages.  It made following the story more difficult, I thought.<br /><br />Also, there is language as well as scenes that would make this book not suitable for Christian readers, in general.<br /><br />Oborn says he wrote this book to entertain people with the women's issues playing a heavy subtext.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Left me in the dark.", "text": "Laurel doesn't fit with her New York family.  The child of a guardswoman and an unknown father, she's never fit with anyone least of all when she loses her temper and accidentally unleashes her magic.  So, she's shipped off to her uncle the lord Redmantyl to learn to control her power.  She digs through his libraries in search of knowledge until he's forced to take her as an apprentice for her own good.  And then the thespers arrived.<br /><br />I'm having a bit of a hard time thinking of what to say about Maiden in Light.  It felt like the author, Katheryn Ramage, had several stories that she wanted to tell but wasn't quite sure how to put them together.  From the blurb, as I read it on Goodreads, I expected to be dropped straight into the action.  I expected to start off with Laurel becoming her uncle's apprentice, then a few chapters of that, then going off to search out the bad thing.  Instead the first half or so of the book is taken up with a rambling account of what was apparently four years of Laurel's life starting with her journey to Wizardes Cliff.  This includes setting up several characters to be far more important than they were, events that had no bearing on the plot, and some fairly minimal characterization that could have been better taken care of with more show and less tell.  The second half of the book introduces the plot that was promised in the blurb only to instead jump into excruciating detail regarding Laurel's aunt's matchmaking and setting up for a conflict that never really happened.<br /><br />I'm going to get a bit more nitpicky here than usual, Maiden in Light had potential but that got buried in problems that really shouldn't be ignored.  The pacing was really bad, the first half of the book could have covered a few months, a few weeks, or a few years.  I really couldn't tell how much time was passing until someone mentioned someone else's age for a comparison.  There were two chapters back to back that detailed visits from traveling performers, known in the book as thespers, but there was no real indication that they hadn't done anything more than leave the gate and then come right back in.<br /><br />The book also tended to get dragged down in telling about a character rather than showing them.  The readers keeps hearing about how brave and smart and dedicated to her magic Laurel is, but when the chips are down all we get to see is a fragile little girl who doesn't know what she's supposed to be doing or how to go about it.  The reader is told how horrible the merchant class kids are to Laurel, but we only see one scene of them being snarky and a bit stupid before they are set aside for the rest of the book. I feel that I should also note that Laurel is a bit of a flat earth atheist, this may not bother anyone, but it was one of the tell instead of show things that seemed to come up way more than was necessary.<br /><br />The plot doesn't start until the book is more than half over, and then it's padded so heavily with the aunt trying to get her daughters married off that it gets lost.  Then Laurel suffers the kind of character derailment that makes me just want to stop reading, throws everything we've been told about her out the window with what might have been a clumsy attempt at symbolism and proceeds to ignore any previous characterization.<br /><br />The reader also gets treated to fanciful changes of spelling for names and places and changes of name for various holidays.  This doesn't lend to the world building but instead adds to the confusion regarding time passage and who's who and from where.  An alternate history does not necessarily lead to changes that radical in language, nor should it if only for the reader's sake.  I could let this slide if the world wasn't supposed to be earth with a different history but it just reads wrong as is.<br /><br />This leads me to the final part of this review.  With all the problems I had with the writing and the story itself, I wouldn't read anything else by Ramage.  Maiden in Light had potential, but it squandered that with blocks of purple tinted prose, tons of characters who came to nothing, and too much tell but no show.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Little Help?", "text": "Reading \"How Not to Write Bad\" by Ben Yagoda is an experience similar to hearing a recording of your voice on a tape recorder for the first time. *Gaaak!* That's how I sound?  *Aaargh!* I've been writing incorrect English all these years?<br /><br />If only I had a handbook on proper writing to help me mend my errant ways.<br /><br />It happens that I have several, and this one is no better than the rest. This book's utility evaporates once you discover a that it lacks an index.  Let's say that you are confused by the most common mistake in grammar: when to use *lay* and when to use *lie.* Nobody gets that right: I've had M.D.s tell me to *lay* down on the examination table.  \"Now I lay me down to sleep?\" [[ASIN:0394702549 As I Lay Dying]]? I laid in bed all morning? I'm lying there now? -- Help!  As far as I can tell, the only way to find the answer to this in \"How Not to Write Bad\" is to read the entire book, then dog-ear (dogear - Yagoda doesn't like hyphens) the page for future reference. I now have about twenty different pages so mutilated,<br /><br />The table of contents is of no use because of Professor Yagoda's fondness for using cutesie titles:<br /> 1. Sanitized<br /> 2. Skunked<br /> 3. Still Wrong<br /> 7. When You Catch a Preposition, Kill It<br /> 8. To Use to Be or Not to Use to Be<br /> 9. What the Meaning of \"Is Is\" Is<br /><br />Professor Yagoda does mention the lay/lie quandary, but he only devotes one short and inadequate paragraph to it, after which he maintains that that one should say, \"The Count Basie band really swang!\"  No one but an English professor ever spoke such a sentence. Even [[ASIN:B000TYXYAU my 1942 Dictionary]] lists *swang* as archaic.  He spends more time quoting mistakes from the papers of his students and putting screamingly unfunny titles above them.<br /><br />Professor Yagoda is also really persnickety -- but not where it counts. In contrast to his minimal explanation of lie/lay, he spends an entire page explaining that when you abbreviate 1960s (which he wisely observes has no apostrophe) to '60s, the apostrophe appears backwards in Microsoft Word. (I'm using [[ASIN:B00009L1HV AppleWorks 6.2.9]], so I'm not having that problem.)  He then provides detailed instructions for turning the single-quote mark into a comma. If you think that's the stupidest thing you ever heard of (I mean, who cares?), Professor Yagoda, starting a sentence with a conjunction, disagrees: \"But to me it counts as bad writing.\"<br /><br />He's obsessive-compulsive about that, but he neglects to mention other knotty problems with apostrophes. I agree with him (and so does the [[ASIN:B0011A5XAA The Associated Press Stylebook]]) that the '60s should have no apostrophe before the s. (Harry Shaw in [[ASIN:B004QOAD4E Punctuate It Right]] disagrees and advises putting an apostrophe before the s, and so does [[ASIN:B000FTAB3W Warriner's English Grammar and Composition]]. I can't find any mention of this in [[ASIN:0205313426 Strunk & White]].)  How is it then, that Professor Yagoda provides no advice on including apostrophes in the following sentences?<br />\u00a7 All players with 3's on their uniforms form a line here.<br />\u00a7 Mississippi is spelled with four s's, four i's, and two p's.<br />\u00a7 Count the number of and's in that paragraph.<br /><br />To find out what to do, you'll have to purchase a better book. The same is true of the problem of when to use *whom* instead of *who*.  Only one sentence is devoted to it. *Who?* He commands us to use asterisks in place of italics when only ASCII is available, but neglects to inform us if the final asterisk is placed inside or outside the punctuation.<br /><br />Professor Yagoda stands steadfast against against neologisms to the point that he warns against what he calls \"epicene pronouns,\" which I think are just fine, and he marks the following perfectly-good sentence incorrect: \"Arcade Fire and about 20,000 of their fans turned the PNC Center into a raucous party Thursday night.\"  Surely (he advises against using \"surely\") you've winced when some enlightened author uses *she* as a pronoun for a hypothetical hedge-fund manager or bomber pilot. Now that we have come to accept women as being more-or-less equal to men, there is an aching need in the language for a gender-neutral third-person personal pronoun, but still, Professor Yagoda admonishes, \"They're not acceptable now.\"<br /><br />Very well, but then, in his list of wrong words (pg.62), he advises against using *affect* instead of *impact*!  *Impact* as a verb! *Impact* as a synonym for *effect*!  >Impact!&lt; IMPACT! (Sloooowly I turned. . . . Step by step. . . . Inch by inch.. . .  ) The worst neologism to beset the poor language during our lifetime, and he embraces it !!?!  The scoundrel!<br /><br />Likewise, he says nothing about using \"utilize\" or \"usage\" in place of good-old simple \"use.\"  This is the worst murrain ever to have infested the language, and [[ASIN:B000ULXV4G Fowler's]] says of it, \"Those who write *usage* or *user* when they mean no more than *use* must be presumed to do so for one of two bad reasons: that they prefer either the longer word to the shorter or the unusual word to the common.\"  Professor Yagoda is very stern about not using multiple exclamation points, but he ignores \"utilize.\"  And you gonna >obey&lt; this guy?  (Since reading the latest novel by Tom Wolfe, I have decided that using the more-than and less-than symbols are a more effective way of emphasizing a word than *asterisks* in ASCII.  I make-up my own rules.)<br /><br />I began to think poorly of this book during the tedious introduction, when it became painfully obvious that Professor Yagoda writes like an English teacher. He makes-up all these rules then proceeds to violate each of them. He warns that ALL CAPS  is never an acceptable means of showing emphasis, but on page 69 he shouts, DO NOT RELY ON SPELL-CHECK.  I'm fond of beginning a sentence with the rhetorical use of \"Perhaps\", but on page 116 Professor Yagoda rules against \"perhaps\" in favor of \"maybe,\" because \"Lengthy is [not] desirable; short is good.\"<br /><br />O.k. (he doesn't discuss OK), so if the shorter word is better, why's he using \"cogitation\" instead of \"thought\" in the run-on sentence on page 135: \"Usually, a writer uses a word twice because no alternative is self-evident or, sometimes, conceivable after what seems like a lengthy period of cogitation.\"<br /><br />Professor Yagoda instructs us not to employ . . . uh . . . tells us not to use clich&eacute;s, but on page 84, he uses both \"gets a clean bill of health\" and \"for all intents and purposes.\"  I can forgive the first because it sounds quaint (just what is a \"clean bill of health\" anyway? Obamacare?), but \"for all intents and purposes\" is nothing more than stock filler. Kids are mocked for littering sentences with \"like\" or \"y'know,\" but \"for all intents and purposes\" gets a clean bill of health, because it seems, like, sophisticated.<br /><br />He repeatedly cautions against using redundancies, but on page 128, he writes, \" . . . different people will have different notions on where a particular phrase lies at a particular point in time.\" The ghastly redundancy \"at this point in time\" sprouted like a wart (in Washington, as does most damage to the language) during the Watergate hearings, and I thought it went out with H. R. Haldeman, but apparently it still sounds highly elegant to the ears of Professor Yagoda.<br /><br />Throughout the book, he speaks of the importance of having a good ear for what constitutes good writing, and this is true. It also illustrates why such cardinal rules as putting the comma to the left of the quotation marks and the semicolon to the right are, in reality, trivial and silly compared with the writer's ability to communicate or report in an unambiguous and entertaining manner.<br /><br />Alas, by about page ten it becomes obvious that Professor Yagoda has a tin ear. How else can you explain his correcting a perfectly good sentence with this result: \"In a flurry we grabbed some plastic containers filled with sprouts and kimchi. The damages were $12.75.\"<br /><br />\"The damages were . . .\"?  That's something my late father would think was clever. (He also was fond of saying, \"Everything's copacetic.\")  On page 11 we find, \"I have scrawled it many times: comma splices, like the dude in [[ASIN:B00181JGI2 The Big Lebowski]], abide.\" (I added the link in case you are not familiar with >The Dude.&lt;)  What is the purpose of joining the two sentences with a colon, thus creating ambiguity as to what he scrawled?<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, and despite that he doesn't discuss the more arcane details of possessives and other baffling aspects which make English the most miserable language in the galaxy, the book does contain some useful suggestions. The section about unnecessary commas was an eye opener, and I realized that I had been making that mistake as well as several others. One's writing can always be improved, and I give the book a tentative recommendation for that reason. But because of the fatal lack of an index, the book is of little help for the person who is stuck in mid-sentence and is reaching for a handy guide to provide a quick solution.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "A first rate story, poorly written", "text": "The story of D.B. Cooper and his hijacking of a Northwest Orient jetliner just before Thanksgiving 1971 is the stuff of legends, especially in the Northwest and among many individuals that are fascinated with such crimes and the individuals that commit them. The fact that neither Cooper nor the bulk of the $200,000 he received from the airline have ever been found makes this one of those stories stranger than fiction.<br />I requested this book because it has now been some 40 years since the hijacking and still no Cooper or the money and I thought perhaps given that the author had exclusive access to FBI files and documents that at the least this book would bring me up to date on the status of this remarkable story. No such luck. This is really a gossip sheet and is very amateurish at best. The author brings characters into the story without any background on why they are there and when he does explain their importance it is due to some information he received from someone else and in the end many do not significantly contribute to the book in any meaningful way. The sentences are almost childish in their composition and many are 3-4 words long. There is no real analysis of what the author finds during his efforts to locate Cooper or what the significance of his findings really are. The notes section at the end of the book should be an embarrassment to the author and publisher and the bibliography is nonexistent.<br />This subject deserves a balanced, objective look at the hijacking and myriad of developments in the search for Cooper and the money over the past 40 years.

The novel was full of terms that are new to the 21st century, such as tasked with and gifted with.  Then there was 'heir and a spare' and 'limelight'.  It's possible that that the former was used before it referred to princes William and Harry, but I doubt it was used when childhood mortality was as high as it was during Henry VIII's reign.  You would have wanted more than a single spare.  And 'limelight' would have been unknown in the time period, not identified until 1820 and the term not known to non-scientists until at least 1840; hundreds of years after Tudor times.<br /><br />Further, the callous way that Margaret treated her widowed daughter-in-law made me lose all sympathy for her.  As she actually did the deed the author couldn't have left it out of a book about the woman, but I question the desire to write about the woman.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Okay if you have a few hours to kill", "text": "Death Unmasked<br />By: Rick Sulik<br /><br />Detective Sean Jamison, months\u2014maybe weeks\u2014away from retirement from the Houston Police Dept., suddenly realizes he\u2019s lived before, perhaps many times. While he works toward solving what he hopes will be his last case in THIS life (a serial killer murdering women in Houston), he\u2019s also looking for the love of his LAST life, a woman raped and killed by a Nazi officer.<br /><br />It\u2019s confusing; I know. Yet, the idea of reincarnation mixed with a modern-day murder mystery was intriguing to me. So, I bought the book.<br />First, let me tell you what I liked most about it:<br /><br />(1) Mr. Sulik\u2019s story is very imaginative and unique. It is basically a cop/killer mystery with an added twist of re-incarnated lovers finding one another in this life after tragically losing each other in a past life. The story is both horrifying and frightening AND romantic and sweet all at the same time. I\u2019ve never read anything like it.<br /><br />(2) Mr. Sulik DOES have talent. When he paints the pictures of the WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY and HOW details of the story they are sharply and artistically drawn.<br /><br />(3) Most of Mr. Sulik\u2019s characters (Det. Jamison and his co-workers for example) are honorable, witty and likeable.<br /><br />Now, let me tell you what I had trouble with:<br /><br />(1) On his way to work one morning, Det. Jamison suffers a blinding headache, pulls over to the side of the road, almost passes out and then\u2014OUT OF THE BLUE\u2014suddenly realizes he has been reincarnated. Not only that, he also instantly becomes aware that his lady love from his last life has also been reincarnated AND lives somewhere in his same city of Houston. He must find her at all cost.<br />a. Uh\u2026 huh? Do those kinds of realizations always hit a person so suddenly and so completely, so cleanly without warning? Without a psychic reading? Without a magician\u2019s hypnosis act gone wrong? Something\u2026<br /><br />I don\u2019t mean to sound so sarcastic. Truly. I just found the suddenness of the revelation\u2014and the fully realized history of it\u2014to be a little\u2026unbelievable.<br /><br />(2) I also had trouble with Mr. Sulik\u2019s writing style when it came to conversations between characters. Their speech was always stilted, unnatural and the rhythm was all wrong. No one speaks the way these characters do. Words, phrases\u2026they either didn\u2019t fit the situation, the character or the time. Occasionally these Houston TEXAS detectives sounded more like Brooklyn beat cops, Boston gang members or Montagues and Capulets.  NONE of the conversations seemed realistic to me. Every time I came across a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate I was pulled so thoroughly from the story that I had to force myself to continue.<br /><br />(3) There is a smaller side story in which one of the lesser characters falls in love with another in an afternoon after knowing this man for years. She falls so completely and so hard\u2026 and so quickly\u2026well, it was just so implausible. And, in my own humble opinion, it was an unnecessary \u201ctwist\u201d. It really served no purpose.<br /><br />(4) Lastly, in the last few chapters of the book, the story becomes very \u2026convoluted and just plain odd. Not only is Jamison re-incarnated along with his past-life mate and one or two others; one of the other detectives suddenly begins remote-viewing the killer and no one is surprised or taken aback in any way. Another detective suddenly realizes he knows the whole recent and past-life history of the killer\u2014because of course, he too is paranormal. It just goes on and on\u2026<br /><br />Suddenly, toward the end of the book, DEATH UNMASKED becomes an un-authorized episode of X-Files\u2014on Steroids! It\u2019s just SO much, SO fast, SO\u2026weird.<br /><br />The wrap up is so complicated and long-winded that it\u2019s entirely unsatisfying and maddening.<br /><br />Here\u2019s where it becomes complicated for me: As I was telling my husband all about this book over the breakfast table this morning I found myself defending it when he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you finished it. I would have just closed it and never picked it up again.\u201d<br />\u201cBut, I kind of liked it!\u201d I cried. That\u2019s when I realized, right out of the blue (yes, I get the irony) that it wasn\u2019t a bad book and I did indeed like some of it. I just think Mr. Sulik needs to work on his conversational writing skill. And, unfortunately, I think he went off the rails a little bit toward the end.<br /><br />BUT\u2026it\u2019s a book with a great plot and a unique twist. I kind of liked it. Other readers may love it.<br /><br />Just know going in that it is a book with issues.", "images": [], "asin": "1938985834", "parent_asin": "1938985834", "user_id": "AHUALHQGIUD6HTNZD5AUQK5UTZOQ", "timestamp": 1487882489000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

There was much confusion for me trying to keep reality and delusion separated. Many times I wasn't sure who was narrating since there were alternating narratives. There were diary entries which helped to keep the plot recognizable but when dealing with characters who are paranoid, it sometimes was disconcerting.<br /><br />I liked the story line about achieving old papers and a famous author whose home was on grounds with a mental hospital and an old tower, both structures playing a big part in the novel.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Decent sequel", "text": "I feel a certain loyalty to Harriet, since the original Harriet the Spy was one of my favorite books as a kid. I had my doubts about the two sequels, each written by different authors after Louis Fitzhugh's too-soon death, but both did a fairly good job of staying true to the spirit of Harriet.<br /><br />Harriet the Spy Double Agent, is a bit better than Harriet spies Again, because Harriet is more her old note-taking self and spends more time talking to Sport, who himself is going through his own turmoil what with his dad's new wife, being in love, and sprouting a few facial hairs. Double Agent also hints (maybe as a tribute to Fitzhugh?) at Harriet's budding sexuality as she discovers and ruminates about her own feelings about Sport, Ole Golly, and her new intriguing friend and spy partner, Annie Smith, who has created three names and personalities for herself and has a few secrets of her own.<br /><br />Harriet Spies Again (which comes before Double Agent, if you want to read them in order) feels a little empty, as there is very little spying, note taking or interaction with Harriet's friends, and the whole Ole Golly reunion falls kind of flat. Also, it may have been less obvious what was going on with Ole Golly to a younger reader, but to me it was pretty predictable.<br /><br />Missing from both books is Fitzhugh's wry wit, but these sequels are worth a read if, as a now-grown adult fan, you can ignore that feeling that you're visiting a ghost.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "\"My mind was an angry dog, chasing after endless cars.\"", "text": "As the fourth novel in the Edie Spence series starts, Edie is in trouble again.  She's going on a long waited for vacation with her soulmate, the shapeshifter Asher, and it's a cruise, and maybe she's pregnant.  Edie's confused, can a fey actually get a mundane human pregnant? Well, the answer will surprise nobody, but until she knows for sure, she decides to keep Asher in the dark about this.<br /><br /> As Edie hates being on the high seas, she's either suffering from sea sickness or morning sickness.  Ah, what the heck, why not suffer from both?  Fun times.<br /><br /> But both Asher and Edie will have more to worry about than Edie's pregnancy as somebody from Asher's sordid background has resurfaced on their little cruise to happiness.<br /><br /> Cassie Alexander essentially flushes away all of Edie's past supporting cast and starts afresh with whole new plotlines and characters in an attempt to create a book that can be read independently.  Unfortunately, it's also a book that seems to take frigging forever to get started.  I had to struggle to keep reading, as while Alexander tosses us a hint or two as to what's coming, it really takes until almost page EIGHTY for anything to happen.<br /><br /> And then things go from bad to worse for Edie, as people start getting sick, and then people start getting dead, and Edie's condition starts getting worse, is she infected?  And the person behind everything seems to be Asher's old employer/enemy.<br /><br /> And then Edie becomes a mommy by proxy.<br /><br /> And if you think that things couldn't get any worse, the Shadows show up.  The Shadows are a race of wraithlike creatures that feed on strong negative emotions, and they're almost invulnerable, however, now they need Edie's help.  And they're scared.  Something bad is coming, and of course, this does nothing to calm Edie down as she can't conceive of anything that could scare the Shadows.<br /><br /> Then the dead, and the living, start mutating, as there is something that is growing inside them, and these things want out, out of their hosts.<br /><br /> About the halfway mark Alexander has clearly left this series' roots in the urban fantasy field long behind it, as with this novel gives us a plague, monsters, madness, madmen, mad scientists, murder, conspiracies, horror, terrorists, and lots of bloody death.  \"Deadshifted\" by Cassie Alexander eventually starts reading more like a novel as published by Permuted Press rather than an urban fantasy.<br /><br /> On the good side, this is a novel that actively puts Alexander's, and by proxy, Edie's medical background to really good use, and realistically portrays the selflessness of those that are dedicated nurses.  Kudos for this.<br /><br /> On the negative side, well, where does one begin?  The long drawn-out start of this novel is one.  Does it really take EIGHTY PAGES to start a novel?  No, it doesn't.<br /><br /> Then there is the ending.  Well, there isn't one.  There are too many plotlines left dangling, and the novel itself just kinda, sorta, more or less runs out of pages without wrapping anything up.<br /><br />******Spoilers ahead******<br /><br /> I wasn't surprised to find out that there are marine fey, but the rules seem rather vague.  Okay, mermaids can become landbound, but to do so they have change to a landbound creature.  And how do they do this?  Uh, good question.  Evidently they have to suck the air out of somebody, and then through sheer willpower they can change.  Oh yes, and they can change us mere mortals into fey if they want to.  How?  Good question.  It's never really answered, and why didn't this mermaid save her landbound husband?<br /><br /> And then there are the monsters that pop up after the three-quarter mark.  These creatures evolve inside people and then destroy the hosts, escape to the sea, and replicate,  So what happens to the thousands that are now loose in the ocean?  Aw heck, why ask?<br /><br /> Then about the Leviathan that has the Shadows running so scared?  This thing is massive, and it's a shipkiller, and it's loose in the ocean.  Loose.  Plot.  Thread.<br /><br /> And then there is what eventually happens to Edie.  Clearly Alexander has either no respect for her audience, or she had written herself into a corner.  However, even I can see where Alexander took a wrong turn here.  I don't like these stupid cliffhangers, or these open endings.  They're crass money grabs, and they are a form of literary blackmail that demands that the reader fork over their cash and time for the next novel.<br /><br /> Edie has always been a mortal woman, feisty to be sure, but still a mortal woman trying to deal with the much stronger paranormal, and keep her head above water while doing this.  As such, she represented the everywoman that the reader could identify with.  Well, forget that now, Edie's not going to be Edie anymore.<br /><br /> And considering the dire direction that this series is bound and determined to go, I'm not sure I even care to read or buy any of the future novels in this series.  Because of all of these faults, and because of Edie's constant boneheaded decisions, I almost gave this book two stars, but the book's last half, until the god awful last few pages, does rock.  But really, Alexander is just coasting here, and the stakes are high, there's just too much to read to keep giving us these duds.

Under Obama, even the USA space program is gone - went to Russia and China.<br /><br />There is ONE sentence in the whole book that describes India. page 424  Jennifer and Veena are in a VERY BAD slum area and see infants, toddlers, etc. living in total squalor, rickety and impermanent shelters.  Jennifer asks Veen \"When you see this, doesn't it make you sad?\".  Veena answers\" No.  It's their karma.\"<br /><br />Veena CONDONES the India caste system (per-determined by birth status in society) and disdainfully dismisses these \"lower class\" people forced to live in wretched poverty with ZERO hope of becoming anything better because if a family cleans sewers or whatever NO ONE WILL EVER hire them to do anything else.  Yet, Veena wants to migrate to the USA where she can spread her caste crap.<br /><br />Maybe it was a different type of karma that punished Veena by having her be raped by her father for years.  I hope karma further punishes her by denying her a USA visa and she rots in hell for killing Jennifer's grandmother and gets her nursing license pulled so she can live in squalor.<br /><br />Note:  It is unrealistic that Jennifer would forgive Veena for killing her grandmother.  It wouldn't be fair to the grandmother if Veena did NOT go to jail and what about the other nurses who killed other patients in the exact same way.

Koontz does have the ability to make you want to keep reading, and that's why I rate this 2 stars instead of just 1.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The Wrong Reich", "text": "You ever have one of those crazy bosses?<br /><br />She would blast ecological sounds so loudly we had to ask her to turn it down (our jobs included listening to actors read lines). Another time, she called in sick because she was \"wafting vapors.\" She always brought up her education in conversation.  She never seemed to actually do any work, but instead worked on her novel, using company resources to write it.  And she was strangely preoccupied with \"ganja\" to the point that she used it as her password, a fact she was only too happy to share. \"Wafting vapors\" indeed.<br /><br />After I finished reading Nickel and Dimed, I was convinced Ehrenreich was my former boss. A highly-educated journalist with an arch tone, she blesses us all with her insights by going undercover as a poor person and trying to get by.  Which is a bit like the scene from Aladdin when the princess slips out into the real world.<br /><br />You see, Ehrenreich wants to help people.  She really does, and she views things in a sort of black and white, my way or the highway sort of charitable aggressiveness.  She's an ideological bully, the kind that is impossible to argue with because she cloaks herself with the cause of the underdog.<br /><br />And that's a shame, because Ehrenreich's absolutely right in what she uncovers: that the poor can't get by on minimum wage salaries in the year 2000. The only way to survive is to have a partner, she concludes, but with that comes the baggage of living with another person, possibly children, and all that entails.  And yet, Ehrenreich's experiment lacks precisely that - when she is given the opportunity o move in with a friend, she turns it down.<br /><br />Ehrenreich isn't a poor person.  In fact, she is so NOT poor that she secretly feels she should be treated differently because she's better educated, or because she's a journalist, or because she's trying to help people when clearly bosses are greedy and poor people are too weak to fend for themselves.<br /><br />In my first job, I worked in a factory.  I've come a long way from that factory job, but it taught me a lot as a high school student.  And what's missing most from Ehrenreich's tour in Poor People Land is that these people aren't characters in her book; they're real people.  Ehrenreich never seems to detach herself from her upbringing, although she would have us believe otherwise.  The signs, if you read carefully, are there.<br /><br />The one that really turned me off was the fact that Ehrenreich, due to an \"indiscretion,\" smokes pot when she knows she'll be going on job interviews.  Now either Ehrenreich didn't know job interviews required drug testing, which speaks poorly to her journalistic abilities, or she has a fondness for pot she fails to disclose as part of who she is.  From there it's railing against the system of drug testing, a charge that becomes shrill when she beats the test and sees that as further evidence that drug testing is dumb. There are lots of hard working poor folks who aren't smoking pot before job interviews, and Ehrenreich isn't doing the underrepresented poor any favors by succumbing to the stereotype.<br /><br />The other hypocrisy is that Ehrenreich bristles at psychological tests.  I agree with her, I hated those tests too.  She objects to the tone of the questions and their underlying agenda, but the back of the book contains a \"reader's guide\" that asks such loaded questions as, \"have you ever been homeless, unemployed, without health insurance, or held down two jobs?  What is the lowest-paying job you ever held and what kind of help--if any--did you need to improve your situation?\" The lack of self-awareness rife throughout the book is breathtaking.<br /><br />The final indignity is when Ehrenreich, the educated white woman who knows better, decides on a lark to start a union at Wal-Mart.  Heedless of what the consequences might be, she just skips right out of that final job into her conclusions.  Never mind that Ehrenreich was intentionally rabble-rousing workers who, if they had decided to try to form a union, could have all lost their jobs.  And where would that leave them, while Ehrenreich went back to her comfortable house?<br /><br />But if you can look past that, and I'm sure a lot of people can't, the book's messages are sound.  The end result of a capitalist system in America is ultimately hostile to itself.  The rich need the poor to work as cheaply and inexpensively as possible, and this form of human labor market ultimately degrades the bottom ranks until they rebel. Ehrenreich doesn't have any answers as to why the poor haven't rebelled already and instead concludes with navel-gazing reader's guide.<br /><br />Nickel and Dimed should be required reading for CEOs everywhere who are often responsible for the fates of thousands of peoples' livelihoods.  I just wish Ehrenreich hadn't written it.", "images": [], "asin": "0805088385", "parent_asin": "0805088385", "user_id": "AFGDOWXYBXW46W56NEVSOPWFKLWA", "timestamp": 1218918403000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Decent enough, but a little too overly long for its plot", "text": "This is kind of an odd book to review. It's such a strange read in that it kind of likes to play with your mind as you're reading, to the point where you kind of have to re-read a page or two just to make sure that what you've read is what happened. However at the same time it just seems like Nevill tried a little too hard to trump the oddness and strangeness he's inserted into his earlier works.<br /><br />There are some great scenes in this book and at times you'll find it difficult to put this book down because you'll be that desperate to know what the great mystery is and what exactly will happen to all of the various people in this book. Our lead character of Catherine is sort of wishy washy, which both helps and hurts the book at points. It does help explain why she'd be so willing to put up with the ridiculousness she does, but at the same time it kind of makes you shake your head at what she does put up with in order to complete the job. At times she's just so passive that you just want for the Big Bad to happen already because she just doesn't seem to have that much fight in her to last the rest of the book.<br /><br />That brings me to the biggest flaw of the book: it's just too long. It's just under 400 pages, but the story here almost felt like it could have been told in about 250-300 pages. Too much time is spent hinting at the mysteries and exploring the house, so that I was a little underwhelmed when the book did start moving towards its climax. There are some great scenes, but drawing them out gives the reader plenty of time to see where things are going- especially if they've read some of Nevill's previous works.<br /><br />Still, there's enough here to entertain us fans of his work and to continue to draw in new fans. It's not his best work- I'd say that Last Days is my favorite of his works so far- but it's still pretty entertaining for the most part.

This being so, when I have extensively read the Qur'an and hadith sources on the topic, so I was familiar with the content.  Yet, I still learned additional cures for the evil eye, which was new knowledge for me.<br /><br />This is the third book I have read on the Jinns-which included a self-published one-and this came out on top.  It skims over topics, but covers the essentials, which is sufficient for the layman.  The belief of the author is sound and solid, and it is evident from his writings.  His book is extremely beneficial for a majority of Muslims-including the well educated ones-who are easily led astray when faced with this subject.  Many a Muslim is tricked by charlatans, who exploit the lack of sound faith and religious knowledge in the victims.  The author has put things in the right perspective.  My prior readings corroborate his statements.<br /><br />The book however, has 3 major shortcomings:<br />1.  There is a dire need for professional editing, from an experienced American editor.  There are too many repetitions, and the grammar needs polishing.  Darusalam distributes internationally, and its high time they learn and adopt international standards.<br /><br />2. The book lacks citations in about 30-40% of the content.  No statement, name, claim or phenomenon can be printed without a citation.  Refer to point #1.<br /><br />3.  There are a few weak hadith referenced here. This makes one question the author's sources of research.  In the presence of the sihah sitta, the massive body of reliable hadith, it should be the sole source of a Muslim scholar.  One who quotes weak hadith raises questions about his work.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Another Disappointment from Ehrenreich", "text": "For some unfathomable reason, I keep hoping that Barbara Ehrenreich will finally produce an insightful analysis of something. This never happens, however, and the only thing I take away from her books is a sense of disappointment. Ehrenreich's latest subject seemed so promising that I bought her book. She takes on the perennial cheerfulness, perkiness, and optimism that characterizes (to use Terry Eagleton's beautiful phrase) \"the genetically upbeat Americans.\"<br /><br />Positive thinking, says Ehrenreich, is \"beginning to be an obligation imposed on all American adults.\" Ehrenreich describes the constant efforts to promote positive thinking within companies that, according to her, are now seeping into the academic world. I don't know much about the corporate world and whether the cheery mood is obligatory there. I do know, however, that Ehrenreich is completely wrong when she says that cheerfulness and positive thinking are becoming popular in academia. Academics are the whiniest bunch of people you will ever meet. We love bitching, complaining, moaning, and sighing. Recently, I have been feeling simply ecstatic about my new job, but I can see that even the people who gave me the job in question are being repelled by my enthusiasm. Everybody expects me to complain and when I don't my fellow academics seem a little disoriented.<br /><br />Ehrenreich believes that human beings are nothing more than tiny little objects at the mercy of blind forces beyond our comprehension. She is a fierce materialist who believes that our circumstances are the only thing that defines our lives. She is consequently very annoyed by any worldview that believes in the possible victory of spirit over matter. In her opinion, thinking that you can achieve anything you want if you work really hard at it and want it really badly is wrong because it obscures reality. Apparently, she cannot accept that everybody's version of reality is very different and that some people might be justified in shaping their own reality.<br /><br />Ehrenreich's one-dimensional materialism seems boring and overly aggressive. She insists that your happiness depends on your income, an idea that is profoundly alien to me. I accept her right to be an atheist and a materialist. I don't think that any one deserves scorn and ridicule for possessing this worldview. It would be nice to see Ehrenreich respond in kind to people who are religious and/or seek other explanations than the purely materialistic type that she promotes. I, for one, do believe that human beings have a lot more agency in the world that Ehrenreich allows for (I mean, I have a lot more agency. If Ehrenreich doesn't want this agency, then she definitely shouldn't try to exercise it.)<br /><br />The author's hatred of motivational speakers is so profound that she is even willing to present the most notorious Wall Street criminals as poor unwitting victims of the \"positive thinking\" movement. According to Ehrenreich, Joe Gregory, the former president of Lehman's Brothers, is not really guilty of his company's collapse. It's the bad, mean, positive-thinking ideology that makes people believe they can achieve anything they want that is to blame for his actions and the company's demise. It is very surprising to see a hard-core liberal like Ehrenreich giving an absolution to a bunch of greedy individuals like Gregory, but there it is.<br /><br />It seems that Ehrenreich read too many self-help books in the process of doing research for Bright-sided and couldn't help but borrow some of their tricks. She decides to end her book with a piece of advice on how we should conduct our lives: \"The alternative to both [positive thinking and depression] is to try to get outside of ourselves and see things 'as they are,' or as uncolored as possible by our own feelings and fantasies.\" At least, Ehrenreich has the good sense of putting \"as they are\" in quotation marks. This demonstrates that the author herself is a little ashamed of her childishly naive way of offering advice to people whose worldview might be a little bit more complicated than her reductive materialism.<br /><br />To summarize: the book is boring, uninsightful, poorly constructed, unconvincing, and intellectually barren.", "images": [], "asin": "0805087494", "parent_asin": "0805087494", "user_id": "AEJP557V5GGMT74RJBHACELPQGUA", "timestamp": 1275761801000, "helpful_vote": 94, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "No thanks.", "text": "Perhaps these writers are not for me because as like with \"The Wife Between Us,\" I did not enjoy this read. On first glance, the premise is intriguing. Jessica Farris, a struggling makeup artist, overhears a conversation during a work session about a morality study where participants will receive $500. The girl originally invited won't attend so Jessica Farris goes in her place. The questions are invasive covering a span of topics covering honesty, trust, deceit, even murder. Though she is semi-uncomfortable, she continues with the study because she does need the compensation. Soon though, she begins to realize she signed up for more than she bargained for.<br /><br />I think the writers tried to do too much with the characters and the plot. Oftentimes it felt convoluted, like everything was being thrown at the wall. It didn't feel cohesive to me. I also grew frustrated with the narration and the character's voices. There was a stiffness to Dr. Shields and Jessica, for lack of a better word, was rather annoying. It's hard to become invested in a novel when you can't get behind a character, even if they're unlikable. On a final note, one thing that irked me was Dr. Shields' motivations for the study.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A superb story premise, but it muddles and fizzles quickly", "text": "I showed the publisher's description of this mystery-adventure novel to my wife just after I ordered this book and she said, \"That sounds like a really great one.\" I had harbored precisely the same thought so I was fully prepared to burn the midnight oil on this title. Unfortunately, my expectations did not come to fruition.<br /><br />I'm going to give somewhat lengthy details of my critique because, if the author (Katherine Neville) happens across my mediocre rating of her book, she is entitled to hear EXACTLY WHY I did not care much for the work. Unfortunately, others might find this approach to be a little excessive but I take book reviews quite seriously (especially critical ones) and just saying, \"I didn't like this book,\" would be entirely unfair to the author who worked so hard on it.<br /><br />First, here's the story in a nutshell which I will convey with an eye to coherence rather than to just regurgitate the tale in the order in which it is yielded up by the author:<br /><br />The chief heroine/protagonist, Alexandra Solarin, works in an exclusive Washington D.C. Basque specialty restaurant where she is being trained by the owner in the perfectionist art of preparing fine ethnic cuisine. Then she gets a strange invitation to attend her mother's birthday party at her mom's isolated Colorado home.<br /><br />The mystery centers chiefly upon the pieces and playing board of an infamous chess set which is called The Montglane Service. This chess theme links to Alexandra in that she happens to be a chess genius and was well on the way to becoming a Master when her father who was accompanying her to a match in Russia was shot by an assassin.<br /><br />In any event, the chess set of focus was devised in Baghdad by Islamic alchemist al-Jabir ibn Hayan in 765 C.E for the Caliph al-Mansur and was actually an encoded device for housing the mysteries of... well, what would be the most precious thing to any mortal human? And I'll leave the answer there. Perhaps a revealing excerpt from early in the story would also be expeditious here:<br /><br />\"...the secret of the marvelous chess set. It was a formula which, if solved, could do far more than create or destroy civilizations. It could transform both energy and matter and much, much else,\" (page 94).<br /><br />In fact, there are numerous retrospectives between Hayan's day and 2003 (and at many chronological stops in between) which describe the happenings with the various chess pieces and the people who have been charged with their eternal safety and security, many of these folks losing their lives in the process. And who all is involved in this tangle? To name just a few: Charlemagne; Percy Shelly; Napoleon's mother; Tsar Alexander I; The U.S. Secret Service (sort of); The KGB; Talleyrand of France; The Piscataway Indians; Thoth of Egypt (obliquely); numerous ancient rulers and religious figures; and, many, many more. Sound confusing? It is. I began to think that Neville forgot to toss in Elvis and it was at about that point in the text that he popped up too!<br /><br />The difficulties with this book are more general than they are specific. In the interest of clarity, I'll enumerate them:<br /><br />1. This book has no core... no soul. I couldn't latch on to any of the principals and empathize with them for the literary ride. There are just way too many famous people and a similar number of exotic locations, all too excessive to make the story believable.<br /><br />2. The endless pieces of this puzzle are not limited to the attempted theme of the Montglane [Chess] Service, the object which sets the stage for a mystery which is multi-dimensional a. in international settings, b. in time (from 765 C.E. to present day), and, c. in varying religious faiths as well. At just about the time that one believes that he or she has caught up with all the clues and dates, the author bombards us with yet another set of people, places, and times and after a few cycles of this, \"the kitchen sink\" comes to mind.<br /><br />3. Alexandra and a number of her family members, peers, and associates are into interpreting codes and ciphers. Honestly, I found this aspect of the text to reek of juvenilia. At first I thought it to be a joke but after the fourth or fifth inanely written puzzle, in an adventure which purportedly takes itself seriously, I found it to be incongruous. While such caveats might have been appropriate in a tongue-and-cheek action thriller, perhaps in [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]] where there are some intentional moments of levity, these inconsistent brain-teasers took away from the seriousness of this particular story.<br /><br />4. I never achieved a good mental vision of the characters in this book, Leda being the lone exception, (her description is quite nicely-rendered on page 149) -- this was a missed opportunity. While the principals' relationships to one another were fairly clear, (at least within the parameters of each chronological period), the general lack of character wallpaper generated an overall void which could have been so easily filled but wasn't.<br /><br />5. At the outset of each chapter the author has inserted a quotation or two which purportedly punctuates the theme or object of the upcoming segment of text. This technique has, quite unfortunately, become much hackneyed and its employment in the face of this fact is quite unimaginative; when the practice is not used shrewdly and sparingly, the aggregate of the quotes simply begin to manifest as literary debris which is the case in this instance. To make matters even worse, one of these quotations, found on page 248, conveyed a tidbit by hedonist, astrologer, drug addict, and illuminist, Aleister Crowley, (1875-1947) a non-credible scoundrel of the First Water who was dubbed by the tabloid press of his day as `The Wickedest Man in the World,' and who claimed, among other titles, that of `Magus'. Even the readings at Crowley's cremation service (his own writings) were referred to in the press as 'A Black Mass,' an actuality which would have pleased the heinous mystic and alchemist on the highest level. Now, had the author also supplemented her book exclusively with quotations from people with like reputations and personalities such as Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, Osama bin Laden, Reverend Jim Jones, and so on, I would have found Crowley's entry to be appropriate and not at all offensive. But her other quotations were chiefly from credible folks such as Alexander Dumas, W.B. Yeats, Charles Dickens and obliquely, the quotations come off (inadvertently, I'm sure) as if she were placing these other reputably notable people all in the same fraternity with Crowley. Somewhat in Neville's defense, Crowley's words were clearly employed resultant of his connections with the game of chess and with his extensive knowledge of codes and cyphers. But, to finalize this thought, I just felt that tossing the likes of Crowley in with Dumas and Company was an inattentive oversight and a mistake which should have been resisted. Perhaps this seems a small point but it is representative of gaffes which I seemed to encounter throughout the text.<br /><br />6. I love books which insert a food/cooking interest. This one plugs into that appeal but we are hung out with no resolution at these opportune culinary moments. Alexandra speaks of the delectability of her Uncle's pancakes, among other items, but we're left to our own devices to ascertain WHY they were so great. We are given no secret ingredients, nor are the Uncle's special techniques revealed. Food is described throughout the book in complimentary terms and, fancying myself as an amateur chef, I really desired to latch on to this sub-interest... but I felt DEPRIVED to say the least! Even if the secret techniques would not work in actuality, as long as they had sounded plausible I would have been much gratified. I just wish that the author had developed this notion, having brought it in to begin with.<br /><br />7. The technical errors, though not legion, are still of an individual magnitude as to really spoil this tale, even if everything else had been okay. In fact, someday, I am going to get rich by inventing the \"novel writer's revolver\" which features an UNNECESSARY safety and which, by its existence will bail book authors out of a mess which I once thought would eventually cease to occur in the literary world - but again, it has sadly popped up here. On page 425, one of the book's evil characters clicks the safety to the off position on a small pearl-handled revolver! This is an amateurish mistake and should NEVER happen. I emitted a great sigh of annoyance when it did. In an earlier part of the book, (page 148), Alexandra shuts down the burglar alarm in the restaurant where she works and when she ingresses the building, her friend, Leda, is already there. Does Leda's body mass somehow not set off burglar alarms? Again, these types of obvious errors in a book that is supposedly professionally published drag down the story. Another glitch I'm pretty well assured of caught my attention here. There is a reference to the \"famous gingko bilbao trees\" on page 275. Gingko Bilbao (I'm pretty certain on this) is the DRUG BRAND NAME for a non-pharmaceutical herbal curative which addresses men's weakening libido. The TREE from which it is extracted is actually the \"Ginkgo\" and for which the scientific name is \"Ginkgo biloba\" (so-called for its two-lobed leaves -- note the differences in the spelling of both words) So what this tells me is the publisher's fact-checker found it expedient to just track down the name of the herb extract, and not the tree itself. Perhaps the author had the Basque city of Bilbao, Spain in mind from her researching. I don't know but it was a sad hoot when I read that. Finally, there was a piece of dialogue (page 276) where one of the principals says, \"Your Flat?\" he snorted. \"A campground has more amenities.\" I'm sorry but today's campgrounds (some specialty ones are also called RV Parks) are quite up to date in terms of technology and luxury, many offering everything from internet connections to Jacuzzis to one-stop shopping in the camp store. I got the feeling that the author had not \"camped\" in the past 30 years. I'm not discussing typos with all these items -- these are errors of fact, sloppy work on someone's part.<br /><br />Now, I wish to emphasize that this book is NOT a piece of trash... I don't at all want to leave prospective readers with totally negative impressions here. In fact I believe that this book could be improved 100 percent given some high-quality editing and a little additional character development - the work holds every potential of rising to five stars. From my view, I hold the editor to be at least equally responsible as the author in this work's shortcomings, whatever they might be. Clearly, there will be people who will breeze through the book as it stands and they will enjoy it. It's just that, having read a number of works which embrace similarities of theme and literary profile, in addition to the hundreds of non-paralleling novels that I've read and many of which having struck me as terrific, that this one just did not make the grade.<br /><br />Probably the best compliment that I can pay this novel is that it stands on its own even though it is, in fact, a sequel to a work which the author published 20 years ago. I didn't read that earlier entry ([[ASIN:0345419081 The Eight]]) but Katherine Neville did effect a fine job of making this book \"whole\" in that it's unnecessary to read the prequel to understand this later book. I should also say that I can appreciate the research that Neville must have performed in order to attempt to make the text as real as possible. This is a much more difficult task than simply writing a book solely from the knowledge which one accumulates over the years, penning a novel from that typically common, everyday information. And finally, the account is uniquely rendered in first person for the contemporary periods and in third person for the retrospectives - I've never encountered this before so perhaps this breaks some new ground in that realm, or at least it did for me. It's a well-established fact that writing a novel in first person is typically a challenge for even the best of authors.<br /><br />However, this work does not break new ground as far as the particular theme goes - various aspects of the instant work have previously been explored in such books as \"The Celestine Prophecy, (James Redfield); \"The List of Seven,\" (Mark Frost); \"Gospel,\" (Wilton Barnhardt); \"River God,\" (Wilbur A. Smith); and in various Clive Cussler titles. In fact I would point out that, in addition to the previous contemporary titles and authors, there are two superb, older works which hold similarities of premise and/or in thematic approach: [[ASIN:0395957753 The Robe]] and, [[ASIN:0375757856 The Moonstone (Modern Library Classics)]], each of which were as solid and coherent as this one is perplexing and vague.<br /><br />In summary, my expectations for this book had been pretty high in the beginning, having read the publisher's description but at the end, I finished the story only with considerable difficulty, chiefly embracing the distracting thought that the next book on my \"to read\" shelf would make up ground for this one. This novel is 435 pages in length and I found it neither compelling nor dynamic. It's just way too over-dramatized with too many tenuous (or non-existent) links. I also didn't care one bit for the bling-bling approach of \"Lily's Gramp\" going down in the North Tower of the World Trade Center on 9-11-01 as she was to meet him for an appointment. That idea has already been over-used and I found it as tasteless this time as I did in the very first instance that I encountered it.<br /><br />I gave this book three stars instead of two as a consequence of my personal fever for historical fiction. In recommending it to others who do not necessarily share my devotion to the topic, I'm not sure that I could go three stars.", "images": [], "asin": "0345500679", "parent_asin": "0345500679", "user_id": "AEY36S3ZOJMNBC4DDZLTHD5E3M6Q", "timestamp": 1224148292000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Too much work for too little payoff", "text": "While there\u2019s a decent story in this book, a bit of a mystery, for me, it took far too much work to ferret it out. From the gimmicky chapter numbering which jumps all over the place, to the chapters consisting of a single page picture, there\u2019s no timeline to grab onto, and I often felt myself scrambling to figure out exactly when things were happening. I found myself needing to keep a running summary of each chapter as I read. To me, this is work; not the enjoyment I expect from a book. I felt that the summary left much to be wanted in describing this book.<br /><br />The book got off to very slow start. It took me three days to read the first 30 pages. After that point, things picked up and the book finally developed a rhythm I could get into. Still, I could never relax into this book because of how the timeline, or lack thereof, jumped around.<br /><br />This book has many, many triggers for those who are sensitive.  Here they are, if you're interested:<br />child abandonment, cancer, murder, drug use, death, snakes, rape, sadistic behavior<br /><br />The book is dark and haunting. The characters are interesting, but I never felt that they were fully fleshed out. It seemed like the author had the desire to try to shock the reader in every way possible, but often without any real payoff for the reader.<br /><br />The writing itself is quite good, at times almost poetic. Unfortunately, I think the book could have been much shorter. The author enjoyed showing all the lurid and horrible at the expense of character development and story pace. For instance, the chapters with Alvero and Flaca could have been cut in half, or even to a quarter of the length in this final version. It\u2019s point is to show Alvero\u2019s oddities and how they affected Penny, but I didn\u2019t feel that it really worked all that well. It involved snakes, and I\u2019m no fan of them, so that may have some influence on my opinion.<br /><br />I did like Penny and Cale and some of the other characters, but not enough to really care what happens to them. I guess that was good because I didn\u2019t come away feeling that I knew what happened to them. Too much was left unexplained.<br /><br />I can\u2019t say that this book is a favorite read of mine. It isn\u2019t. I think it could have been, if the author hadn\u2019t worked so hard to make it such a difficult, disagreeable read. To make it worse, I didn\u2019t feel rewarded for all of my hard work in the end. It wasn\u2019t a very satisfying conclusion in my eyes and left several threads flailing in the wind.<br /><br />I doubt I\u2019ll be recommending this book to anyone. It\u2019s certainly not a book I intend to keep or read again. I found it very disappointing. It definitely wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, and I doubt I\u2019ll be looking for other books by this author.<br /><br />I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway.
