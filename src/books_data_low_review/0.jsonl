{"label": -1, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Deceiving title.  No different than any other modern guitar book.", "text": "The far, far majority of rock musicians have always been male.  I honestly have no idea why, but that's the hard truth.  As a result, few companies ever bothered to market something specifically for female musicians.  However, by the mid-1990s a significant number of guitar-driven bands with one or more female musicians had made waves on the scene (White Zombie, The Breeders, Veruca Salt, Smashing Pumpkins, Jewel, Hole, Cheryl Crow, etc.).  And today, a higher percentage of women can be seen in the local music scenes and even in working in musical instrument stores.<br /><br />Tish Ciravolo took advantage of this new target audience and created Daisy Rock: a line of guitars and basses created for female musicians.  Not only are they made to look more \"girly\", but since women are physically different than men, the guitars also have a different contour in the body and the length is scaled smaller.  It was a smart move on Ciravolo's part, and one that was long overdue.  For women who want to start playing guitar or bass, I highly recommend checking these out.<br /><br />It was all because of Daisy Rock's success that Ciravolo was approached to write a guitar book.  Hence, \"Girl's Guitar Method\".  It's a guitar book/CD for beginners with some flowery graphics and...well, unfortunately that's about it.<br /><br />In and of itself, the book is a decent guitar lesson book.  It includes what you normally find in other guitar books: tablature readings, instructions on how to tune, construction of chords, a chord dictionary, and modern examples (\"alternative music\" and the like) to listen and play to, structured into lessons that start at the most basic level and get increasingly advanced.  But strip away the curvy fonts and other girly doodles, and you're left with a book that's really no different from the numerous other guitar books on the market today.  To me, that makes the title rather deceiving, especially to those just starting on the instrument.<br /><br />In all fairness, I don't see how one COULD write guitar lessons for women specifically.  It would be like trying to write a book called \"Men's Crochet Method\", by taking a random crochet book and putting Freddy Kreuger's sweater on the front cover, maybe an irrelevant centerfold inserted too.  Same book, just repackaged in order to market it to a new audience.  Unfortunately, \"Girl's Guitar Method\" is no different.  I'm sure some will blindly assume I'm a chauvinist and mark this review as \"not helpful\" just out of spite, but for those who value your playing more than fancy marketing, you may first want to check out some of the much more informative (and cheaper) guitar books out there.", "images": [], "asin": "0739029061", "parent_asin": "0739029061", "user_id": "AGTG2DYQZGC4ONNSPPK7CDITKQAQ", "timestamp": 1063688623000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": false}

This biography appears to have been written by a high school sophomore.  Tangled shoestrings of comments from Steve Jobs, plus those of the people who knew him, are juxtaposed with sudden references to \"I\" (e.g Jobs says he liked King Lear, and \"I asked him why he related to King Lear...\") If this is an interview, write it as such.  If it's a biography, as touted, then please remove yourself from it, oh, writer.  The sentences are stilted, forced, and lack any creativity.  A pure statement of facts--a facts sheet, if you will--would read more eloquently than this work of non-fiction.  As it stands now, \"Steve Jobs\" is a cobbled patchwork of facts with conjunctions and prepositional phrases thrown in to link them. It's downright painful to read.<br /><br />If one were unaware that this was a published biography, and merely read it under the misrepresentation that a high school student turned it in for their English class project, it would be both believable, and highly defensible. The wisdom of Steve Jobs is lost in the hands of this \"professional writer\", who casts a murky haze over the biography just as a death shroud obscures a corpse.  It is so poorly constructed, so rudimentary in its prose, that it can only come \"alive\" in television sound bites, where it barely breathes with gasping shallow respirations, as if it was a boat-landed carp.<br /><br />A powerful operatic aria for Mr. Jobs, the one all Apple fans long for, this work is not.<br /><br />Mr. Jobs accepted this biography, unreviewed and unedited.  Mr. Isaacson was given free reign.  This degree of candor is appreciated from Mr. Jobs.  But, God rest his soul, perhaps he should have asked for an advanced copy, if for no other reason than to have his own Apple marketing department perform life-saving surgery to repair it into something readable and intelligent.  It certainly would have made reading this 630 page doorstop more enjoyable.<br /><br />As it is now, the message of the genius, Jobs, is undecipherable in the apple sauce of this text.  It is quite concerning that the New York literati down at Simon & Schuster publishing house would allow this unedited drone into the print shop.

{"label": 1, "rating": 3.0, "title": "The Finale", "text": "Though there are certainly people who would argue otherwise, I have always considered the Kronos Chronicles to be a MG or middle-grade series.  (MG being on one end of the Young Adult spectrum.)  Not that the series was lacking in sophistication nor depth of character, but because the books were outstanding, and yet still appropriate for younger readers.<br /><br />In fact, in my opinion Marie Rutkoski is one of THE best MG authors.  She can tell a whomping good story; make it engaging for teens as well as adults, and that is indeed a rare talent.  And so I gave \"The Cabinet of Wonders\" 5-Stars.  And \"The Celestial Globe\" 4-Stars.<br /><br />But something happened with \"Jewel of Kalderash\".  I didn't have a problem with the ending being a bit rushed, but I did have a problem with the fact that I never re-connected with Petra.

I really loved reading about Stalin. Not that I approve, but its a crazy story, its bloody as hell.  I like factual history, don't call the bad guys bad guys, I can do that.<br />  So Conquest's version: It's too preachy, its too much of a Cold War diatribe.  Let Stalin's facts speak for themselves, don't give me opinions on how wrong it is to kill millions of your own people.  As a piece of Cold War propaganda, Communists are all evil people, or stupid, or worse, Like calling Russian theorists of the pre revolution period 'crackpots'.  Nice.  Let the audience know early; you think people are just dumb, brainwashed. How about the cruelty and ineptitude of the czarist regime?<br />  Tell the truth, that people REALLY believed they were doing good, they were trying to create a utopia.  Stalin, certainly his victims IN the party and their contemporaries believed in what they were doing.<br />  That said, Stalin IS a horribly cruel mass murderer. But let the reader understand the entire picture, why was Stalin the way he was?  Why were Russians so willing to kill 'class enemies'? American and western students especially need to understand why people joined Communists: growing up in an environment where children are taught \"Better listen to Mommy and don't talk to commies\". Because Communists are Evil People who are against freedom, hate God and all forms of decency are trying to conquer the world.  Liberals are 'pinko communist dupes'  Wow! But Mommy; Why would anybody BE a Communist? \"Brainwashing!\" \"Because There's some really Bad People out there!\"  Sure thing, if you really believe the world is divided into good and evil, and USA is automatically good.  You will NEVER understand the world and events in it that led to the present, and where the future might be going; if you're really that simple.  Maybe it's a good way to make children feel good.<br />  This is what makes history so important, that the worst crimes are always perpetrated by those who fervently believed that right was on their side.  I mean, for one example; Americans REALLY believed backing military junta of South Vietnam with 500,000 soldiers wasn't cruel insanity.  That firebombing North and South Vietnamese settlements were all part of being 'good guys'.<br /> When you call one side evil, stupid, wrong, and its thinkers 'crackpots' you're not writing history anymore.

Owen's however are normally character building and good story telling. In this book he's comic relief and side story filler. He does nothing to progress anything but get a pet.

A big fight with the world serpent is over in a few paragraphs, and even then it's mostly filler. The Hel battle, maybe 1-2 pages? Everything that was supposed to be building up to is forgettable. This is an absolute let down from what was hands down one of the best fantasy series in existence. Calling this book fanfiction is by no means a stretch.

Then it flows into what may seem the starting spot wherein the lead protagonist, Reve (short for Revelation, which is a family name) Maskalyne, kills her magician husband, Jeremy, when the gun she normally used for a magic trick is switched with a real loaded gun.<br /><br />There is a bit plasticity to these opening scenes and frankly, I was glad to be out of Vegas and in Five Corners and Hawley so the real story begins. The man who killed her husband is still stalking them so Reve returns to her hometown at the urging of her grandmother. She also takes back her maiden name of Dyer. It isn't just to camouflage herself and her daughters but also a return to a tradition of the Dyer women using their maiden names.<br /><br />I liked how Szarlan also brings in the viewpoints of the daughters (15 year old Grace and Faith along with ten year old Cayleigh) even though most of the book is told from first person narration of Reve.<br /><br />Once Reve and family are back in Five Corners, Reve begins to piece together her family legacy and how it may affect her. It also leads her back to her childhood friend and first love who is now the chief of police in Hawley. Not that Reve is fully ready for a romance so soon after losing her husband but the connection is there nonetheless.<br /><br />Interesting parts of the book is when Szarlan tantalizes with the use of magic but she also ups the tension with the addition of another murder of Reve's college friend many years prior. At first this addition seems tacked on but it actually does work later in the story.<br /><br />My issue with the story is that there just seems a little too much going on that. There were times when I'd get mixed up with the different Revelations. We never really get more of the Las Vegas situation. The main 'villain' never really feels like much of a threat. We know he's a problem early on but once we get to the revelation, it is thin and under-explained so I felt a let down at the end that I can't quite shake off.<br /><br />But again, the potential is there for a solid series. More use of American history and folklore and how the Dyer line figures into it. More development for the daughters who also have magic in them. Just more development for all the characters as Reve digs more into her legacy and the town(s) as well.", "images": [], "asin": "0345545028", "parent_asin": "0345545028", "user_id": "AGSP6LSQK32SQEJO3YVVNACPWMSQ", "timestamp": 1410732612000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": -1, "rating": 1.0, "title": "The Adolescent Angst of Suburban Boys Who Wanna Be Gangsta", "text": "It's not clear to me what the point of this book is. For a number of years I worked at a small alternative store. Some of the people who frequented the shop identified as punk. The difference between street kids who created their own punk style and the suburban kids who bought their style at Hot Topics in the mall was glaringly obvious. Similarly, every fall my town hosts one of the larger biker gatherings in the U.S. The difference between hard core outlaw bikers and the accountants/doctors/dentists who ride their &#34;hogs&#34; on weekends to pretend they are outlaw is equally glaring. Guthrie, Dylan, and the author were not poor or working class. They all came from comfortable money with Guthrie and Dylan both posing as something they were not. To his credit, Guthrie tried to live the life he sang about. He actually joined the struggle to change things and stayed with it throughout his life until his illness stopped him. Dylan, on the other hand, seems to have consciously decided early on to stay away from any real political involvement. So he appears to be a strange choice to illuminate our political history and the very real anger which grows out of it. That's why it seems to me that this book is really about the angst of two teenage boys, the author's, in his suburban childhood and Dylan's in his younger days. Real adult anger, in the sense this book tries but fails to convey, would not only rail against injustice but would also do something about it, preferably over the long haul.<br /><br />If you want to see what genuine political anger looks like, I would suggest two books to start. The first would be Naomi Klein's &#34;The Shock Doctrine&#34; which will give you the brutally ugly history of the United States from the 1950's to the present, a history that you rarely, if ever, hear in this country. As a side comment, I would note that Klein is also a dedicated activist who acts on her politics. The second book is Marge Piercy's &#34;City of Darkness, City of Light&#34; a searing novel about the French Revolution. She dissects with an angry scalpel how the king, the nobility, the liberal middle class, and the radicals all squabbled and bickered among themselves for power while the working class and the poor went hungry again and again. I would also have to comment that while I know nothing of Piercy's personal life, a number of her novels are very political, burning with anger, with vision, and with hope.<br /><br />There are several other things to add about Daniel Wolff's book. He ends on some grim notes. Guthrie's activism wound down in the 1950's while McCarthyism was raging full force. The last chapter of the book details the harsh economic realities of our times - the collapse of the union movement as well as the growing poverty and income inequality. There are some key things his angst misses though. First, it's clear now that political change in this country moves in waves. There are periods of intense activism as well as lulls and/or times of repression. Second, even with that ebbing and flowing, it's also clear that real change has been happening. Slavery, women as chattel, and child labor are all gone, after some hard fought, long drawn out battles. There is still much, much that has to be done but there have been real improvements for women, for children, for people of color, and for our LGBTQ communities.Finally, as grim as things are economically and politically right now, the core truth of today is that we are at a significant crossroads for all of humanity. The climate change clock is ticking, whatever climate deniers wish to believe. We either change things now or we destroy the earth's systems that sustain human life. Daniel Wolff does not even begin to address that reality in this book. Even so, that's where the real grown up anger of today needs to be focused and needs to be actually doing something.<br /><br />P.S.

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Night World No. 2", "text": "This is a combination of my individual reviews for Night World 4: Dark Angel, Night World 5: The Chosen, and Night World 6: Soulmate.<br /><br />I would give this collection a 3-3.5 out of 5. Smith continues her Night World series with Gillian and a guardian angel, Rashel the vampire-hunter with a vampire soulmate, and Hannah and Thierry, the original soulmates.<br /><br />===<br /><br />Night World #4: Dark Angel, by L. J. Smith<br /><br />At first \"Dark Angel\" doesn't seem like a typical Night World book. Gillian Lennox is a normal teenager; someone that many teen girls could probably relate too.  She's not one of the popular crowd but instead is a shy outcast. Her two goals in life are somewhat superficial: she wants to be popular, and she wants David Blackburn to love her. But then who wasn't superficial when they were a teen?<br /><br />Gillian's introduction to the Night World comes when she has a near death experience. On her way home from school, she goes into the snowy woods after she thinks she hears a child crying. Instead she falls into a creek and hypothermia sets in. But she's rescued by Angel, a celestial being who guides Gillian back to the road. But Angel turns out to be more than just a lifesaver, as he starts to help Gillian fulfill her goals. He whispers the secrets of popularity in her ear, helping a shy girl transform into a vivacious butterfly. But as Gillian's status increases at school, she starts to become suspicious of her guardian angel...who is he really? And what does he want with David?<br /><br />The Night World connection in this book is tenuous, but it does make sense. After all, in a world populated with werewolves, vampires, and other supernatural creatures, it's natural that spirits would exist as well. So far Gillian is probably the most identifiable of all the protagonists in the Night World books, as she's your everyday teenage girl who finds out that there's a secret world...and she's part of it. How many of us have wished for that? I know I have.<br /><br />For me, \"Dark Angel\" is a solid chapter in the Night World series, but it doesn't really stand out, but then it isn't bad either. It's a good story of growth.<br /><br />3/5.<br /><br />===<br /><br />Night World #5: The Chosen, by L. J. Smith<br /><br />When she's 5 years old, Rashel sees her mother and her friend killed by a vampire. The vampire tries to get her as well, but even at 5 she's strong enough to resist his mind control. Fast forward twelve years and Rashel is a vampire hunter, existing on the fringes of the Day and the Night worlds, keeping humans safe.<br /><br />Rashel is a very strong character, comfortable in her body and determined because of her past. She's a great fighter and has a sense of honor. When she and a group of vampire hunters capture a vampire, the others want to torture him, but Rashel can't stomach torturing a defenseless being, even if he is a vampire. So she decides to let him go...and then discovers he's her soulmate. To add to the mix, the vampire is Quinn, known throughout the Night World as one of the most soulless, human-hating vampires around.<br /><br />While Rashel is one of my favorite Night World characters, I find the plot of this book a little weak. Rashel stumbles into a Night World slave trade of humans when she rescues a blonde bunny, but then Daphne, the girl she helps, is willing to risk her life to help Rashel take down the operation. The ending is very abrupt as well, without taking care of some loose ends that I would've liked to see resolved. But overall \"The Chosen\" fits very nicely into the Night World series, and uses the soulmate principle that ties all the books together very nicely. Rashel and Quinn are iconic of the opposites attract cliche, but it works for them and they grow over the short time period of the book. I really want to see more of them.<br /><br />3/5.<br /><br />===<br /><br />Night World 6: Soulmate, by L. J. Smith<br /><br />Hannah Snow has the perfect life - she's about to graduate from high school, she already has a college scholarship, and she even knows that she wants to be a paleontologist. But her perfect life starts to collapse when she finds notes that she doesn't remember writing, warning her of a dire event - \"Dead Before Seventeen.\"<br /><br />Increasingly disturbed by the notes and bad dreams, Hannah visits a psychiatrist. On her very first appointment, a werewolf crashes into the building and tries to attack her, but a mysterious voice in her head helps her dodge each claw swipe. She's saved by the arrival of a second werewolf, who chases off the first.<br /><br />Knowing that she has to get to the root of what's going on, Hannah and the psychiatrist try hypnosis, and she's plunged into a vision of a past life, where she was Hana, and a strange boy with blood around his mouth appears in her village...<br /><br />Thierry is one of the oldest vampires in the world, created at the dawn of humanity. He's spent his lifetime searching for his soulmate, trying to find her before her 17th birthday so he can break a cycle of death. But when he finds her this time, she doesn't want his help...<br /><br />\"Soulmate\" is my favorite Night World book. Coming 6th in the series, it exemplifies the soulmate principle Smith has used in each previous book, because Hannah and Thierry are the original soulmates. Hannah's past lives are a great plot device, because it allows Smith to give her lots of growth and abilities; and I really enjoy the stories of her past lives. I wish Smith had done more with that, she alludes to some interesting incarnations of Hannah but only fills in a few. Like other Night World heroines, Hannah's no wilting flower and she does take matters into her own hands when she needs to. Also in \"Soulmate\" Smith starts to introduce a bigger theme if classic theme, saving the world, and it'll be interesting to see where she takes it.<br /><br />If you read any of the other in the Night World series, this book will also give a good update on what your favorite couples are up to, and what they are trying to do.<br /><br />4/5.", "images": [], "asin": "1416974512", "parent_asin": "1416974512", "user_id": "AFVV7CLXY43P3Z3F7SROBZATZVSQ", "timestamp": 1260157579000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

Why was she left by parents she knew so little about? She knew she had been a sick baby and that she had older siblings; did those reasons have something to do with it? Chung eventually tries to start a relationship with her biological family, finding kinship but also some negative developments that keep her at a distance from this new/old family.<br /><br />I love a book with short chapters. It helps make it more enjoyable and makes a quicker read. I read this for a book club and it is not something I would have picked on my own.

He also spends far too much time detailing the life and works of people composer Aaron Copland and blues artist Blind Willie McTell who aren't necessarily thought of as influences on Mr. Dylan's work, but that Mr. Wilentz makes the arguement that they really are.  That being said Mr. Wilentz is a long time fan of Mr. Dylan and he attended several famous Dylan concerts that he recalls in the book.

When I purchased this book, I wasn't sure if I'd keep it or hand it off to a friend with a new dog, but it's not useful for either of us.<br />First off, it's not a true guide book. There's ONE dog friendly hike listed per state. ONE. With almost no resources on how to find more. No mention of state specific trail finding sites/apps or even AllTrails. Did Jen even do her research or consider the needs of her audience?<br />She's doling out dog training advice like a trainer without being a trainer. She has no credentials to be doing so and should not be doing so. Giving advice on dog reactivity through a book, especially when you aren't a trainer, is dangerous and, frankly, quite stupid. And her advice for finding a trainer via social media and Google? Come ON. Anyone worth their salt would know to point people towards a site like IACP or another place where people can find trainers who have been reviewed by other trainers instead of by their Instagram and Facebook buddies. This is another thing that tells me she really doesn't know what she's talking about on the training front.<br />And then the minimal actual hiking advice... What about the info one needs for truly exploring the backcountry and not just the highly trafficked trails near home? What should folks do when they encounter a bull moose, mountain goat, or black bear with their dog? How about a group with a pack mule or a group of people on horseback? What's the etiquette around dirt bikes and ATVs? Where can we find rattlesnake aversion training and where is that necessary? How much more of an effect do my dogs have on wildlife off leash vs on leash and how should I make the choice to leash or not leash them based on where I am, even where there are no leash rules? These are all things I've encountered and had to consider while traveling with my dogs, and I'm not even an extreme traveler!<br />This book literally only skims the surface of a few topics and doesn't offer any worthwhile information on any of them. This is all info I can easily find for free online!<br />When you look at the acknowledgements, it's easy to tell WHY this book is trash.

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "A glum take on pedestrian issues in small town America suffering through post-9/11 disillusionment", "text": "Some times you pick up a book and a few chapters in your realize that it's just not for you.  It's dangerous to write such a review, because you expose yourself to the charge of, 'You just didn't get it, you cretin.'  I admit that both aspects of that statement may be true, but I didn't get Jonathan Dee's latest book, &#34;The Locals.&#34;<br /><br />Dee's latest novel takes on the American sense of untethered isolation in the wake of 9-11.  Using shifting perspectives that jump with alarming frequency - kind of like the evil demon in the Denzel Washington movie &#34;Fallen,&#34; who jumps from person to person with a tap on the shoulder, the novel's perspective jumps quickly from character to character - Dee gets inside the lives of a bunch of small town Massachusetts residents.  And everyone is more or less unhappy, bitter, and irritated with everyone else.<br /><br />The opening chapter - essentially a prologue - sets the tone.  The narrator for this chapter is a young jerk looking to benefit from a class action lawsuit while covering up his legal issues arising from his . . . indiscretions.  What becomes clear is that, even though he is in Manhattan hours after the 9/11 attacks, he couldn't care less - he's just out for himself and he sees everyone else in the world as a waste of space.  This sets an unsettling tone for the rest of the book, which I suppose is more or less the point.<br /><br />The 'hero' of this story, Mark Firth, bumps into the prologue narrator as he is also looking to get some money from the class action lawsuit - a bunch of folks have been victimized by a complex swindle.  A contractor in Howland, Massachusetts, Mark has bungled his family's finances, and while everyone back home is initially elated that he survived 9/11, Mark is all too aware of his family's precarious financial straits.  But he finds a potential windfall when an eccentric millionaire moves to town and hires Mark to do a bunch of seemingly needless work at his home.<br /><br />I'll leave further plot details to others and for you to discover, but the overall point of the story is that life in Howland is rather unpleasant.  The town is not thriving, and people seem motivated more by jealousy and frustration than anything else.  The plot - involving development and small-town politics - moves so slowly that it is secondary to both character and setting.  And neither the characters nor the setting ever become all that interesting.  Again, perhaps this is me, but if I want to hear about petty jealousies and frustrations, I can see plenty of those in my daily life.  There is nothing in this book that takes these petty issues to a more interesting place or puts a sufficiently comic spin on them to make &#34;The Locals&#34; that interesting.<br /><br />Dee is a respected writer, so this review probably says more about me than about him.  But for me, &#34;The Locals&#34; ends with a whimper, but I really liked the ending.", "images": [], "asin": "0812993225", "parent_asin": "0812993225", "user_id": "AE64KJRO3QOHPHK47RHSD4LDELHQ", "timestamp": 1503582883975, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

Ideal for those who love weaponry, high-tech spyware, and black-ops combat. The authors certainly love their acronyms. The glossary placed at the end of the book should be at the beginning. There is some attempt here to explore a few characters in a little depth and examine some geopolitical insights. But it doesn't really work well. This is fundamentally a good guys versus bad guys shoot-em-up story, with a little who-does-what-to-who spy mystery included. The protagonist is very hard to figure out. Partly, an old follow-orders soldier with no personal life, partly a crusader trying to rescue the damsel in distress, part super-heroic combat leader. The combat action is the star here. Lots of unreal elements found. The key agency has unlimited budget, equipment, resources, tech, weapons, etc. Yet remains completely secret from everyone in the US Government (except for one man) including all the other spy agencies and military branches. And all the other spy agencies in the world (except one) are completely oblivious to and uninvolved in the major events portrayed. And of course, the key bad guys decide to get together in person and discuss their complete plan in detail just before execution. The action writing is very good.

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Not the scheming witch so many writers have made her appear to have been", "text": "This story definitely made a more sympathetic character out of Elizabeth Woodville than most writers I have encountered.  She was, in fact, downright likable throughout most of the novel, in spite of the hocus-pocus witchcraft storyline.  And while I did not like Gregory's The Red Queen and have not ever cared for Margaret Beaufort, it was interesting to see how the author switched gears rather believably in her portrayal of Henry VII's mother between her own novel (The Red Queen) and this one.  I appreciated that the witchcraft, while alluded to in the initial encounter between Edward and Elizabeth, was not given any weight when it came to the love and relationship between the two of them. I am normally a stickler for reading a series in order, but in the case of this one, it did not really make a difference (partly due to my extensive familiarity with the characters from other texts).  If you omit The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter, the other four are pleasantly enjoyable -- enough character development to make the characters believable, and Gregory gets her historical details right when it really matters, as well as keeping  the &#34;bodice-ripper&#34; content of these to a blessedly lesser degree than I have run across in some of her other works.", "images": [], "asin": "1416563695", "parent_asin": "1416563695", "user_id": "AE2QCQ452USRFX2M523MLSQKCMDQ", "timestamp": 1430247044000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Challenging Read, Would Benefit from Illustrations", "text": "If you are looking for a Mars colonization story that covers every aspect of what such an endeavor might look like, down to the level of finest detail, this is the trilogy for you. Everything is described, including but not limited to: the tools used for building and fixing various elements; how the colonists shower; chemical compounds they have to manufacture to create concrete and other materials; and a healthy dose of love interests and \"office politics\". It doesn't quite fit the mode of a \"Space Opera,\" but it is ambitious in what it attempts to convey, both on the level of world building and human interaction.<br /><br />That said, it's a challenging read because the work-up to the main conflict and action takes time. It's fair to say the story would've benefitted from a more aggressive editor, cutting back on some of the exposition and every day dialog. The author wants us to know what it would literally be like to live and work on Mars with a collection of strong personalities, but the truth is as readers, it's better to be spared some of the more mundane or tiresome details. Making a work of fiction too much like real life, is not necessarily a virtue.<br /><br />What would also benefit the story are a few well-placed illustrations or line drawings, showing us (instead of telling us) what some of the complex habitats, rovers, and other components actually looked like. It can be difficult to actually picture the things the author talks about at points. In fact, at points I felt this work might be better experienced as a trilogy of 2-3 hour movies or an HBO mini-series, marrying the detailed story with some impressive visuals.<br /><br />Overall the quality of story-telling is good but I've rated this three stars for the amount of effort required to get through, and the lack of visuals where warranted.", "images": [], "asin": "0593358821", "parent_asin": "0593358821", "user_id": "AGCCJEVXZ7PWASGPWAP4I4ZAMEAA", "timestamp": 1664377321931, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

My conundrum:<br /><br />Positives:<br />- The story is quite plot-driven, making it an interesting read. The book is set up by tour stop, moving from LA to the New York eventually<br />- The relationship between Jonny, and his mother, Jane, seems to be what I'd imagine it to be when a parent has taken control of their child's career. She wants to the best for him, but she also wants the best for her business... which just so happens to be her child...<br />- Getting into Jonny's psyche and seeing his struggle between wanting fame and a regular childhood makes him a very sympathetic character. You have to wonder how many of these poor child stars are absolutely miserable and feel forced into their insane schedules.<br />- My favorite character was definitely the bodyguard Walter, the most down-to-earth character in the novel. He genuinely cared for Jonny, protecting him from dangers and trying to give him some tidbits of normalcy.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- I thought the \"find my father\" subplot was weakly developed.<br />- The book lacks the depth it could have; at times I thought this on-the-surface aspect was actually a trick, that the reader had to look further to really see the depth. And all I came up with was poor little rich pop singer kid who doesn't know his dad, may want a chance at a regular life, and has a mom with some serious issues. I can get that in an E!

The information is comprehensive and serves well as a good reference source about things of the country you may not find in a wikipedia. It focuses on the different ethnic groups in Puerto Rico, and on its customs and traditions (e.g. dance, music, folklore, etc.). The language is accessible for 4th to 6th graders. The book is quite informative, but it is not meant to be an in-depth study of a culture. It is merely an introduction to it.<br /><br />However, in spite of its encyclopedic approach, there are minor setbacks. I don't think that Puerto Rican historians were consulted. The text says on page 9 that Puerto Rico obtained its independence from Spain. Such thing never happened. There is a serious omission on black slavery, only mentioned in a couple of lines. And although I'm aware that this book is not meant to give a deep coverage on history, the editors strolled through important events, such as the Spanish-American War, the Foraker Act, and the Jones Act, this latter law, which gave Puerto Ricans American citizenship. Next, carelessness is noted when the editors claim that the Protestant Church in PR split in other sects such as Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons. These two religions were never offshoots of Protestant Churches. I use it in the classroom to teach reading comprehension skills using culturally relevant material, but I have to do my own research to ensure that the content is accurate.
