{"rating": 4, "title": "Authentic, vivid, and heartbreaking", "text": "I am, perhaps unsurprisingly, a very big fan of Cormac McCarthy's western novels.  And horses.  After my acquaintance with both, I can say with no reservations that the way Hagy writes horses and the west is authentic and vivid.  While Will Testerman occupies many more pages of narrative than the horse of the title does, Boleto (or \"Ticket\") is by far the most tangibly drawn character in the book, and not just because we know what color she is.<br /><br />I was strongly reminded of McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679744398 All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, Book 1)]] in many ways, but Hagy has her own voice.  Testerman is in many ways an admirable character and a pleasure to read about.  Even if he does live under a sense of constant failure, he has a real heart for serving others, even when it's difficult.  The themes of the human-horse relationship and betrayal were powerful ones, and used well.  At a crucial point in the story (won't spoil it), I felt my stomach drop along with Will's, and I very nearly cried at the book's conclusion.<br /><br />Perhaps the only thing I can say negative about the novel - and it's no small thing - is the gratuitous sex (and extremely gratuitous, vulgar descriptions) throughout.  When reading McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679760849 The Crossing (The Border Trilogy, Book 2)]] in class years ago, a classmate said \"This isn't realistic at all - he doesn't have sex!\"  Well, Testerman certainly makes up for Billy Parham's celibacy.  I don't expect Testerman to abstain from all female contact - but the explicit and unnecessary descriptions of his many, many encounters, while they didn't completely ruin the book for me, made me decide against keeping it.  I can't ever imagine wanting to reread those passages again.<br /><br />I'd love to read some of Hagy's other work - this book has certainly given me a taste for it.

{"rating": 3, "title": "I ran out right away.....", "text": "to buy this book, as two of the author's others: The Sensualist and The Tattooed Map are two of my alltime favorite books.  Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. This is the story of Hippolyte, to me an annoying, unlikeable and dirty smelly explorer type (hmmm...the heroine in The Tattooed Map was also none too clean..)who sets out to find some islands that supposedly do not exist. Sounds like a good story, right? Well, it would have been, except that the bulk of the story consists of Hippolyte trying to convince his editor that his journey was fact and not fiction, as she believes. This is done mostly through letters and notes of historical facts sent back and forth. The &quot;finding the islands&quot; part was way too small, and the rest of the book was sooo boring that any mystery etc. regarding these islands is overshadowed by the simple fact that I didn't want to read on. Also, there is some kind of completely unbelievable romance type thing beginning between Hippolyte and his editor Marie that begins to make the book a little bit more interesting, but it never fully develops into anything. Because I paid full price for this book, I forced myself to finish it. I must say that the illustrations did distract from the boredom of the continuous facts and figures in the book, thus raising it's rating from two to three stars.  All in all, I was sorely disappointed, especially since I was so looking forward to another novel by this, one of my favorite authors.", "images": [], "asin": "0811828921", "parent_asin": "0811828921", "user_id": "AEGL7446XAOD25OQW6GT7CIRP7WQ", "timestamp": 1002208618000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

Mick was a famous singer who fell in love with June, the daughter of The Costas who owned fish & chips joint in town in 1956.  Through flashbacks we learn much about their rocky relationship and life together how it affected the lives of their four children through the lead up of the big end-of-summer bash on August 27, 1983, that gets out of control and ends in disaster.<br /><br />A love a good family saga and think this one has that feel. This is definitely a character driven story and the author does a great job letting the reader get to know each of the Riva siblings and to and lesser degree, parents June and Mick. I loved the strong sibling ties. By far, Nina was my favorite character, a gorgeous model, fabulous surfer but someone who with a sense of responsibility to others and someone who  put the needs of others above her own. I liked June and Riva's story and that invincible feeling when young and in love that sometimes makes one overlook the obvious. I liked the Malibu beach scene and the 1980s vibes: the sun, the surf, the music and the fancy free lifestyle. My least favorite aspects of this story was the details of the rich and entitled party attendees who seemed to do everything in excess. There was plenty of booze, drugs and sex in this novel as well. Overall I liked this story even though some parts were overdone.<br /><br />This is my second novel by this author, Daisy Jones and the Six was my first and one I enjoyed.  I gather that Mick Riva was one of the husbands in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo but I haven't read that one yet.<br /><br />RATING:  4/5<br /><br />Thanks go to Random House Audio for allowing me access to this book in exchange for my unbiased review.

But, there's always that one things that hold it back.  And really, for me a 3 isn't a bad rating.  It's just that I think there are better books out there.<br /><br />I felt like I didn't really connect with Will.  At times, I felt like his character was all over the place.  Granted with the tragedy in his past, I kind of understand.  Especially when you factor in the idea that he has no idea what happened.  He also has a lot on his plate dealing with his best friend, Gretchen.  Her sleepwalking habits often left me agitated.  Her obsession with Asia also felt forced.  She just sort of shows up in town and he can't help but wonder about her.  I also wanted to him to wake up and see what his obsession was doing to Gretchen.<br /><br /> I really did enjoy the mermaid/siren folklore in this story.  It includes the story of Calypso, and her obsession with Odysseus.  When he left her, she was overcome with need for revenge.  It was an interesting twist to the story.  I enjoyed Asia's connections with Calypso and what she's required to do.<br /><br />For some reason, I found the overall story extremely slow moving.  It felt like there was hardly any action to drive the story forward.  It wasn't until Asia tells Will the complete story of who and what she is that the story felt like it was going anywhere.  And then it was over.

{"rating": 4, "title": "3.5-4 stars: Good Overall; One Dud in the Mix", "text": "Traditional Regency anthology. Note: Traditional Regency means no sexytimes (well, except Mary Balogh's - see below).<br /><br />** \"Under the Kissing Bough\" by Sandra Heath - 2.5-3 stars. Pretty standard Regency fare. Country gentry down on their luck has to move out of their manor home into a cottage. The new owner is a London gentleman who spots one of the daughters when she sneaks onto the estate to collect some greenery to use as Christmas decorations. He takes an immediate interest in her and asks for her help in decorating the manor home for the holidays. Really, no big surprises, no complex characters. Possibly the most interesting character is the villainess, with whom the H, Sir Philip, was once in love.<br /><br />** \"Season of Joy\" by Gayle Buck - 3 stars. Sweet second chance romance/engagement story. A betrothed couple have a misunderstanding when H spots h hugging her longtime MALE best friend before said best friend heads off to the Peninsula to fight in the war. They have a confrontation, and H storms off and decides to join the fighting on the Peninsula, as well (it's not written as hotheaded as it sounds). He writes a letter to h that essentially gives her the okay to jilt him. Instead, she writes him back, and they thus begin a correspondence over the year. Story picks back up when it's Christmas Eve, and H returns to h's family's estate. I would say 3.5-ish, but the last line is definitely a 1-star hokey *cringe*-worthy mess. I know that sounds judgmental, but seriously, when these stories are so short, every paragraph counts.<br /><br />** \"The Viscount and the Hoyden\" by Laura Matthews - 2 stars. I read this story once, years ago. Came away with a bland and blah feeling that henceforth has made me skip this story every year when I bring this anthology out to reread around the holidays. Viscount's mother used to visit somewhere out in the country every year and would come back to tell him stories of this young hoydenish girl. He was enchanted by these tales and envious of her carefree upbringing (he was an only child, if I remember correctly). He visits the country estate with the idea of wooing her. Pretty meh overall. Definitely skippable, in my eyes.<br /><br />** \"The Christmas Mouse\" by Emily Hendrickson - 4 stars. I really really liked this one. It's a sweet story about a young woman who has unexpectedly inherited a country \"cottage.\" Only when she goes to the cottage, she sees it's actually an estate. With a manor house. And hundreds of acres of land. And tenant cottages. Oh, and a handsome estate manager by the name of Charles Dane. *wiggles eyebrows*<br /><br />Amanda, who had up til then been living with her brother and his wife as their unofficial (and unpaid) governess/nanny/tutor/poor relation, has always been retiring in her ways and quite shy around men, so she's quite pleased with the ease with which she can converse and keep company with Mr. Dane. Not only does this story present a sweet wallflower/beta romance, but it also is a bit of a coming of age story as Amanda learns to assert herself a bit and go after what she wants. The central conflict arises when Charlie realizes Amanda is quite an heiress, and he doesn't want her to think he's some kind of fortune hunter.<br /><br />** \"No Room at the Inn\" by Mary Balogh - 3.5 stars. A good story with a cast of characters that are stranded at an inn in a snow/ice/winter storm. A poor couple is also seeking shelter at the inn - in the stables, at that. She's pregnant, and the main action revolves around her going into labor.<br /><br />There are two couples whose romances are featured in this story: (1) an aristocratic married couple on their way to a house party and (2) a rakish marquess on his way to a debaucherous house party and a governess on her way to visit her family. The married couple has been unhappily married for three years, but each loves the other (if only they knew it). He thinks she doesn't need him and is happier with her ton friends than with his own company, while she has tried to be independent all this time because she hasn't wanted to be a burden on him, etc. She knows he keeps a mistress and doesn't understand why he brings his love to another; he keeps said mistress because he doesn't want to subject his wife to his base needs, etc. Basically, false assumptions have nudged them apart over the years until they just can't confront each other or put a finger on what exactly is wrong. I'm not explaining this well, but I really liked this couple. As you'd expect from Mary Balogh, she actually has a love scene in her short story between this couple...it's passionate and emotional. Very well done.<br /><br />What drags this story down is the second couple - the more traditional Regency-type relationship of a rake and a governess. I just found this couple flat out unbelievable. There's too much going on in the narrative for us to get any handle on either of their POVs for why they would fall in love with each other after being stranded together for two days. I think this story would have been much better served if it only focused on the married couple.", "images": [], "asin": "B001PDCXG0", "parent_asin": "B001PDCXG0", "user_id": "AGD3PVY57W5FHFD76WDZLNWNJFHQ", "timestamp": 1322770849000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 5, "title": "The Man Who Flies With Birds.", "text": "I am a Canada Geese fanatic, in fact, I wrote an article about them believing they should run the country! With this fascination, I went to my library to find more information about these magical creatures only to find there were no books on the subject (in my library). The Librarian kindly sent me to other books regarding birds and I found The Man Who Flies With Birds in the children's department. I thought it looked interesting and today, started to read it. I couldn't put it down - not since Harry Potter, another supposedly children's book, has anything grabbed my attention. Exquisite photography indeed and the written words were poetic in their scientific genre (don't you hate that word - just couldn't of another one). I was so entranced that I couldn't stop talking about it to my other half - every time I read a paragraph, I had something else to say. He is not a book reader - more of intelligent magazines and The Irish Times - so it was with some amazement that he agreed to take a look. HOOKED! I am ordering it now from Amazon - where else? - so I can have it in my possession before I return the copy I have to the library. I am not even into aviation, have a phobia about birds but am almost hypnotised by them. I was having a conversation some years ago with a man who was interested in retaining my services for a very prestigious conference when three Bald Eagles flew over the lake where we were discussing the event. For as long as the Eagles were there, I was transfixed. He talked - I didn't hear a word. This is exactly how I felt after the very first page of The Man Who Flies With Birds. Exciting, informative, unique and courageous. Not only that, this book and the work researched, saves lives. It is so topical with recent events of crashes due to birds flying into planes. I am always entranced with creativity and this is beyond the norm. Yossi Leshem is a genius. Whilst writing this, my 'to be' 9 year old grandson is to have his birthday in February so I believe I am to purchase two copies - he isn't getting mine. This is a forever in my library book. I am in my 80th year - obviously this book crosses the age perimetres. So, mind the gap and buy the book. I am going to recommend it to my family in the UK and Ireland. They have Amazon there too. Really, I just can't get over this book. Did I give you that impression? It's sensational - really. Would I lie to the great Amazon public.

Yes, a dog.<br /><br />I have to admit, when I realized that the main character in the book was Enzo the dog, and that it all takes place from his point of view, I wondered if the story would really maintain my interest.  I needn\u2019t have worried.  It did!<br /><br />Enzo is a philosopher with a worldview shaped by lots of TV, movies about car racing and the love and protection of his owner, Denny.  (The love and protection is definitely reciprocated!)  Enzo is both na\u00efve and wise and hoping in his next life to be a human with the ability to speak and to use opposable thumbs.  After living inside Enzo\u2019s head, I think he\u2019s ready.  I think he should graduate.  He\u2019d be a human I\u2019d like to know.<br /><br />There were so many quotable quotes in this book, so many bits of philosophy that I just loved.  Here\u2019s one of my favorites:<br /><br />\u201cBut my thoughts turned to what [Denny] had just taught me.  Such a simple concept, yet so true:  that which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our destiny.  Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.\u201d<br /><br />I\u2019m torn with whether to call this book a pleasant read.  I somehow don\u2019t think \u201cpleasant\u201d applies as there are some really tough times that Denny and Enzo go through.  On the other hand, as I finished the book and tried to think what to say about it, I was steeped in satisfaction with the arc of the story and I will miss Enzo.  I want to drop my hand toward the floor and feel him nuzzle it.  So maybe pleasant is the right word.<br /><br />Kudos to the author for making me care so much about the \u201cpeople\u201d in this story \u2013 and yes, I include Enzo in that term.

Boston is very historic, enlightening, and a worldly city. The book is done well but it can be done better for those of us who would like to know Boston and it's neighborhood.<br /><br />Boston has attracted all kinds of people like Julia Child who is missing from the text. She was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I wished that she was written more about here. She remained in Cambridge for decades even with the success of her shows and books. Cambridge has also attracted actor John Malkovich as well in recent years as well as other famous and notable residents. In Julia's book, she decided with her husband to settle in Cambridge after they returned from Europe. I wished the book would have acknowledged Julia Child's contributions to American cuisine, television history, and American culture.<br /><br />I also wished the book mentioned Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts as well but it doesn't. There are lot of important facts and information about Boston that isn't here. I loved the film section about what films in recent years especially \"The Fighter\" in Lowell and other notable films.<br /><br />I liked the book's acknowledgement of cemeteries where famous Americans such as Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and others have been interred. Boston is about American history as well as about sports. I visited Boston when Ted William died around 4th of July and he was honored with the flag at half staff at the Capital building. He was an American baseball legend and a beloved Boston Red Sox player.<br /><br />We stayed at a Doubletree hotel near JFK/Massachusetts General area.

{"rating": 4, "title": "This one pays beautiful homage to the Alice Network.", "text": "What I Didn\u2019t Like:<br />-Charlie\u2019s chapters. They felt almost repetitive and unnecessarily fluffy. I suppose they exist mostly to break up the heaviness of the topics addressed in the rest of the book, which is important, but they just don\u2019t give the same sense of urgency and excitement as Eve\u2019s chapters.<br />-The math \u201cequations\u201d forced on everything. As an actual math geek myself, I can say it\u2019s incredibly unlikely you\u2019ll find us making statements like \u201cme plus him minus morals equals \u2026\u201d. We tend to feel operations have weight and value, meaning we\u2019re less likely to throw them around in ways they weren\u2019t intended for. But maybe that\u2019s just me. Either way, it annoyed me that Charlie kept doing this.<br />-The ending. If you\u2019ve been following my reviews for a while you know I\u2019m the kind of reader who likes endings that don\u2019t lay it all out for me and instead keep me thinking and guessing long after I finish the book. I realize I\u2019m in the minority there. That being said, this final chapter (epilogue) felt unnecessary to me.<br /><br />What I Did Like:<br />-The historical research involved in this one added a wonderful sense of accuracy that this tale needed. The Alice network was real. Many of the women mentioned are based on real people and their real stories. This was an excellent retelling of their challenge, specifically Eve\u2019s chapters. This is 100% of the reason this book is recommended by so many people and passed around so frequently. It\u2019s an important part of history well researched and embedded.<br />-High tension. Eve\u2019s chapters ran with an intense sense of urgency that kept my interest and kept the story moving. I felt myself pulled to continue reading just to find out what happened next. She was captivating and compelling right from the first scene she popped into.<br />-The romance side storyline worked. I don\u2019t always say that and I definitely don\u2019t think it was entirely necessary (not every story needs a romance) but this one works. It\u2019s believable and it works for this story.<br /><br />Who Should Read This One:<br />-Historical fiction fans, specifically those who want something different from WWI or WWII fiction that already exists. This emphasis on the Alice Network makes this one refreshingly different from the rest of the offerings out there.<br /><br />My Rating: 4 Stars<br />Solidly researched historical fiction makes me happy.", "images": [], "asin": "B01LZFL63S", "parent_asin": "B01LZFL63S", "user_id": "AG662FMJFCYUSYQUBY4ZBYXHVBZQ", "timestamp": 1658782215535, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 4, "title": "One of my favorite reads this year", "text": "4.5 stars<br />I thought this book was a breath of fresh air as it's not the type of story I necessarily get to read very often. In some ways it is such a simple story but because the characters are complex as is their relationship, it just somehow works in an absolutely beautiful way.  I'm left feeling like this was just one of those good, rewarding reading experiences that only happens every once in awhile.<br /><br />Connell is smart, popular, and a football star at his high school.  Marianne is also smart but doesn't have any friends at school and gets picked on for her appearance as well as being labeled a mental case. Connell's mother cleans houses for a living and Marianne's family is one of her clients.  Connell often picks his mom up from work and that is how he gets to know Marianne better and develop an interesting connection to her.  But he definitely doesn't want the kids at school to know he has feelings for the outcast so he doesn't acknowledge Marianne at school or any other time except when they are alone.  And Marianne is okay with this.  The story alternates between the perspectives of Connell and Marianne and follows them over the course of a few years.<br /><br />Fair warning, Sally Rooney does not use quotation marks in her writing so if you think that might bother you when reading dialogue, maybe give this book a pass.  Personally, even though I don't see this writing technique used very often, it doesn't take me very long to adjust and get used to it.<br /><br />I read the author's other book, Conversations with Friends, a few years ago and enjoyed it but I liked this one even more.  Part of that can be due to the fact the characters in this book were far more likable, especially Marianne.  She is somebody who you wanted to be happy and you hurt when she hurt.  There is just something about these characters and their relationship that just spoke to me.  I really can't put it into words.<br /><br />I do recommend checking this one out but I will freely admit it's the type of book that you will either think is special or you will be left wondering why was there was so much hype.  As readers we bring our life experiences into every book we read so it makes sense we might not all gravitate towards the same stories. I personally loved this one though and am thankful I read it.

{"rating": 5, "title": "From a Gliderman's Viewpoint", "text": "There are not many \"first-hand accounts\" of the glider troopers in World War II but Fighting With The Screaming Eagles goes a long way to fill that void.<br /><br />Robert Bowen has as easy, natural style, which brings to light many of the unique challenges facing the glider forces.  First, they were not volunteers but were expected to perform at the same high combat level as paratroopers.  And that they did!<br /><br />Second, they were delivered into combat in light, vulnerable, plywood gliders in a controlled crash landing that was considerably more dangerous than a parachute jump.  They didn't receive their special insignia and hazardous duty pay until July 1944.<br /><br />Bowen pulls no punches as he takes the reader through the rough training, the Atlantic crossing and how the 401st stubbornly clung to its unit identity after being assigned as the 1st Battalion of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR) of the 101st Airborne Division.  From there, his unit was in reserve to the 4th Infantry Division coming ashore on Utah Beach and the harrowing glider landings in Operation Market-Garden before being rushed to the Ardennes on the battle of the Bulge where Bowen was captured.<br /><br />His unique perspective as both a glider warrior and a POW make this book extremely interesting and informative.  Pictures, maps, a robust bibliography and a Roll of Honor for Company C, 401st round out this extraordinary book.<br /><br />Anyone interested in airborne operations in Word War II will love this book.<br /><br />John E.

The Redwall elders are unusually harsh, particularly in the beginning of the book.  Their characters seem very flat, and any changes in their actions don't seem believable.  While I can accept the most overly-convenient events in a story I'm already suspending disbelief for, the badgers Salixa and Tabura came out of nowhere to fix Gorath's Bloodwrath.  Salixa in particular was ridiculously two-dimensional.  She was described as &#34;slender&#34; and &#34;gentle&#34; far too often to not be repetitive.  I felt like I'd fallen into a random love story that just happened to have an adventure and badgers.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, and I certainly wouldn't steer younger or dedicated readers away from Eulalia.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Worth every Galleon!", "text": "[[VIDEOID:2f366ad0920763d3bfcf2570a5c9d882]] I pre-ordered this for myself months ago. These are hands down the most beautiful and artistic versions of the Harry Potter book series. The quality is exceptional. I have three copies of the series (my old books from initial release, the complete red hardback copies with Hungarian horntail box, and now starting to collect these) and can confirm that these are truly the most elite version to date.<br /><br />Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima (MinaLima masterminds) created the graphic designs behind all the famous graphic elements of Harry Potter as seen in films. They created the famous letter from Hogwarts, the Marauders Map, Daily Prophet, the howler, the black family wallpaper, the wanted posters and so much more. I have grown up reading the books, watching the films and am beyond obsessed with the Wizard World. These books are so ornate and astonishing to someone who has reread the series multiple times, that it feels like I am reading the novels as a child for the first time. The book has several popup elements, beautiful color images, and more that make it such an interactive reading experience. From the high-quality hardback cover to each colored image, to the perfectly printed paragraphs, the work is phenomenal.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Beautiful Green Hardback cover with gold foil details<br />-Thick sturdy pages<br />-Pop out panels for a more interactive experience<br />-High resolution vibrant colors throughout<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Be mindful about the pop-up/interactive features around younger children, while this is very sturdy it can rip if mistreated.<br />-doesn\u2019t come in resealable plastic bag to protect it like the last book<br /><br />A few Important Spells (with Immaculate Illustrations) mentioned in this:<br />-Oculus Reparo<br />-Immobulus<br />-Fera Verto<br />-Finite Incantatem<br />-Expelliarmus<br />-Everte Statum<br />-Serpensortia<br />-Vipera Evanesca<br />-Wingardium Leviosa<br />-Cistem Aperio<br />-Arania Exumai<br />-Obliviate<br /><br />Overall: My videos and images do not do this justice! I would highly recommend this. I will be getting every version as it realizes on Amazon.

{"rating": 5, "title": "World's longest running 'Best of' horror anthology!", "text": "'Best New Horror' is now the longest running annual 'best of' horror anthology ever, beating the previous 22-volume record held for the past eighteen years by DAW Books for 'The Year's Best Horror Stories' (1971-1994). Although, in fairness to the industrious Ellen Datlow, she has - so far - edited an unbroken run of 25 annual 'best of' anthologies, twenty-one with St. Martin's Press and currently four with Night Shade Books. Of course, both have a ways to go yet to beat the mighty Gardner Dozois, who has edited a colossal 34 'best of' science fiction volumes since 1977, five with the publisher Dutton and, presently, twenty-nine editions of 'The Year's Best Science Fiction'.<br /><br />Last year 'Best New Horror' and Datlow's 'The Best Horror of the Year' overlapped by quite a few stories: this year none overlap. In fact, together with Paula Guran's 'The Year's Best Dark Fantasy & Horror', only one story is duplicated out of a total of 77, making this year a true embarrassment of riches.<br /><br />RAMSEY CAMPBELL leads off with \"Holding the Light\". Curiosity, a burning need to just know: the curse of youth, as young Tom and Lucas find out when they go exploring a local tunnel said to be haunted. As ever, Campbell's language is deceptively simple, the accumulative effect eerie, one of dread.<br /><br />Next up CHRISTOPHER FOWLER gives us a mischievous piece of whimsy, presented as the monologue of a patron of The Jack O'Lantern pub telling a new customer about the strange events that always seem to occur there throughout its history on All-Hallows Eve. Readers of Fowler's recent Hammer-homage horror novel 'Hell Train' will know just how delightfully sly he can be, and as with the best of tongue-in-cheek horror \"Lantern Jack\" still manages to give a nasty bite at the end.<br /><br />\"Rag and Bone\" by PAUL KANE is classic Best New Horror. I heard once that, with the overwhelming number of stories he has to consider each year, editor Jones will often read the first few pages then skip to the last few: if the story ends up going in the direction he thought it was then what's the point? After many decades in the business he wants to be surprised. So no surprise, then, he picked Kane as this story of a scrap merchant - a rag and bone man - doesn't finish up where you think it will.<br /><br />\"Some Kind of Light Shines from Your Face\" by GEMMA FILES is from the World Fantasy and British Fantasy Society Award-nominated 'Gutshot', an anthology of weird western stories edited by Conrad Williams. Western it certainly is, but it also involves Greek legends: a young woman joins two women in a travelling wagon, crossing the American dustbowl and scraping up a living by setting up tent and displaying their wares to grubby patrons eager to spend the little coin they have on catching a glimpse of the fair flesh and secret parts of comely women; to look on something fine to take their minds off their dry, barren existence. The women wear masks on stage, and when young Persia Leitner is eventually allowed to join them as well, a trinity is formed, and something happens... and old myths become new reality.<br /><br />\"Midnight Flight\" by JOEL LANE is, as the author himself says in the introduction, \"a story about the loss of memory, and how memory might not want to be lost.\" Concerning a man slowly recalling the title and details of a lost book from his childhood, whilst losing the identity of who he is now, the language very much recalls classic Ramsey Campbell in the author's claustrophobic depiction of misinterpretation and paranoia - and even manages to out-do Campbell in the closing page!<br /><br />\"But None Shall Sing for Me\" by GREGORY NICOLL is a piece of exotic horror set in the Caribbean and told from the point of view of a zombie. No, this isn't the knock about fun of Tim Powers' terrific `On Stranger Tides' novel, but an intense tale of closure and setting oneself free.<br /><br />Some of the best horror is the simplest, as demonstrated by ALISON LITTLEWOOD in \"About the Dark\". Three youths, Adam, Fuzz and Sasha, enter what is locally known as the Dark Cave. Through Sasha, we learn that there is a darkness in the cave, and not simply an absence of light. Many people have gone into the cave. Some never came back, their names written on the walls. Adam has recently started attending a new school, where he has reinvented himself from the bullied to a strong and disinterested figure who doesn't care about anything. Except he does. He cares about Sasha, but because of the newly created image of himself he doesn't show it and she goes with Fuzz instead, which annoys him greatly. Only once do all three enter the dark; thereafter Adam ventures alone and learns about the dark... and the names... and who puts them there. Understated, exact, and with an atmosphere that closes in on you. A frequent contributor to the UK's premiere horror fiction magazine, `Black Static' (wherein this story was first published; another story she had in the same magazine last year was reprinted by Ellen Datlow), Littlewood recently hit the UK bestseller lists with the publication of her well-received debut novel `A Cold Season'.<br /><br />In \"The Photographer's Tale\" by DANIEL MILLS Lowell's estranged apprentice, Patrick, sends him a camera. It's 1892 and this camera is the very latest model. It is also unique, as Lowell soon finds out. When looking through the lens it reveals not only what the subject will eventually look like in old age, but what secrets lie beneath their mask of make-up and outward personality. And once Lowell sees the truth, he sees it everywhere... even when no longer looking through the lens.<br /><br />\"The Tower\" by MARK SAMUELS comes from his collection `The Man Who Collected Machen and Other Weird Tales'. In this deceptively simple story a man, disillusioned with the modern commercial world and the vapidity of its future he envisions ahead, begins seeing a fog-enshrouded tower, where there shouldn't be any, in the middle of the city of London. A symbolism, he believes, for where he's trying to go, what he has to become. The power of this tale lies in the telling, and is on a par with the measured surrealism of Thomas Ligotti. Both write fresh horror, but imbued with the disciplined style of old masters like M.R. James, Robert Aickman, Algernon Blackwood and, of course, Arthur Machen. This is his seventh appearance in `Best New Horror' since volume 15.<br /><br />Last year's \"Christmas with the Dead\" by Joe R. Lansdale was Best New Horror's knock-about story; this year PETER ATKINS picks up that mantel in the delightful and snappily written \"Dancing Like we're Dumb\". It sees the return of his detective character, Kitty Donnelly, in a short, breezy tale of gangsters dabbling in the supernatural. It starts off with Kitty being carjacked and kidnapped: her day just gets worse from there on out!<br /><br />\"An Indelible Stain Upon the Sky\" by SIMON STRANTZAS is an emotionally complex story, allegorical, symbolic and thick with meaning and portent: Port McCarthy, once beautiful, is a damaged town, wrecked by an oil tanker spill. Our narrator and his wife Suzanne, once filled with hope and love, now stained like the town. Both fates - the town's and the couple's - are intricately entwined. Returning alone ten years after the town's accident to the inn they first stayed in, and the beginning of his wife's own descent, the narrator reflects on the crumbling of the past, seeing stains and shadows in the room and how his way of thinking, and what he said, came to infect his wife. The rich symbolism of the closing passages have a deep, ironic weight. This is horror of raw feelings, the writing delicately balanced, and being a tale of non-explicit horror it would not have looked out of place in this year's `The Best American Short Stories'.<br /><br />\"Hair\" by JOAN AIKEN comes from her posthumously published collection. Brief, but sharp, it tells of Tom keeping a promise to his recently deceased young wife to deliver a lock of her hair to her mother, whom he has never actually met before, his wife having been estranged from her for some time. An old woman, and very strange, Tom soon wishes he had still never met her.<br /><br />Echoes of Ramsey Campbell's influence can also be heard in the tight, dread-filled language of STEVE RASNIC TEM's \"Miri\", which marks his 16th appearance in Best New Horror. Here Rick finds his new life invaded by memories of a damaged and needy girl from his college days. Memories so tangible as to blur and make indistinct the reality he's currently trying to live in.<br /><br />\"Corbeaux Bay\" by GEETA ROOPNARINE is a short but effective story of a man who likes to get away from it all by exploring his local beach, where birds to whom he was cruel and dismissive in the past, now take a keen interest in him.<br /><br />\"Sad, Dark Thing\" by MICHAEL MARSHALL SMITH is from what was easily last year's best original horror anthology, ` A Book of Horrors' edited by Stephen Jones, which I've reviewed and where readers can find my thoughts on this story. As I said of a Smith story in a review of another Jones anthology from last year, `Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', everything Smith touches at short story length these days turns to gold.  As for this present story, suffice it to say here that it was also reprinted in `The Best British Short Stories 2012', a non-genre literary anthology.<br /><br />ROBERT SILVERBERG is easily the longest serving writer here: his first short story sale was in 1954 when he was eighteen-years-old - almost 60 years ago. Silverberg is a solid novelist, but a dazzling short story writer, as witness the recent massive retrospective from Subterranean Press, `Phases of the Moon: Stories from Six Decades' (2004), and as too witness this present story, \"Smithers and the Ghosts of the Thar\", published in what is now the author's seventh decade as a professional writer. Although Silverberg is indelibly associated with the science fiction genre, Jones has had occasion over the years to reprint his short stories in some of his themed anthologies, but this marks his first appearance in Best New Horror - and it's a welcome inclusion.<br /><br />Old masters such as M.R. James and Robert Aickman are talked of with reverence these days. Will REGGIE OLIVER one day be talked of that way? No, he already is. Oliver's contribution, \"Guieta Non Movere\", is actually lifted from his novella \"The Giacometti Crucifixion\" where it served as a story-within-a-story. That's how good Oliver is, when 'half' a story is so rich in language and storytelling that it can stand on its own.<br /><br />\"The Crawling Sky\" by JOE R. LANSDALE sees the return of the Reverend Jedidiah Mercer, who first appeared in the author's cult weird wild west novel 'Dead in the West' (1986), and in recent years in a series of short stories, one of which, \"Deadman's Road\", was included in Best New Horror 19. Lansdale has a voice soaked in the dialect of his East Texas home and his dialogue crackles with sun-lazy barbs and quips, his beloved landscape conjured with a few deft strokes of description. Here the Reverend finds himself in a spit of a little town called Wood Tick where, with shunned local Norville, he goes out to a ramshackle homestead to banish a 'haint' that is not of this world - and his doesn't do so with prayer and holy water!<br /><br />Together with Simon Strantzas, SIMON KURT UNSWORTH has clearly become a firm favourite of editor Stephen Jones, both having appeared four times now in the  past five volumes of Best New Horror. Here he gives us \"The Ocean Grand, North West Coast\" from his linked-collection of haunted dwellings, `Quiet Houses'. Mandeville, Parry and Yeoman form a restoration crew, and the Ocean Grand is their biggest project yet. Built at the turn of the last century and slowly neglected by a procession of changing owners over the decades, it has now lain derelict for 15 years. An ambitious design, a marriage of function and art, the concept of the hotel was to show the industrial design on the ground floor gradually changing into that of nature on the third floor. As the author himself says, \"[it's] about art created to be viewed, being alone, and going slowly claustrophobically mad.\"<br /><br />The multi-award winning EVANGELINE WALTON may have died in 1996, but here Jones presents us with \"They That Have Wings\", a 'lost' story of World War II in the great tradition of `Weird Tales' magazine.<br /><br />\"White Roses, Bloody Silk\" by rising star THANA NIVEAU is quite different from her contribution of last, \"The Pier\". This Victorian era tale of terror may start out slight and whimsical - but don't be fooled: a dinner party and a strange guest soon turns thorny. And bloody.<br /><br />\"Passing Through Peacehaven\" is RAMSEY CAMPBELL's second story in this year's volume (he is the only author to be twice given the honour of having two short stories reprinted within a given volume of Best New Horror). Next to Silverberg, Campbell is the second longest serving author in this current edition of Best New Horror, his first sale being in 1962 (indeed, he was only sixteen-years-old; even younger than Silverberg!). He is, without doubt, a giant of the horror field and this year marks his 50th anniversary as a writer. Finally, Best New Horror 23 ends with \"Holiday Home\" by DAVID BUCHAN, a piece of crime flash fiction.<br /><br />There are other fine stories, \"Wait\" by CONRAD WILLIAMS, which I reviewed last year under its original publication in 'Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', one of the best ghost anthologies in years. Prolific novelist and short story writer TIM LEBBON give us a \"Trick of the Light\", a sensitively handled tale from the extremely good and recommended 'House of Fear' edited by Jonathan Oliver (Datlow and Guran also picked stories from this anthology). Plus the author of the bestselling 'Let the Right One In' JOHN AJVIDE LINDQVIST's first short story, my review of which can be found under 'A Book of Horrors'. Six of that anthology's stories have now been reprinted, Ellen Datlow gave special citation to a further two stories in the opening paragraph of her Summation in 'The Best Horror of the Year: Volume Four', one other story has recently won an award and yet another story has been nominated for an award - making that 10 stories that have been 'named checked'; a quite remarkable achievement considering the anthology only contains fourteen stories in total.<br /><br />[This review comes from an advance copy bought at the FantasyCon, Brighton book launch on September 29th.]<br /><br />Also released today is 'The Mammoth Book of Ghost Stories by Women' edited by Marie 0'Regan - well worth checking out!", "images": [], "asin": "0762445971", "parent_asin": "0762445971", "user_id": "AE4VY5DUIIVFL2KJE2UDCXQ7RXXQ", "timestamp": 1350550403000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}
{"rating": 3, "title": "A useful, but flawed book.", "text": "The title of this mathematics textbook indicates its intended audience:  \"Management, Life and Social Sciences\".

{"rating": 1, "title": "Completely unoriginal", "text": "There was some promise in the blurb of this book, which is why I picked it up to read, but then I realized it was just a rehash and remix of a bunch of other stories. *The Point* tells the story of a young adult who is wasting her amazing potential until a dramatic event gives her a choice of either going through a grueling training she doesn\u2019t want or getting a punishment. But as it turns out our reluctant protagonist turns out to be the great promising future for her people, especially since the vaguely hinted antagonist has the potential power to bring about an apocalypse. That makes our hero the one true future hope. Nevertheless, she must endure antagonism from her jealous classmates as well as incredibly cruel treatment from the teachers she\u2019s supposed to trust. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Yes, *The Point* is a mix of Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and the Divergent series with an antagonist who is a straight rip-off of Jessica Jones\u2019 Killgrave. The only thing unique here is the setting which is not quite West Point, but a secret alt-version of the Point just for superhumans buried under the real West Point. But it was never adequately explained why this was placed there, why they were training these people to be officers, especially since most of them\u2014apart from their powers\u2014seemed profoundly not to be Army officer material.<br /><br />Then there are the editorial problems. I can only hope that the review copy I read wasn\u2019t the final version because it wasn\u2019t just typos. At one point, several of the characters must have been different genders because, for paragraphs at a time, the wrong pronouns were used. At another point, the author forgot he told us that the character had a pretty good buzz, because then a couple pages later he tells us that she hasn\u2019t yet got a buzz on. Speaking of which, our protagonist is 18 years old and yet she drinks with no problem in a bar outside of West Point, while the author had just had someone telling another character they couldn\u2019t drink because of being underage. So why could our hero drink? No explanation. Those may seem like minor problems, but they are just a couple examples of the many structural and editing issues with this book.<br /><br />But what most put me off of this book was the incredible casual cruelty. What is it with young adult literature these days that they must always combine world-shattering stakes with incredible cruelty to the protagonist and their companions, not by their enemies, but the people who are supposed to be their mentors. Why can\u2019t we tell smaller stories? Not there shouldn\u2019t be important stakes, but what about consequences that are important to just, say, the protagonist. Okay, put their life on the line. But why must every story be about an incredibly evil enemy who must be destroyed to save the universe? It gets boring after a while.<br /><br />Bottom line is that *The Point* is not a book I can recommend.", "images": [], "asin": "1101967560", "parent_asin": "1101967560", "user_id": "AFWOJPC5VKJY4OGDKU2ICCWUAMBA", "timestamp": 1534016375460, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Wonderful New Fantasy Series", "text": "3.5 stars rounding to 4<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Defy. I went into this book without any idea what it was about, just that it was a new fantasy series, and I\u2019m always looking for new fantasy to read so I downloaded it asap.<br /><br />In Defy we meet Alexa Hollen\u2026 or Alex as she\u2019s better known. She\u2019s a member of the king\u2019s army, being forced to disguise herself as a boy in order to keep herself out of the situation that all other women are thrown into. With the help of her twin brother, Alex uses her skills to earn a position on the prince\u2019s guard.<br /><br />But this is where the main story begins. Even with her skills, she, Prince Damian and fellow guard and friend Rylan are abducted and dragged through the jungle to their enemy\u2019s gates. Where Alex soon finds out that things aren\u2019t exactly as she\u2019s been told, and the secret she and her brother were determined to keep, wasn\u2019t exactly as secret as they thought.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be straight up with you all\u2026 love triangle alert. But I think that is fairly evident based on the summary. I\u2019ll also be honest with you and tell you that I don\u2019t hate love triangles like I know some of you do. In this case, it\u2019s very evident to me who she is going to be with. But with this love triangle warning also comes an alert that this turned into being less about the situation Alexa finds herself in and more about how sexy the guys she is with are and I think ultimately that kind of frustrated me.<br /><br />The characters \u2013 while I didn\u2019t dislike any of them, I didn\u2019t immediately find myself clinging to any of them either. Is Prince Damian swoony \u2013 yes\u2026 is Rylan sweet and wonderful to Alex\u2026 yes\u2026 Is Alexa a strong-willed and independent young girl who can overcome anything \u2013 she sure is. All these things together didn\u2019t give me any strong feelings towards anyone in particular though. I just didn\u2019t feel that connection with anyone.<br /><br />My overall thoughts were this \u2013 The middle part of this book was slow going for me. I was incredibly bored during their trek through the jungle, but once we started to get a bit more action and less \u2018OMG who do I pick\u2019 I found myself enjoying the action and the unraveling of secrets. I think ultimately this is what saved this book for me, we ended up on a high note and I truly found myself finally enjoying the story.<br /><br />I think that for me, this was less fantasy and more YA romance with fantasy elements and I found myself hooked just enough there at the end to know that I will definitely be picking up book 2 in this series to see what Larson does and where this story goes.<br /><br />If you\u2019re looking for a quick read that is hopefully just the start to a wonderful new fantasy series, definitely check this one out!<br /><br />Thank you to netgalley & Scholastic for the advance copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.", "images": [], "asin": "0545597587", "parent_asin": "0545597587", "user_id": "AEN5SFCSO5L4XDEHZ7B4LYYICXJQ", "timestamp": 1414854015000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Skip it...", "text": "I listened to the audio book and the narrator Kyle McCarley did a fantastic job. He is the only reason why I finished the book. Because if I had read this it would've been DNF less than 50 pages in.<br /><br />This book is the a reminder for me to be careful what I wish for. The last couple of books I read were sorely lacking in world building, this book took it too far. I could see everything because the details were written that intricately. To the point of boredom. Rooms, clothes, jewelry. Names of titles of nobles, religious leaders, and ceremonies were invented. Which is great, but there were so many it was hard to keep track. Standard names like Lord and Priest would've worked too for lesser characters. I also found it weird that all these intricate names and ceremonies were created, but the animals were standard. And although there was mention of magic there wasn't any in this book.<br /><br />Maia, our hero was boring. The standard orphan forced out of seclusion. The problem is there was nothing outstanding about him. He was nice, but no saint. He was smart, but no genius. He wasn't ugly by Elf society standards, but he was no great beauty either. There was nothing about him that stood out. Nothing to make the reader root for him to \"win\". He was a competent ruler, but no champion of the people. If they had killed him off and replaced him at any point in the book I honestly wouldn't have cared.<br /><br />That is another problem with this story. For one that focused on political intrigue and court politics it was lacking both. Starting with our main character. His banishment being accepted by everyone made no sense. His mother a goblin was married to his father to foster an alliance. So her being banished with her baby right after giving birth for the crime of not being an Elf was beyond stupid. Her father the Goblin Emperor should've had more of a reaction. Then she dies and her son, a Prince is sent off to west bubble fuq. Again the Goblin Emperor does nothing. A man with no male heir. He didn't even send a tutor. Maia the fourth son of the Elf Kingdom and the only Prince of the Goblin Kingdom wasn't educated in anything by anyone. He was sent of to rot, when he should've been a pawn his entire life. There were almost no plots at court, no maneuvering.  Just snobs being jerks.<br /><br />It takes forever for there to be any real conflict and even longer for us to find out what happened to his father and brothers. And both things are resolved with relative ease. How does something finally exciting happen, yet it almost instantly becomes boring too. I really don't understand how this book got nominated for so many awards. It must've been a slow year. I won't say I won't ever read this author again, but I won't be reading any more books in this series.", "images": [], "asin": "B094LL1GVT", "parent_asin": "B094LL1GVT", "user_id": "AHVZVOTCYCNGJIBJC2F5HOYFBKVA", "timestamp": 1626844509983, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

Instead, it is fascinating and riveting, providing EVERY important direct source document associated with the U.S., from its birth to its continuation into the modern age.<br /><br />Brilliantly, editors Bruun and Crosby have also managed to include \"documents\" almost never included in history books -- speeches, articles and even poetry -- related to the primary documents of the events of the particular period.<br /><br />For example, official documents pertaining to the Great Depression are reprinted, along with a section from John Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath,\" a novel of people who lived and suffered through those Dust Bowl days. Likewise, not only is the Executive Order interning Japanese Americans during World War II included, so is a side-bar describing the impact on Japanese American families who lost all of their property.<br /><br />In an age when everything in society seems to revolve around the latest technological advancement, it is very centering to go through this book and read the true historical achievements of these incredible United States. Vividly illustrating its tragedies, as well as the justice and injustice done in the name of this nation, this book is truly like no other.<br /><br />From the Declaration of Independence and the courts, to the true voices of vaunted politicians in their own words as well as the views of everyday citizens, events come to life in as astonishing a publishing accomplishment to come along in decades.<br /><br />With a \"couldn't-be-cheaper\" price, this edition deserves to be in every home, library and school room in America. Even if you thought you knew the history of the United States from sea to shining sea, there is plenty inside these pages to surprise, delight or even sadden and sicken the most careful scholar.<br /><br />Looked at in its entirety, this single volume not only educates, but in this new millennium, provides a sobering atmosphere to ponder the future of the country and every person's role as a responsible citizen.

To be honest, this book was not what I expected it to be, but that turned out to be a really good thing.<br /><br />Grimm\u2019s writing is beautiful, evocative, and had a nice flow that made it easy to read. The premise is intriguing and had me hooked from the very first page. I thought the idea of witching and summoning spirits was quite fascinating and I wanted to know more about it. The plot is fast-paced and full of action. The mystery, suspense, and danger had me holding my breath a few times and I absolutely loved it!<br /><br />The characters are so well written and realistic. I liked Allie from the start and I understood her reasons for doing what she did. Cody is very caring and kind that seeing him so guilt-ridden was distressing. Both Allie and Cody are dealing with their own losses and struggling with grief that my heart completely broke for them. It just seemed so right that they would find comfort in each other. While there was an instant attraction between Allie and Cody, I thought their chemistry felt genuine and real. Watching them help each other heal and develop a playful and sweet relationship was so satisfying. Their bantering and flirting made me smile and swoon so much.... instalove or not, I totally ship Allie and Cody and I rooted for them the entire time.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love that Summoner is not your typical young adult paranormal romance. There\u2019s definitely the supernatural fantasy aspect, the mysterious hard to resist hot guy, and plenty of adorable flirting. BUT more than that, this book deals with difficult real life issues. Grimm does a terrific job portraying the sadness of losing someone you love and the agony of living with guilt. She shows how healing and learning to forgive yourself are not that easy and will take time. I really wasn\u2019t expecting this to be deeply affecting or heartbreaking, but that\u2019s what makes this story brilliant and so powerful. And yes\u2026 I absolutely recommend that everyone pick this up!<br /><br />I received an advanced reader copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a fair review.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Hardly a substitute for the anime, but still a great read.", "text": "&quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; has been dubbed one of the greatest anime series ever, and rightfully so. Its plots are original and action-packed, its dub has been called one of the best ever done, and its characters are some of the most beloved characters in the anime community. So it's no surprise that TOKYOPOP decided to bring the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga to the States. Using TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga is a set of stories told within the universe of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; before the final set of episodes. Sadly, the manga is nothing compared to the anime masterpiece; even so, fans of the series and fans of manga in general owe it to themselves to give this manga a look at least.<br />The anime series follows an episode-like format for the most of its 26-episode run (meaning episodes don't have overlapping storylines), and the manga is no different. The first volume of the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga presents four different stories that deal with the characters of the &quot;Bebop&quot;, following their adventures and misadventures as they try to nab bounties so they can collect the reward money and get food in their stomachs. Almost any &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; fan will praise the anime series as having highly original stories and adventures that define the series. Unfortunately, that same fan will most likely look at the stories in the manga and say they are formulaic. Also, the stories has odd pacing issues in several areas, making the volume feel a little unbalanced. Even so, the stories are quite entertaining and do capture some of the charm of the anime. But anyone hoping the manga will hold over as a substitute for the anime until the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; movie arrives on American shores will be sorely disappointed.<br />Visually, some fans might be put off by the artist's interpretation of the characters. Characters in the manga do resemble their anime counterparts, but sometimes they can look a tad-bit distorted. And seeing Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein in chibi-like forms can be a little awkward, considering this rarely happened in the anime. Still, the visual artwork of the manga isn't anything to be disgusted at, but fans of the anime will wants to approach this with caution.<br />In terms of translation, I can honestly say that TOKYOPOP is getting better. Previous efforts such as &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; and &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; used text that was most likely typed in a machine, resulting in several horrible typos, and TOKYOPOP has always been known to deliver mediocre translations. With &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, the text appears to be drawn and not typed, resulting in fewer typos; I couldn't find any at all in this volume. While the translation might be questionable to some people, it doesn't sound static and flat; I actually consider this one of TOKYOPOP's better efforts. And with TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Format&quot;, the volume is read right-to-left, giving it a more authentic feel. It also makes the artwork clearer to see; since it hasn't been photo-reversed, the artwork isn't blurred, dimmed, or distorted.<br />All in all, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; is a good manga series, but only for the right kind of person. Fans of the anime will want to be careful with this series, and manga readers unfamiliar with the anime should also be wary. Still, the manga is very entertaining and is good enough to hold the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; name. And thanks to TOKYOPOP's better-than-normal translation and their &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga can be enjoyed even further.<br />Until volume 2, &quot;SEE YOU, SPACE COWBOY...&quot;", "images": [], "asin": "1931514917", "parent_asin": "1931514917", "user_id": "AHXBKVVSXTNUDA2ZOVDW37NTXWJQ", "timestamp": 1019443683000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 5, "title": "&quot;Part beauty mark, part brand, a legacy of tribal values.&quot;", "text": "In this poignant and sometimes melancholy account of the passing of an era, Mira Kamdar tells the story of her beloved grandmother Motiba, a woman from the agrarian and pastoral culture of old Gujarat, showing how the changes in Motiba's life and family during the past seventy years are also emblematic of dramatic changes in Indian culture as a whole.  Herself the daughter of Motiba's son Prabhakar (Pete) and Lois Christensen, the Danish-American cowgirl he married while a student in the United States in the 1960's, Kamdar is especially sensitive to nuances of culture, and she brings her Indian family to life within the context of the country's history--her grandparents' marriage, her grandfather's adoption of the values of Mahatma Gandhi, the emigration of the family to Burma to manage their businesses there in the 1930's, the bombing of Rangoon by the Japanese during World War II, the return to Bombay, and eventually, the emigration of several of Motiba's children to the United States.<br />As she describes her own life, the author shifts her focus to that of the American immigrant experience.  The tales of Indian history which infused her life as a child visiting in India eventually give way completely to tales of her life in the United States, as she moves with her parents and siblings throughout the west following her father's job changes.  The significance of the death of Gandhi on her grandmother's life yields its place to the effects of the death of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King on her parents' and her own life.  Her father's desire to have his family &quot;fit in&quot; becomes more important to him than teaching them the language and culture in which he grew up.<br />Rich, warm, humorous, and earnest, Motiba's Tattoos recreates the universal story of an immigrant family's metamorphosis from one whose primary allegiance is to another culture to one in which opportunities to assimilate are recognized and embraced.  In the process of becoming American, uniquely personal values may evolve and be treasured, while retention of the old traditions must become a conscious effort.  What was an integral part of their family life, historically, evolves into pleasant memories and echoes of the old way of life as new generations appear--the final result of the Indian diaspora, which began in the mid-20th century and which continues, unabated, to the present day.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Lovely voice and setting, but overly ambitious mythic influences sap character autonomy, and the book collapses. Not recommended", "text": "Captured from her father's sacked castle, Arpazia is wed to the warlord Draco and bears his child, Coria. Isolated and maddened, Arpazia abandons her daughter--but as Arpazia ages to cronehood and Coria comes of age, the two are tied together by their competing, opposing roles. Mixing the fairy tale of Snow White with the Greek myth of Persephone and early Christian liturgy, White as Snow is bursting with imagery that sometimes weaves a complex, symbolic tapestry and sometimes tangles upon itself in an excess of influence. White as Snow nails its voice and setting and is often an immersive read, but the confused symbolism and unmotivated characters hold it back from being all that it could be. In all, a disappointment and not recommended. (Terri Windling's introduction, on the other hand, is a joy to read.)<br /><br />What Lee writes best in White as Snow is the voice and setting, a combination which brings the story to life: detailed, haunting, ancient, and utterly convincing, the book is a step back in time and into another, more magical world. And so from the onset, and for its greater part, White as Snow feels like a successful book. It is certainly compelling and immersive, and only gets better when Lee introduces familiar mythic aspects: Snow White and the jealous Queen, Persephone's relationship with the seasonal cycle and the underworld, and the temptation of the deadly sins and the tree of knowledge. But as the book goes on, the convincing setting and voice are not enough: it begins to fall apart.<br /><br />The glut of symbols and myths is ambitious, but overly so: it's an excess of outside influence which doesn't always mesh together. (An example: is the queen's apple the fruit of the tree of knowledge, or a poison, or the gateway to the underworld? Though similar, these symbols are not all one and the same--and it takes more than 300 pages and two characters to unite them.) To compensate, Arpazia and Coria lack motivation, that they are better able to conform to the influences that dictate the courses of their lives. But an unmotivated protagonist rarely makes for a compelling book, and so when the characters are passive figures in the most important events (in particular, Snow White's death) the book collapses in on itself, a victim of too many symbols and not enough of its own plot or characters. I wanted to enjoy White as Snow, and for the most part the writing style and good intentions won me over. But the more I read, the more my doubts grew--and I came away disappointed. It's a good try, but not a success, and I don't recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "0312875495", "parent_asin": "0312875495", "user_id": "AFEURQMGWI3LXF5Y5SAFUT5CUMOA", "timestamp": 1244008396000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Skip the Sequel", "text": "I happened across Finney's Time and Again and it was a delight...highly original, vivid in its descriptions of 19th century New York with an engaging plot and characters. This sequel is a messy follow-up that is just too forced. One of its characters states that he dislikes the word \"nostalgia\" but that is what this whole effort communicates.

The Reds maintain the traditional American values, it\u2019s Constitution, free markets, personal liberties and free speech.  And you know where Schlichter takes it from there.  With dripping sarcasm, he describes life in the Blue zone pretty much as it is in Venezuela and Cuba by simply extending the existing trends of today\u2019s Left.  His military background lends credibility to his protagonist, Kelly Turnbull (ex-Special Forces) who is hired, from time to time, by the USA to conduct secret missions behind enemy lines.  Turnbull turns out to be a stone-cold killing machine. So, Schlichter combines politics and action-adventure to create some pretty funny and entertaining stuff.

So there's that half star the book doesn't get.<br /><br />I was thinking about the difference in our reactions to the beginning of the book (daughter: &#34;what's going on? Who is she? Why do they point a gun at her? Why are the adults so mean?&#34; and me: Ooo, look what Carey is doing here by setting up Melanie as our POV character in the beginning, he can make us entirely sympathetic to Melanie and her girl-crush on her teacher Ms Justineau while at the same time give massive hints to readers familiar with the paranormal fantasy tropes of what exactly the reason is that everyone treats her like garbage and she isn't let out into the outside world) and I think its based on the fact that I am a long-time fantasy/sci fi fan and so pretty much immediately knew what was up with Melanie.<br /><br />My daughter didn't, and so the fact that the book doesn't start answering questions until about halfway through really bothered her.<br /><br />This is mostly a thriller and adventure-through-ruins-of-society kind of story. While Melanie is the main character, we mostly get her POV in the beginning long enough for us to get attached, and then we get shifting POV as she travels with Ms. Justineau, a scientist, and a few soldiers towards the city of Beacon. By the time the POV shifted, it was fine, I was already hooked to Melanie.<br /><br />Another thing that pleased me about this book was the level of science. There are medical explanations and descriptions of cool med-tech tools used in discovering those explanations for Melanie's condition that totally ring true.<br /><br />But the thing that stood out for me the most is that this book really delves into human relationships vis-a-vis the difference between the terrible creatures outside the gates, Melanie herself, Caldwell the cruel and detached scientist, and Ms. Justineau. What are the emotions that make us human? At what point is it worth saying &#34;humans&#34; deserve to live and win-out over other creatures if those humans are willing to perpetuate atrocities in order to do so?<br /><br />And what about the fierce, uncomplicated loyalty and love between mother-figure and daughter?<br /><br />Cool science, awesomely conflicted and sympathetic heroine, and a movie-worthy visual adventure.", "images": [], "asin": "0316278157", "parent_asin": "0316278157", "user_id": "AEPCSZVWVFOERFGK27XCESCFWIGA", "timestamp": 1404139250000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Little House By Boston Bay", "text": "Although not written by Ingalls, Little House By Boston Bay continues in the spirit of her books.  This time it centers on Charlotte, the grandmother of Laura Ingalls Wilder.  It is the first book in the series and starts when Charlotte is almost five years old.<br /><br />Most of the book details Charlotte's life and the almost year that it covers.  Most notably, this book takes place during the War of 1812 and so there is quite a bit of information included in there; especially a copy of the Star Spangled Banner and other songs.  Charlotte's days are filled with chores and playing with her new doll whom she has trouble naming.  She also goes to school and meets a new friend named Susan and even tries to go to Scotland (although she doesn't realize how far away it is.)  She listens to her mother's stories and helps with setting the table with her special \"Saturday Family\" (jars, bottles and etc. with condiments for the table).<br /><br />The characters in this book are mostly well written.  I do think that Charlotte, being 4-5 in this book, sounds a little too old and mature for the age.  But times were different back then so I could be wrong.  Her brothers and sisters are present but not really developed too much; the same goes for her father.  Where the characters really shine though is her mother.  Her mother is a bright personality with a lot of oomph in her and there is quite a bit of detail written about her.<br /><br />Wiley has a nice writing style and it is somewhat similar in style to Wilders.  She adds the same element of almost a diary type of writing as the other Little Houses' do, but doesn't have as much useful information within the pages.  Out of everything that is described, it is not done in a way that makes me think I could repeat it like I could with the original series.  However, there is a recipe for pounded cheese that almost seems doable by reading the description.  This is a great book for kids and reading it at my age is probably why I find more fault with it in this regards.  It is a simple story about a girl and her life.<br /><br />Not my favorite of the whole grouping of books but it wasn't bad either.  The whole series from Laura's stories, to her mothers, and so-on are a charming group of books.  They are perfect for cozying up by a fire and reading with your children, or even by yourself for reminiscing.<br /><br />Little House By Boston Bay<br />Copyright 1999<br />195 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Good start to a promising conclusion", "text": "3.5 stars \u2026 this is a fairly new author to me; I like her dark and depraved imagination and the blurb definitely hooked me in. I read yellow thorns which is actually the first 3 chapters of this book rather than a teaser to whet your appetite of what was to come so I did feel a little cheated here.<br /><br />Continuing on\u2026 the story had great potential. Plenty of crumbs dropped at secrets and current events in the plot that I thoroughly enjoyed. It\u2019s a typical NA bully type romance; one girl on the out and bullied by the mean girls. My heart instantly went out to Naomi but the character was strong and was able to hold her own which I enjoyed. Giving the proverbial middle finger to anyone that tries to belittle her.<br /><br />Along comes the star quarterback, the hot guy everyone wants. Whilst he had my attention; once he set his sights on Naomi it\u2019s like a switch flipped on his personality so I felt it was missing development here. Then for the next 50% of the book it\u2019s about the chase / the protests and what happens when he catches her. This I thought went on for far too long. It was unnecessary filler. Great dark, depraved raw sex but way too much. It brought nothing further to the story IMO and the plot didn\u2019t really develop and was spent solely on these two characters. Once we got past this it was back to the plot that I was invested in.<br /><br />The last 20% had me hooked and kept me invested enough to want to know the answers and what\u2019s in store for these characters.

{"rating": 4, "title": "\"A Red Menace in Beautiful Venice!\"", "text": "I found this book on an Amazon Kindle special, and I was pleasantly surprised!  \"Red Blitz\" is the first work by James Raven I have read, and I know I shall try another.  The terrorism theme in the book is sadly becoming more and more plausible in today's world; I think if I had read this 20 years or so ago, its \"realism\" would not have been as great as it is today.  In the first few chapters, we discover that dozens of bombs have been hidden throughout Venice by a terrorist who is found dead.  But, as time quickly passes, things are not quite what they appear to be.<br /><br />The story line was good; it was not the most challenging story I've read, but it was enjoyable and kept your interest. It is more of a novella than a fully developed novel - about 150 pages, but once you get reading, the pages turn faster and faster and suddenly you are done. Still, the plot was original, and the pace certainly drove the action along. The setting of Venice is beautiful and inspired. The characterization was good, and there were some well-rounded, nicely thought out characters. The shortness of the story limited some character development which would have strengthened the book. I especially liked the central character of  Armond Cali who is the current leader of Venice paramilitary police force, known as the Carabinieri. His character did actually seem like one who could evolve in another story.  I did struggle over three or four stars due mainly to the \"shortness\" of the story; I felt that more develop in story line and character would have helped.  However, due to the gripping, innovative nature of the plot which did create a \"page turner,\" I gave it four stars.  \"Red Blitz\" is a tense \"thriller\" which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre.", "images": [], "asin": "B00AFJOA1Q", "parent_asin": "B00AFJOA1Q", "user_id": "AEYY4B2QKL3TBBXEYIO5PG7LWA4Q", "timestamp": 1412013123000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 4}

To try to understand how or why someone could treat another person, let alone their own child, in such a horrible way...it's almost impossible.  I have spent many years trying to understand.  I think it's even worse when the abuser denies that it ever happened.  I only now realized there is a first book.  I'm glad to know that this sad and frightening tale has a happy ending.  Yay for you, Sarah!!  Blessings to you and your family!  Much Love!", "images": [], "asin": "B0052751P0", "parent_asin": "B0052751P0", "user_id": "AEGGE5J6M42TRNRKHEG4LBE566DQ", "timestamp": 1336671084000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

{"rating": 4, "title": "\u201cEvery ugly toad thinks that sooner or later he is going to get to eat the meat of a swan.\u201d", "text": "Mai Jia, a popular novelist and winner of the Mao Dun Literature Prize, China\u2019s highest literary honor, writes here under a pen name after serving for seventeen years as a member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army and its intelligence services. Decoded, originally written and published for a Chinese audience in 2002, and newly translated and published in English, provides a fascinating study of cryptography and its dedicated cryptographers, many of whom give their lives (and even their sanity) to their work.  The exciting and revelatory translation by Olivia Milburn and Christopher Payne provides new insights into worlds that have been closed to most of us, not just the hidden world of cryptography and the psychological toll it takes on those who dedicate their lives to it, but also the world of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the thinking of many of its people.<br /><br />Astonishing in its focus on the travails and inner torments of one major character, Rong Jinzhen, the novel features a psychological, individualized approach, something I did not expect for characters living within the group culture of China, especially among characters from the army and its secret intelligence services. An orphan who grows up within two adoptive homes, Rong Jinzhen, known in childhood as \u201cDuckling,\u201d is a mathematical genius, called \u201cIdiot Savvy\u201d in school, but he never stops feeling isolated and apart, however praised he might be for his brilliance and dedication to intellectual goals.  He counts ants, the days that his \u201cDaddy\u201d has lived on earth before his death at age eighty-eight, invents his own multiplication tables, and becomes a chess player at the highest level of competition.<br /><br />The older and more dedicated he becomes to what he is learning, however, the more preoccupied \u2013 even autistic \u2013 he becomes.  With his lively mind focused totally on intellectual goals, he evokes our concern as he fails to make friends or find any happiness or inner peace. When he is eventually selected to work as a cryptographer for the state, he must leave behind everything he has ever known to participate at a remote and secret location on a project which will eventually consume him \u2013 the deciphering of PURPLE, the most difficult cipher ever created.  Once Rong Jinzhen (often called Zhendi by those who remember him) disappears into Unit 701, he is essentially lost to everyone else who has known him as he works to break this code for his country.<br /><br />The remainder of the novel appears in the form of interviews with two people, Master Rong, a female member of his family whom he saved during the Cultural Revolution, and Director Zheng, the man who persuaded him to join the cryptography unit.  These interviews convey Jinzhen\u2019s history and his story, but they feature much \u201ctelling about\u201d the action, instead of creating lively stories told from \u201cinside the moment.\u201d The author\u2019s use of dreams, often disorderly, reveal Jinzhen\u2019s state of mind, and a shift in style from narrative to Jinzhen\u2019s internal reveries to convey his inner turmoil in the middle section of the novel show his alarming changes. A literary novel, unique in its focus, setting, and subject matter, Decoded lives up to its title, providing exciting new insights into many aspects of life in the People\u2019s Republic of China - and if a reader also happens to be a mathematician or serious games player\u00ac, this novel will be utterly irresistible.", "images": [], "asin": "0374135800", "parent_asin": "0374135800", "user_id": "AHZZL323ORE6AHMIB2OCLYNCRXJQ", "timestamp": 1397785497000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Not the best Grisham", "text": "John Grisham has written a number of very good legal thrillers. The Appeal is not one of them. I have three reasons for my low rating.<br />1. It is too black and white. All the bad guys are uniformly bad and the good guys uniformly good. The main plot involves a chemical company dumping toxic wastes that contaminate the water supply of a small Mississippi town resulting in numerous deaths from cancer. Finally, after her husband and son die from cancer a woman sues the company. A husband and wife team prosecute the case and the jury awards the woman $41 million. Of course the company appeals and a group of sleazy political operatives arrange for a young lawyer to run for the Mississippi Supreme Court with the intention of overturning the verdict.<br /><br />2. It Is hard to tell fact from fiction. In the Author's Note Grisham admits that much of the novel is made up. At the same time some of it is factual. It is hard to tell the difference. For example Grisham cites statistics the show Mississippians to be gun-loving, religiously conservative bigots and the appellate justice system to be corruptible.<br /><br />3. The ending is unsatisfying and incomplete. The reader is left with a feeling of injustice being done.

Kill or be killed establishes itself as a more grounded take on the vigilante genre of comics, but over four issues, I'm not really looking forward to more.<br /><br />The story starts on our main character killing a bunch of gang members, and him flashing back to how he got to this point. Dylan is a professional student with a lot (and I mean a lot) of mental health problems. After attempting to take his own life, he sees a demon (or does he!?) who tells him that unless he takes a life of someone who deserves it every month, he'll die instead. The story then follows his first sloppy kills to when I suppose he eventually gets good.<br /><br />I suppose my basic problem with the series is that it both wants to act as political commentary while also being bleak for the sake of being bleak. Dylan is prone to making standard political commentary about police violence, the drug trade, and social problems, which is fine as far as it goes. But he also wants to disregard the law and kill people to make the world better, which goes against pretty much everything the first thing is trying to be. This type of having the cake and eating it too results in some of the worst Punisher stories, and it doesn't work any better here. The fact that all the main characters are basically screw-ups didn't endear me to them either.<br /><br />I will say the artwork is good, but I'm not planning on going any further with this series.", "images": [], "asin": "1534300287", "parent_asin": "1534300287", "user_id": "AHHV4DVQ7GPHWOSROGQKKIP6C3KQ", "timestamp": 1652061782789, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

Wisher and narrated by Joe Hempel is the second in a trilogy of books. The story picks up at the end of the summer break as Conryu and Maria head to The North American Alliance\u2019s\u00a0Arcane\u00a0Academy\u00a0by a magically powered train. He is once again\u00a0harried\u00a0by the press and one reporter in particular.\u00a0Conryu\u00a0is a fish out of water at the academy. He does not want to be there any more than most of the student population that views him as an abomination wants him to be there. This could not be made more clear that his initial reception of being bombarded with tomatoes upon arrival by three upper-class wizards.<br /><br />The first book in the series was devoted to world building and giving broad strokes to a wide canvas to give the reader and listener a feel for what kind of scope there was to this magical world. This time out the author has pulled back to focus on the hero\u2019s journey. We get to see the highs and low\u2019s Conryu endures during his first semester at the Academy. He is ostracized, attacked, and even Maria has little time for him. What is the only male wizard to do?<br /><br />Conryu\u00a0strives to make the best of it while trying to slowly understand his magical abilities and learn to live in a world foreign to him. He slowly makes friends and joins a Wizards club. As the semester goes on life moves on for both Conryu and Maria. When she is No longer the center of Conryu\u2019s universe leads it leads to Maria\u2019s consternation.<br /><br />Attention Holding<br /><br />The story is excellent at holding my attention and was over much too soon. There are bound to be some comparisons to Harry Potter due to the Magic Train and a\u00a0Magic\u00a0Academy. But that\u2019s about where it will end. These books are for older audiences and Harry Potter never signed a contract with a Demon. The world is unique and thought-provoking and holds the listener's interest due to the great story and the great narration.<br /><br />Narration/Production Quality<br /><br />The narration is by Joe Hempel. Mr. Hempel again provides an outstanding vocal performance in this second audiobook in this series. He delivers not only compelling narration but also provides a wide range of vocal character\u2019s interpretations. Each character was recognizable with unique voices done in a natural manner. The production quality by Tantor was top of the line as always they never fail to produce a high-quality audio product. Tantor delivered a crystal clear product of the highest listening quality.<br /><br />Audiobook was provided for review by the narrator.<br /><br />Please find this complete review and many others at my review blog.<br /><br />[If this review helped, please press YES.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A book about the business of rock 'n roll, not the music", "text": "I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is well researched and extensively detailed. On the other, much of this information is hardly bias-free, being shared with the author by Klein's son, Jody, in the hope that Goodman's biography will change the public perception. (That perception, basically, was that Allen Klein was a talented businessman--as a manager of some of the most important musicians of the 1960s and 1970s--but one who bilked major music artists out of fortunes, while still increasing the percent of earnings the artists themselves were earning. Klein was a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a man--and his story is a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a biography.)<br /><br />Klein is quite a character-- a Jewish boy who spent some of his childhood in an orphanage and much of the rest, passed around experiencing the &#34;school of hard knocks&#34;. He emerged a tough, shrewd guy who learned to be an accountant and wasn't afraid to give unwelcome financial news to clients--even when they were members of the Mafia.  This tough-talking street savvy guy seemed perfect as a business manager for musicians and it's mainly on his relationships as the manager for many legends that this book concentrates. Among them are Bobby Darin, Sam Cooke, The Who, Donovan, Dave Clark, and - of course- per the title, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles (the latter, only after they had stopped performing as a group).<br /><br />If the rock and roll business and its history interests you, you may enjoy Klein's story. For me, there just wasn't enough about the musicians or the music (other than confirming my feeling that I'd like Paul McCartney in person. The other Beatles, urged on by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were on board for Klein as their manager. But McCartney didn't like or trust him--as it turned out, with good reason--and this division was part of what precipitated their breakup, per Goodman).<br /><br />My review is mixed just as my feelings about Klein are mixed. Again, the good thing is that Klein found so many artists who were in terrible financial contracts and extricated them then made their music more profitable for them than before. On the other hand, he took a lot of these new-found profits for himself and, much worse imo, he took the rights to their songs for himself and in most cases they were unable to get them back. In 1970, the Stones fired him, only to discover that he owned many of their songs and records. He did the same to the Beatles and they learned the same thing. He went to prison in 1979 for tax evasion but only served two months.<br /><br />Writing-wise, this is very detailed--sometimes too much so in describing people Klein interacted with--but he never really &#34;came alive&#34; to me in the telling. Perhaps it was because the author--so close to the son--is guarded in how negative to make Klein appear but as a result, it seems kind of flat and doesn't really &#34;ring true&#34;. I didn't see any interviews with McCartney (who didn't trust him--and was right) or Jagger (who hated Klein's guts for ripping them off) and their versions of events might have given this book the passion and emotion it otherwise lacked by, in my opinion, trying to gloss over a bit of what Klein really was and what he did.", "images": [], "asin": "0547896867", "parent_asin": "0547896867", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1434519867000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Like Seeing an Old Friend Again After a Long Separation", "text": "I have really enjoyed this series - now up to number 12 I think with this installment. It is unique in many ways and teaches many lessons about life.<br /><br />When I first heard about the series, it was on book 6. It worked out well, because I had so many books to read without having to wait. Now, I am all caught up, so the year between books seems like a very long time. It is like having to wait before getting to see an old friend again - well, the old friend in this case has come back for a visit!<br /><br />Besides the more obvious things like the great characters in the series - after a while they seem like you actually know them as you would real people - what I really liked about the series is the detail about Botswana and life there. And so much of it is positive, unlike so much of what you hear about Africa these days. The books also teach many lessons useful to people everywhere, but from a Botswana/African perspective that can really shine a light where it needs to shine sometimes.<br /><br />The first book was especially good in portraying the Botswana background and viewpoint - I assume accuracy here as the author lived there a long time. The author seemed to move away from this as the series progressed; a disappointment for me, even though the books were still interesting. The good news is that I think the author is headed back in the right direction here with the last few books.<br /><br />As an aside, the TV series is great too; last time I looked into the matter, it does not look like the series with continue into a second season, but there is talk of a movie which is better than nothing. Most of the characters in the TV series were about as I had pictured them from the book - the main exception being Mma Makutsi. The actress that played her did a great job though; she just looked a little different from how I had pictured her from the book.<br /><br />Now on to the new book itself. I am happy to see that this new book stays closer to the series roots in many respects showing us some more about the real Botswana. The overall plot seems very vigorous too. I won't go into that too much as readers usually like a surprise, but here's a look at main story lines in the new book without giving things away.<br /><br />Remember the tiny white van that Mma Precious Ramotswe has been so attached to in the series? It is gone, but she is seeing visions of it. Hmm, that sounds like an interesting phenomenon. Where will this go? You'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />At a cattle post, two cows have been killed, and Mma Ramotswe is asked to investigate. Lots of suspects as it turns out, making it a challenge for our favorite Botswanan lady detective. Does she solve the mystery? No spoilers here, you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />One of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's apprentices may have gotten a girl pregnant; he runs away when pressure builds to marry her. Will those young men ever finish their apprenticeships and stay out of trouble?<br /><br />The \"villianess\", Violet Sephotho, is back. Remember her? She did horribly at the secretarial college when Mma Makutsi was there and shows up now and then to make poor Grace miserable. Anyway, Violet is running for the Botswana Parliament. They'd have to be desperate to elect her. What is up with this? Well, you'll have to open up the book to find out.<br /><br />And a perfect pair of wedding shoes - series fans will be pretty sure that the \"shoephile\" Mma Makutsi must be involved with those. Will Phuti Radiphuti finally marry Grace? The title of the book seems to refer to a wedding happening, but will it be Grace's or for the run away apprentice? Again, I won't tell here - you'll have to read the book.<br /><br />Lots of interesting things are in store for readers here. I hope that series fans will come back and read this latest book, meet favorite characters again, be entertained, and learn something about Botswana and life in general as well.", "images": [], "asin": "030737839X", "parent_asin": "030737839X", "user_id": "AHFRMLWCPZ6HCCCXBVH5KNDZJVSA", "timestamp": 1300777369000, "helpful_vote": 84, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Bane of the Spider Queen", "text": "Originally published in 1990, R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy set in the Forgotten Realms shone like a beacon in the fantasy genre. It was, and still is, comparable to Tolkein's Lord of the Rings and Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman's Dragon Lance series and - like those - is still being sold in nearly every major bookstore today.<br /><br />Then, in 2005, Devil's Due Publishing (traditionally known for their G.I. Joe and Transformers comics) began releasing a comic adaptation of the story with a script by Andrew Dabb and wonderfully detailed pencils by Tim Seeley.<br /><br />Naturally the full plot of the novels can't be fit into three trade paperbacks, but all of the essentials are still there. We can see the development, decline and eventual resolution of the relationship between Drizzt Do'Urden and his father Zaknafein and, most importantly, the bond between Drizzt and the ever-faithful Guenhwyvar, his panther companion from the astral plane.<br /><br />Drizzt was born in the underdark beneath the ground in the drow city of Menzoberranzan, a city run by the female priests of the dark spider goddess Lolth who relishes only evil and treachery. Brought up in a society so far detached from our own we would die within a day even if not for our pale skin, Drizzt is raised to be a ruthless and cunning killer.<br /><br />But Drizzt is born different from his kin and kind. He possesses an unimpeachable sense of honor despised by the spider queen who seeks only his death to \"appease\" for the good he has done, such as saving the life of a surface dweller in a drow raid aboveground.<br /><br />Rather than face certain death at the hands of his own family in order to restore their honor, Drizzt ventures out into the underdark with only Guenhwyvar at his side. But for the most reviled of the intelligent races in the realms it will be difficult to survive in the most dangerous corridors of the underdark. Thus must Drizzt journey to the surface to face a world unknown to any drow before him.<br /><br />The artwork in these comics is just astounding. Although much of the action takes place in the bleak environs of the underdark, the art remains colorful and vivid. Never have I wanted to visit a place so dangerous. The action is well wrought and never leaves you with a sense of confusion despite the numerous fights between Drizzt, who expertly wields two scimitars in battle, and the numerous horrors of the underdark and surface.<br /><br />Despite lacking the complexity and depth of the original novels, this is a series well worth adding to your collection.", "images": [], "asin": "1932796800", "parent_asin": "1932796800", "user_id": "AGJU5PF6DMO6VHT2PI5NEWCSV67Q", "timestamp": 1185203757000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Of Choices and Word Paintings", "text": "L.M. Ross's The Moanin' After is a book about choices--choosing to live, choosing to die, and choosing to forgive.  In this, Ross's second novel, we follow his protagonist David on his harrowing journey through grief.  Ross beautifully shows us that grief is not a solitary process.  David touches lives in his quest to understand and accept the deaths of his friends Face Depina and, most importantly, Tyrone Hunter.<br /><br />And author Ross also makes choices.  Ross has grown as a writer since his first novel.  In it, Manhood The Longest Moan, Ross used his gloriously beautiful figures of speech to excess.  He created six or eight metaphors, similes, etc., and strung them together.  In The Moanin' After, Ross wisely chooses the two or three best of his creations to make his points.  And he makes them amazingly.  The reader can revel in his descriptions.  A poet at heart, Ross knows his subjects:  jazz, New York City, gay life, and what it means to be a Black man.  His word portraits rapturously evoke, sometimes bringing chills down the spine.<br /><br />If anyone deserves a deal with a major publisher, it is Ross.  An editor at Little Brown, Simon and Schuster, Clarion, or any of the other \"big\" publishers could work with Ross and turn him from a very good writer into a great one.  The man knows how to use words in a commanding and beautiful way.  He truly deserves better than his present editor and publisher.<br /><br />His current publisher apparently is dedicated to bringing African-American writers to the marketplace.  What a fine and noble goal!  But when every page has five to fifteen errors, how can this publisher be taken seriously?  The reader is forced to wade through sentences filled with repeated words and words left out.  Time and time again, verbs of two different tenses (think \"was\"/ \"were\") are both given, as if the reader might want a choice in the sentence.  Or could it be the editor or proofreader couldn't make the choice him or herself?  And the commas!  My lord, my lord...they are just thrown in willy-nilly.  Someone needs to send this editor a grammar book--STAT!<br /><br />L.M. Ross needs to be read, not decoded.  If there is a publishing god out there, please let Her send an angel to plop Ross's next manuscript on the desk of an editor familiar with the English language.<br /><br />Ross serves the gay community, the Black community, and the community at large with his humanity and his word paintings.  Read The Moanin' After--it has power and grace.  And after you read it, pass your copy on to your publisher friend...you know, the one who sits in an ivory tower office in Manhattan, waiting for the next great African-American author.", "images": [], "asin": "1933967358", "parent_asin": "1933967358", "user_id": "AEZEFRB2AQ2EXQ3ZKPLAB7SSL6QA", "timestamp": 1211126938000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Slow moving but intriguing premise of disturbing psychological influence", "text": "This book is suspenseful in a very slow way. I found the premise intriguing- participating in a psychological experiment of sorts that becomes a little twisted and reality is blurred from the manipulation. In actuality, I wouldn\u2019t put much emphasis on the blurred reality part of the advertised summary- not really the plot. There\u2019s times Jessica wonders if an everyday encounter is part of the experiment but it\u2019s not really a \u2018is she losing her mind\u2019 kind of manipulation.<br /><br />Jessica enters a psychology study to earn more money for her family and the conductor of the study, Dr. Shields (no relation to me), takes a special interest in Jessica and asks more and more of her in future parts of the study. So there\u2019s this mystery of why Dr Shields is doing this study, why such an interest in Jessica, what happened to Subject 5, and can Dr Shields\u2019 spouse be trusted? To be honest, I was expecting darker answers to those questions than what turned out to be the case. I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I thought there would be a little more pulse-pounding action instead of neatly wrapping everything up with a bow.<br /><br />But I would still recommend this book. It was still engaging and as a psych minor, I enjoyed the psychology intertwined within, a lot of the referenced psych studies I remember from my classes. As long as you don\u2019t go into it expecting a lot of intense action and suspense I think you\u2019ll really like the story and seeing how things unfold. And it\u2019s kinda a freaky scenario to think about. The implications of something like this happening, of a therapist having such personal information and manipulating clients and having the capability to affect and influence their life is definitely worth exploring in a psychological thriller like this.<br /><br />One writing style thing to mention: the chapters alternate POVs. It\u2019s either told from Jessica\u2019s point of view (3rd person) where we can hear her thoughts or from Dr. Shields\u2019 (first person). But with Dr. Shields\u2019 chapters it\u2019s almost in letter or diary form directly addressing Jessica- which I didn\u2019t really like. It definitely makes it more creepy I suppose, but some of the vocabulary or descriptions seemed unnatural for that type of writing.<br /><br /> All in all- good book, will probably read others written by these authors.", "images": [], "asin": "1250133750", "parent_asin": "1250133750", "user_id": "AEX6GC25ANZIT36EQGUAJOGXCPLQ", "timestamp": 1600216830710, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

If using markers or gel pens, I definitely recommend placing a few sheets of blank paper in between the pages so they don't mark through. The page thickness is that of a normal piece of computer paper roughly. The pages are not perforated so they will not tear out unless you just rip them out neatly if you wanted to remove any.<br /><br />Overall, this is my favorite Sweary Coloring Book I have to date. Some of the books claim to have a lot of vulgar in them but they don't. this has a lot of &quot;colorful words&quot; in it that are just awesome! In my video, I show all the pages that come in the book so you can see everything in it and decide if it's for you. I however would definitely recommend it!<br />I received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

{"rating": 3, "title": "I don't get it...", "text": "Gee, so much hype about this book, how could I not read it? But now that I'm finished, I can't undrstand the hype...<br /><br />The story began well, with enough intrigue to make me wonder what the heck was wrong with this picture. And the language of the story (the writing itself) was very pleasing to follow.  But about half way through, after we discovered what was really happening with Amy, the plot became (in my opinion) implausible and a little silly.  The mystery started off seriously enough but then deviated into a soap opera tale of !megalomaniacal treachery! None of the potential plot lines from first part of the story were developed into anything diabolical ( e.g. the purchase of the gun, Nick's father's strange behavior at the housewarming, Amy's cryptic friendship with Noelle)--most of the mystery was dropped altogether--and then all of a sudden I was forced to accept an unbelievable (& I mean really not believable) turn of events unfitting of the characters thus far developed.  It was not like &#34;Wow! I didn't see THAT coming!!&#34; , it was more like &#34;No way! It wouldn't (or shouldn't) happen like that!!&#34;<br /><br />Another issue for me, that I realized about 3/4 of the way through, was that the main characters, Nick and Amy, were falsely developed. The first part of the story portrayed them, in depth, to be certain personalities, but then those were discarded in exchange for the more wicked traits of the revealed characters. I understand that this was supposed to be the big twist, but the second-part Nick and Amy were never really fleshed out to make them believable.  I felt as if I never had a grasp on Nick's character at all--was he a handsome streetwise literary? A small-minded, small-town dullard? A scheming, twisted match for his sociopathic wife? How was Amy ever beautiful and gracious, if she was only ever calculative and malevolent? And at what point did they become poison for each other? I was never made to understand how their relationship became a &#34;sick, toxic M&ouml;bius strip&#34;:  that would suggest long-standing dysfunction, but that part of their story was not written here.  I felt that, in order to appreciate the grand turn-of-events, I had to blindly accept that Amy, and to an extent, Nick, were, and had always been, evil.<br /><br />I have many other small issues with the plot, and was perplexed by the resignation of the ending, but suffice it to say that a story with great potential for intrigue and complexity veered off to become a typical bland, superficial, best-seller-list mystery (in my opinion).", "images": [], "asin": "B006LSZECO", "parent_asin": "B006LSZECO", "user_id": "AG6XDAZEEV7W5OBEIFHLMTQ7UJGQ", "timestamp": 1368768470000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 2}

{"rating": 1, "title": "Comical It's So Bad", "text": "I borrowed this book/DVD set from the library on a whim, and was leafing through the book when I noticed a some pictures in the Ground Fighting chapter that were straight out an entry-level jiu jitsu class when the instructor says, \"never do this\".  After studying various martial arts for a decade, I couldn't believe that the author was advocating passing a closed guard with one arm inside and the other outside of the opponent's locked legs, not to mention pictures of arm bars with the opponent's thumb pointing in the wrong direction, making the submission largely ineffective.  Then I flipped back through to the standup fighting techniques and began to notice some things that had evaded my first perusal: a ball-of-the-foot roundhouse kick, and the kind of old-school karate blocks look pretty badass in a kata, but will get you beaten to a pulp on the street.  While there are some effective, proven techniques in this book, there are also some maneuvers that could either get you hurt, or, in a best-case scenario, laughed at.<br />Thinking that the DVD could only be better, I gave that a try.  This was pure comedy, showcasing two stickly guys throwing half speed punches with the form of eight-year-old girls.  I can't believe this footage hasn't gone viral yet.  There was little to no editing as they were constantly readjusting the four tumbling mats that they had set up, and were often whispering instructions to one another.  At one point, the sound of a fire truck siren lingered outside of the building until they shut off the microphone and continued in silence.  I won't even get into this DVD's other home-movie production values.

This is the 3rd of her books I've read and it was very enjoyable. I thought there was solid writing throughout. There were numerous themes and sub themes and at one point I found myself asking \"who again is Harriett?\" So many characters to follow.

{"rating": 5, "title": "So much fun", "text": "Zentangle Dingbatz is a new tutorial guide for alternative and additional Zentangle techniques by Brian Crimmins. Released 11th June 2019 by Fox Chapel on their Design Originals imprint, it's 160 pages and available in paperback format.<br /><br />Zentangle is an accessible, fun, and valuable creativity exercise which packs a lot of mindfulness and stimulation into a very short time commitment. They're also really really fun to do. These extra techniques can be used on a variety of surfaces and in a variety of sizes. For readers who are previously unfamiliar with the process, the introductory chapter in this book explains the process including a step by step visual tutorial.<br /><br />The book has an easily accessible and logical layout. The introduction (~17% of the page content) introduces basic Zentangle concepts, starting instructions, and supplies for doing the projects. The next chapter provides the reader with a thorough tutorial showing the differences between the basic Zentangle tile art and 'Dingbatz' alternatives.<br /><br />The next chapters include specific project tutorials and inspiration including stationery, a handwritten 'zine, place cards, nametags, gift tags, journals, and several more.  Each of the chapters include a self-practice workbook area.<br /><br />The final chapter includes a tangle gallery with tutorials for some of the tangle elements used in the book. There is also a brief acknowledgement section with some references for further reading (including the facebook group mention), as well as an author statement and a short index.<br /><br />This is a useful, energetic, and accessible tutorial for all things Dingbatz.  The author has a refreshingly encouraging voice and readers of all levels of expertise can use this guide to produce beautifully useful finished objects. The style of zentangle art makes them organic and structured at the same time. I really love the look of them.<br /><br />This would make a superlative gift along with some pens and tiles or a journal for a drawing friend (or oneself).<br /><br />Five stars.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fun and thoughtful!", "text": "When Alice Love falls and hits her head on the gym, all her memories from the past ten years disappear. She thinks she's a twenty-nine year old in love with her husband and expecting her first child. In reality, she's a soon-to-be divorced thirty-nine year old with three kids. Alice must get to know her thirty-nine year old self and try to figure out how she got to where she is in her life. Of course, everyone in her life has also changed in ten years and she has to get used to that as well.<br /><br />I loved the pacing of the story and how the author revealed information about the ten year gap in Alice's memory in bits and pieces. It was suspenseful enough that I could not put the book down but not so suspenseful that I got frustrated. It was also fascinating to read multiple characters perspective on why thirty-nine year old Alice is the way she is. The back cover of my copy says, \"Finally, a smart woman's beach read.\" I think that's a great assessment. Alice is charming, likable and really funny at times like a good chick-lit heroine but this was not a fluffy story - it had some real meat to it.<br /><br />This book had me thinking about for days after I finished it. What would my self of ten years ago think of my self now - not knowing any of the things that have happened to me over the past ten years? I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun AND thoughtful summer read.<br /><br />*** As an aside - there is an infertility subplot that was handled really well. As someone who experienced three years of infertility before my first child was born, I'm extra sensitive to that sort of thing.

{"rating": 5, "title": "there she blows!", "text": "In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick retells the true story of how a sperm whale rammed a whaleship in the early 1800\u2019s and caused one of the most shocking disaster of that time. Unbeknownst to me, the popular story of Moby Dick, which I\u2019m sure many of us have read or heard about during our early school years, was actually based on this story here. I blasted through this book over the weekend because it was just that good! You may not think there\u2019s much to tell of a shipwreck but you\u2019d be dead wrong. The survivors of the Essex whaleship disaster and what they had to endure is nothing short of pure torture of the highest degree and to even fathom how some of them made it out alive is a pure miracle of the highest order. The story has also been made into a movie of the same name starring Chris Hemsworth.<br /><br />\u201cFirst I cry for his departure, then laugh because I\u2019m free.\u201d \u2013 Eliza Brock, Nantucket resident<br /><br />Rather than dive straight into the disaster itself, the author gave a pretty detailed account of Nantucket, the island most famous during its time as the capital of whale oil harvesting from sperm whales. It\u2019s obvious that killing and harvesting an animal for its product can be cruel. However, you should put all bias and opinions aside when reading stories such as this. We must never forget that these events took place almost two centuries ago. Things were a lot different then. The author retells this amazing story through the book and journal accounts of two survivors, first mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson. I found it amazing and oddly eerie that despite the dangers and circumstances they had to go through, the words they choose at certain times to describe the scene and emotions they were going through very poetic and calming.<br /><br />Hunting sperm whales for their oil was literally backbreaking work. Regardless of how one feels about the trade, you can\u2019t deny that it takes a certain amount of courage. The hunters never had any high tech machinery to kill the whales. They relied on hand weapons such as harpoons and lances and that means the need to get up close and personal to the whale in the open sea in your little wooden boat. In addition, when a single voyage means almost being 2-3 years away from your family and friends, one must be physically and mentally fit to go through with it time and time again. In regards to the actual disaster itself and what the men had to go through to survive, you\u2019ll just have to read it to believe it. It\u2019s as simple as that.<br /><br />\u201cWe have been stove by a whale.\u201d \u2013 Owen Chase<br /><br />In the Heart of the Sea makes me appreciate non-fiction books that much more. When they are well written and told, it can beat any fantasy novel. I literally couldn\u2019t put this book down because I just had to find out what happened next. Again, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that just because the men were stranded in the middle of the ocean that \u201cnothing\u201d of importance happens until they were rescued. If you have a goal of reading just one non-fiction book for the year, definitely make it this one. But like the author mentions at the end, just don\u2019t label this an adventure story. It\u2019s a disaster that just happens to be one of the greatest true stories ever told.", "images": [], "asin": "0141001828", "parent_asin": "0141001828", "user_id": "AG4E55UFZJEUMD5DKLC6QVDDDN5Q", "timestamp": 1608019326627, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 3, "title": "A little of the good, the bad and the ugly", "text": "In some ways it is 5-star, in others it is 1-star -- thus the 3 stars. I cannot lie. I found this book difficult to read due to the author's style and odd grammar, but I do find it to be a worthwhile book because it says things that NEED to be said and are not said enough.<br /><br />SOME PROS: This book -- as maddening as it was to read -- caused me to look at my own very different life experience in relation to Jesus in a new way that causes me to think it was not so different from Ms. Tower's after all. I also liked the way she put a good emphasis on treating one another with love and how important that is. This book gave me a whole new appreciation for pastors. I never really realized just how much one person in their church could put them through (sorry Ally, but you leaned on them a LOT...!!!). At the same time, I hope that pastors are the main people who read this book -- because it might help them realize how shunning is truly ineffective. I don't blame the pastors for Ally's problems, but she did trust those pastors like they were family and it was not until they learned to treat her with more acceptance and love that they could all really work to pray together in a way that was good for everyone involved. Her story highlights how easily the clergy can be their own worst enemy when they fear a person having problems rather than trusting God.<br /><br />SOME CONS: Poor editing of this book made it sometimes difficult for me to read. It would have been good for the editor to sit with the author and have her clarify the many sentences she wrote that truly made no sense without having to \"figure it out\" before continuing. I found this to be exasperating at times, but I really wanted to hear her story and plowed through. I often felt she was taking me in never-ending circles as she kept reverting back to where she started over and over. That is, she would reach out to the church, but then get involved more with Wicca. I think what bothered me the most was that although she elaborated (probably too much) on her conversations with different pastors and deacons and their wives regarding her spiritual struggle, she made not one allusion that I can remember to having told the Wiccans she was going to church. I wanted to know more about them and she seemed to protect them from exposure while elucidating about details of the rituals perhaps to prove that it was not \"satanic.\"<br /><br />BUT I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HER -- ANOTHER PRO: My mind kept judging her as I read the book, \"How can she do that? Why is she so wishy-washy?\" when she would reach out to the pastors of her church, have an awakening and feel touched by the Lord Jesus, and then go back into doing a full-out Wiccan ritual. I as stunned as I realized how like her I have been in my own life, (only without a relationship with the church and pastors), and how I strayed from true Christianity for 30 years -- following a guru while also calling myself a Christian and blithely thinking and feeling there was nothing at all wrong with that...!!!  Wow wow wow. I was just like her -- only in a different setting!<br /><br />MORE CONS: It bothers me -- a LOT -- that she quoted so very few Bible passages in this book. People should be told that the Lord makes it clear that sorcery and witchcraft are an abomination in His eyes. I also wonder why in the world the pastors did not quote that passage to her (or if they did, why she chose not to mention it). Which leads me to another important point: the very few Bible quotes she gave were not from the real Bible but from paraphrasing \"bibles.\" I realize that most Christians have NO CLUE that the 200-some \"new translations\" of the Bible are NOT the same Bible that Christians have given their lives to preserve for so many centuries. (Please check out YouTube videos with Gail Riplinger, David W. Daniels and others for more information if you don't want to buy their books on the topic. We are talking about the Word of God here. It is IMPORTANT...!!!!)<br /><br />Last but not least, the author makes it TOTALLY clear that she was never a satanist and rarely thought she was doing anything \"bad\" in Wicca. She spends way too much time defending herself and defending Wicca and for me the cliffhanger of the book was to find out whether she would EVER see and admit that Wicca ultimately IS a tool of the devil. (And the answer is, well, yes and no. She kinda sorta admits it without making it too plain -- apparently because she feels it is too offensive to think of it that way?)<br /><br />It was an exhausting book to read, but I am glad I read it. Actually, I have 10 pages to go before completely finishing the book but have already speed-read through to the end. Some books you wish would never end; this book is one I am very glad ended. I wish the author well and I am glad she is sharing her story -- yet I also feels she would or will be able to write a MUCH superior book once she gets her life and head straightened out a while longer (and starts also learning to read the REAL Bible...!)<br /><br />Last but not least, the author does not seem to understand (or admit) that there really ARE a lot of different types of witches -- and probably also a lot of different types of Wiccans. I found her defense of Wicca to be incessant even though she finally let go of it in the end. I can understand now the reviewer who said s/he got the impression that the author may not have really let go all the way yet.<br /><br />I might question the veracity of the author were it not for the fact she has come out with a second book, FROM THE CRAFT TO CHRIST. I purchased both of them at the same time, and have a feeling I am going to enjoy it very much as it includes the stories of eight other former witches who have come to -- or come back to -- serving our Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you, S. A. Tower. I hope I have not offended you with my blunt review.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Well Written Fictional Portrayal of Early 20th Century Kidnapping", "text": "Andrew Hilleman's &#34;World, Chase Me Down&#34; is an extremely well-written novel, based on the real-life kidnapping of the 16-year old son of a wealthy Omaha meat-packing magnate in 1900 by Pat Crowe and his criminal partner Billy Cavenaugh.  It's told from Crowe's perspective and largely in the form of flashbacks to the period surrounding the crime and the trial five years later, as well as a few glimpses into Crowe's later days (circa 70 years old).  Hilleman is an evocative writer and does an excellent job portraying early 20th century Omaha, Nebraska and Crowe's life on the lam.<br /><br />Pat Crowe--aside from one or two incidents--is a fairly likable criminal and it's the flashbacks to 1900 that are the highlights of this novel.

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good book worth reading because you will gain some insight here.  I just felt it became a bit repetitive at times.  Maybe he was being repetitive to reinforce the fact that attaining mastery requires repetition?<br /><br />I love the layout of the book because it is small chapters on a topic with dozens of notes and stories in the borders of the page.  It works out great for me because I would read a page or two, put it down and come back to it later, which gave me time to let each idea or thought sink in and gave me time to analyze them thoroughly.  I normally go through a book in a day or two, this one took me almost 3 months to read fully. But I think I got a lot more out of it that way.<br /><br />The author breaks up mastery into a few stages, apprenticeship, a creative-active level, and then mastery.  He further breaks down each level in strategies and modes.  Mastery will not come easily, it takes self discipline and perseverance, but it is achievable.  He also talks about something more important, making sure you are trying to gain mastery in the correct area or field.  Life could suck if you gain mastery and then realize it is something you hate to do.  Pick the right area.<br /><br />This book can help at many levels.  There is mastery of a career or maybe just mastery of a hobby or sport.  I used a number of the things I have learned in this book and others and applied it to a hobby of mine, competitive shooting.  I shot for many years achieving a level of just being average.  Then I found an acquaintance at a party who talked about competitive shooting.  He invited me to go shoot with him one day.  I realized that while I was learning at my own trial and error pace it could take me decades to get to his level on my own, or I could see this person as a mentor and knock years off my learning curve.  Since I started training with my friend I have already won two matches in my classification.  I have improved on every level imaginable in this sport and the more I learn, the more I realize there is to learn.  But getting back to the book, I am focusing on some thoughts the author laid out about mastering the basics through effort and practice before trying to move up a level with incomplete or inferior skills.  While I have yet to gain what I consider mastery in this sport, I know for a fact that I am well on my way and will achieve it quicker than if I did not follow the guidance of this book.", "images": [], "asin": "0670024961", "parent_asin": "0670024961", "user_id": "AGJ7II4THZHHSRGJ62ZWUDVDJQGQ", "timestamp": 1393249395000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

It was super sad to read the last in the series.<br /><br />But, as usual, Heather Brewer doesn't disappoint her minions!<br /><br />In The Slayer Chronicles, she tells the story from Joss McMillian & the Slayers' point of view.<br /><br />It doesn't just work--it ROCKS!<br /><br />So many times while reading First Kill I was like, \"Oh, oh, I know...this is xyz from Vlad! Awesome!\" And it was awesome! And the coolest thing is that you could start with Vlad or Joss and be equally as hooked! Have I mentioned how freaking cool this is? I mean, really, it is total author genius here! For real life!<br /><br />OK, but what's the big deal? Well, Joss is a regular kid who is about to go hang out with his awesome cousin for the summer. Then his sister gets killed. In the middle of the night. By a vampire! At the funeral, his creepy uncle tells him to swear that he'll avenge her death. He swears. Fast forward a few years and we learn that, understandably, Joss and his parents have never recovered from the loss. Joss is ignored by his parents, who have just been coasting on auto-pilot since his sister's murder. So when that creepy Uncle Abraham asks for Joss to spend the summer with him doing wilderness survival training, the whole McMillan family goes for it. It is in the mountains that he learns the truth behind the Slayer Society and begins his crazy & often cruel training. Through Joss, we learn the flip side. Not as  much vampires are so awesome, but more of a awww, poor Slayers kind of sympathy. But the way that Joss looks at the world with compassion, empathy, and hatred totally works. Come on, how many people can pull that off?<br /><br />Bottom line: If you loved Vlad, you'll love First Kill. If you haven't met Vlad yet, then you can start with either series (but if you are impatient like me, go for Vlad first because that series has more books!).[[ASIN:0803737416 First Kill (The Slayer Chronicles)]]", "images": [], "asin": "0803737416", "parent_asin": "0803737416", "user_id": "AHHEXI3ZI46GMBXWFWA64MYD4RIQ", "timestamp": 1327964551000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

I started towards the end of the book (chapter 11) because lately I have been engaged in collecting, transcribing, and disseminating written family history articles (letters, journals, and other documents), and I was not disappointed. Barry systematically lays an outline and provides interesting and applicable methods for accomplishing suggested family history tasks.  His work is thorough - and therefore thought-provoking and inspiring.  I have been doing family history work for 15 years and am very organized; Therefore, I was reassured that much of what I have done is in fact very efficient.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Good Read", "text": "**I received an ARC of this story in exchange for an honest review**<br />Michelle is stuck in Temptation, LA, trying to get her grandmother to leave with her as a hurricane is approaching. When she finally gives up, Sheriff Gator Landry shows up in his boat with another attempt at evacuation. Instead, they are all trapped in the house when the hurricane hits. This give both Gator and Michelle time to recall all the feelings they shared 16yrs earlier when Michelle spent a summer with her grandparents. As Michelle stays around for cleanup afterwards, they start to experience the same feelings as before.<br />Michelle, not given the best example of a family, has done well at succeeding at a job she's always wanted and living a life she's happy with. She definitely cares for her grandma and is willing to do what she can for her. Gator is a fairly typical male. He was given a huge responsibility he didn't want, but in the end, he decided to step up to the plate. Having been hurt years before by Michelle, he was afraid to get close to her again.<br />Overall, I really liked this book. The back story of a hurricane and the aftermath are a different plot setting for me and gave me a setting to read about. The only complaint I would have is probably that it was 16yrs and the feelings were just as strong. Given how long it was, that was a little hard for me to buy (7-8yrs would've been better).

I often lose interest in books, even the good ones, so for it to keep my attention was feat in itself. However, I am ambivalent about this book. It kept me reading, mainly due to the technical craft of the writer, more so than to the building of plot or an investment in any of the characters. The main character seemed to show little growth or development as he aged and although I should have had more empathy for him, it was lacking. Theo's narrative style changes little from an adolescent into adulthood, considering the story is supposedly told from the notebooks he kept throughout his life. Due to the character's lack of maturity, by the end I had little compassion for his fate. Was this the writer's intention? Some implausible plot points also added to a lack of my full investment in discovering where things were headed. I've intentionally avoided spoilers, but the one thing I must say is that if you are waiting for things to wrap up nicely, or with any sense of optimism, you will be left unfulfilled.

Author Gerald Luc gushes about this 100 page short as \"having a soundtrack\" because he often mentions particular songs in conjunction with particular scenes.  He also had the audacity to add (supposedly truthful) \"descriptions\" of counter-culture cliques such as hippies, punks, and beatniks; an insult to those of us who actually were alive during these cultural revolutions and took place in them.<br /><br />The drugs?  No one shoots up, a couple of pills are popped, and a little MJ smoking is achieved.  There are no trips and one very lame withdrawal described more like a tequila hangover.  If it's true that you should \"write what you know\", this kid strayed far from that advice.  It's true the prose shows some promising future skill at writing, but the author needs to work on the emotional aspect of his flat and careless characterizations.<br /><br />So what is the book about?  A young man wants to write a book, has a great deal of carnal relationships with several girls, spends a weekend in New York where another teenage carnal fantasy is filled by having a hooker show up at his hotel room.  There isn't much to the book except bland rutting and pipe dreams of youth.  Boring.

However, I think the author is not part of an everyday family with average means and access, and I suspect she doesn't work a typical job in terms of core working hours and flexibility.

I was irked the tone of the book and what I perceived to be the sense that many scenarios families face are clear-cut, black and white choices between right and wrong, good and evil.<br /><br />Much of what she recommends requires you to have lots of spare time and resources. And most of us do not have access to much of what she recommends using/buying. I do realize that if you and your family dive 100% into this process the way she was able to, you will save money, and, therefore, might gather the means to be more flexible and be able to afford this lifestyle. But if you and your family cannot dive in 100%, this process will cost much more in terms of time, energy, resources, and money. I think her family supported her ambition without exception, and that makes the transition to and sustainment of this lifestyle much easier. In reality, though, I suspect that most families will support small aspects--but not most or all--of this lifestyle, so I think many families will wind up leading both lifestyles partway, which is maybe okay to do, but it will take more time, energy, and money to do it. She needs to address that and help the partway families or the families with reluctant members. A more modular approach in the book might have helped a wider cross section of families.<br /><br />She also seems to live in a binary world where a thing is either useful or useless, and it is that one thing to every member of the family unequivocally. What I find to be use/ful/less is subjective, and I'm not the only person living in my household. So her advice about things like decorating is useless and often irritating. Lastly, I can't relate to lots of the recommendations, such as using turkey lacers for toothpicks and getting laser surgery instead of using reading glasses.<br /><br />If the book had approached the transition more incrementally, if it had been framed differently, and if it addressed the typical family in our society, I think I'd recommend it. As is, I think you can learn more from the internet and by reading various facebook groups that support reduction and reuse. I got the book in paper format because I wanted to read it, learn from it, and then share it without the restrictions that kindle-sharing imposes. Mission partially accomplished since I did learn some things from it, but it irked me as much as helped me, and I can't recommend it without reservation.", "images": [], "asin": "1451697686", "parent_asin": "1451697686", "user_id": "AHVOKYUBHNCKQBQZP646S7KUWMCA", "timestamp": 1443898569000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

{"rating": 5, "title": "The lack of horror makes no difference.", "text": "I've said it before and I'll say it again:  even without using any supernatural elements in his stories, Stephen King is a brilliant author.  The strength of his storytelling is in his characters and the first three stories in this book make that very apparent.<br />I've seen the movie SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION a couple of times, so I knew the ending.  Nevertheless, I found this novella to be engrossing.  The first person narration gives the story a personal feel, even if the narrator isn't who the story is really about.  Using this technique, the reader doesn't really get into the head of the main character, but that makes the story all the more intriguing since we don't know what he's planning or thinking or even what his true motivations are.<br />APT PUPIL (I haven't seen this film) was scary because it was so realistic.  We see the characters going from a respectable student and a quiet old man to two people giving in to their base desires.  While one of them welcomes this as a return to things familiar, we see the other one struggle against them, knowing that they are wrong, but not being able to do anything about it.  This is a truly horrific story, but it contains none of King's usual supernatural elements.<br />The third story, THE BODY, is the best in the book.  I've only seen the first twenty minutes or so of STAND BY ME (which is based on this story), so I didn't really know what to expect.  Some of King's best work comes when he is telling coming of age stories of teens or pre-teens.  IT and CHRISTINE were brilliant and I now have to put this story in that category.  No true horror here, just a story about four ordinary friends in middle America spending the last weekend of the summer together.  This is King's trademark brilliant character interaction and development.  The story itself isn't all that exciting, but watching these boys together makes the story a very enjoyable read.<br />Finally, we have THE BREATHING METHOD.  While not as engrossing as the other stories, it does get back to King's supernatural twist at the end.  I enjoyed reading it, but it just didn't grab me the way the others in this book did.  I'm not sure I can really pinpoint why because the characters were just as developed.<br />Anyway, if you're a King fan, you'll definitely enjoy these stories.  If you haven't read King before, don't read these expecting to be surrounded by the macabre.  These truly show off King's strengths as a storyteller by stripping away all the horror and supernatural elements.  He's probably one of the best writers in America today and these stories prove it.", "images": [], "asin": "0451167538", "parent_asin": "0451167538", "user_id": "AEJ3I5PLQYMAWIPEZC2ILPNS7JMA", "timestamp": 1001526840000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

For our daughter who is nearly three, Grandma seems a bit scary, since she doesn't look and act quite like herself. When we visit Grandma, she tends to moan a bit, which is very frightening to our toddler.<br /><br />This beautiful story is about a boy named Bobby and his Grandfather, Bob, who lives with Bobby and his parents. They have a lovely relationship; they spend lots of time together, building with blocks and sharing stories. Bobby especially likes for Bob to tell him the story about how Bobby learned to walk... ''Now one foot, now the other.''<br /><br />When Bobby is 5 years old, Bob has a stroke, and the little boy is frightened by the changes in his grandfather. Once Bob finally gets home from the hospital, he doesn't seem to recognize Bobby. The first sound Bob tries to make ''sounds like a monster'' to Bobby, but Bobby learns to understand Bob and, through love and persistence, is instrumental in Bob's recovery.<br /><br />I'm sure that this book will help my daughter to understand why Grandma isn't quite herself.

{"rating": 5, "title": "My rating: 5/5", "text": "*My review* [MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS]:<br /><br />I am speechless after reading this. It\u2019s because I whole heartedly love this book, which was also the reason why it left me completely entirely heart-brokened. I am not joking when I\u2019m saying whilst reading the last few pages, I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and literally crying hysterically. I must admit I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as emotionally stable right now. I don\u2019t want to spoil the journey but I just want to say Tarryn Fisher is cruel. She is just damn cruel. This book was a straight 6-hour no sleep read for me, I couldn\u2019t stop, even if I wanted to. Trust me I did, I wanted to stop before reaching the final chapter, what I fear would happen had happened. Even though I prepared for the worst, I still couldn\u2019t take it when it finally hit me. I know you\u2019re thinking I\u2019m being dramatic, but no I\u2019m not. Not after this book. Instantly writing this review straight after finishing the book didn\u2019t give me an opportunity for my strong emotions to fade either. I\u2019m trying to keep it fresh for you guys though!<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />The plot was genuinely amazing. How the hell did anyone figure that out? I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going on in that mind of Tarryn Fisher\u2019s. I\u2019ve never read this kind of genre before, for me it wasn\u2019t just a regular NA novel, but \u2018dark\u2019 definitely fits into the category. I may sound like a hypocrite, because I used to mention I loved fairytales and happy endings but I guess the reason I was drawn into this novel was that it was not fairytale material. It portrays the cynicism of people and society, and I would agree is an accurate depiction of the real world we live in. This is by far, one of my favourite group of characters ever. I love how all of them aren\u2019t perfect, but deep down lost in their own waves of betrayal, denial and revenge. The story starts as Olivia regretting her mistake leading to a breakup with Caleb. She knows that Caleb hates her, and never wants to see her again. But what if you get a second chance? Can she start all over again, clean slate? That chance comes to her as Caleb has amnesia due to his accident and no longer remember hers. Opportunity comes and she grabs it. So in love with Caleb, she\u2019s willing to do anything to get him back. These involving the ugly stuff, where tears get spilled, hearts get broken, and love gets lost in the lies, secrets and the dirty plots.<br /><br />Main Characters + actor/actress that I think would fit the role:<br /><br />Olivia Kaspen \u2013 If you\u2019re looking for the kind loving and pretty woman, Olivia\u2019s not it. Well she is pretty, but underneath the pretty face is the eager selfish wolf ready to attack at any moment. Olivia is difficult to describe, she\u2019s like ten girls into one. I would say that she is an emotionally wrecked character, trust isn\u2019t her strong suit due to her past experiences, so she creates a barrier surrounding herself with her cold personality, and pushes anyone possible to coming close to her away, to keep a safe distance. Nevertheless she is someone who definitely gets what she wants and she will make sure it happens.<br /><br />Actress: Jillian Murray<br /><br />Caleb Drake \u2013 You might think he\u2019s perfect. The rich unquestionably handsome and charming man. Close, but not at all what it seems, he\u2019s also a character who\u2019s been through a lot. Because of his unconditional love for Olivia, he has been hurt by her again and again. But even though he\u2019s been hurt countless of times, he still can\u2019t live without her, because it would hurt more. He wanted her as part of his life, anyway possible. It would be unfair to blame it all on Olivia because he did make some s***ty mistakes too. Their relationship was like a ticking time bomb constantly ready for a spark to light the fuel.<br /><br />Actor: Henry Cavil<br /><br />My favourite quotes from the book (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT)<br /><br />\u201cBecause I am a Llama and you are a bird and WE are not compatible.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cI was a relationship retard. I kicked, shoved, and punched people out of my life, so they never had a chance to hurt me.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cI kiss him for all the times I never got to kiss him, and for the times he\u2019s been kissing Leah instead of me. I kiss him because I ruined everything and I could have had this every day.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cA man is only as good as what he loves most right?\u201d \u2013 Caleb<br /><br />\u201cI am so good at pretending, that sometimes I lose track of who I really am.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cI had hurt the person I loved the most, the only person I had \u2013 all to avenge myself. And in the end, I had destroyed myself.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cI think that after the first time you give your heart away, you never get it back. The rest of your life is just you pretending that you still have a heart.\u201d \u2013 Noah<br /><br />\u201cI\u2019m saying that you don\u2019t love him as much as you love yourself.\u201d \u2013 Noah<br /><br />\u201cThere is more to loving someone than just making yourself happy. You have to want him to be happier than you are.\u201d \u2013 Noah<br /><br />\u201cI love you too, Olivia. More than I could ever love another soul. There hasn\u2019t been a single hour in seven years that I haven\u2019t thought of you.\u201d \u2013 Caleb<br /><br />\u201cIt is the last real kiss of my life. I forever cling to that kiss. It was goodbye and I\u2019m sorry and I love you so much.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cCaleb was like a hurricane that swept through my life, stirring up things inside of me that I never knew existed. He is a longing I will never cure.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cLife balances itself on a precarious ledge, we can stay safe up high or propel off the edge.\u201d \u2013 Noah<br /><br />\u201cYou can only give your heart away once; after that, everything else will chase your first love.\u201d \u2013 Olivia", "images": [], "asin": "1482359006", "parent_asin": "1482359006", "user_id": "AGDVU7TJSO5D6UU5K3NWDS6RSZUA", "timestamp": 1412520287000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 1, "title": "This is not sci-fi.", "text": "I finished reading poet's story and reading this book feels like pulling your teeth. So much technical jargon, that after a while you just go with it, without really visualizing what any of them mean.<br /><br />So in the beginning you are introduced to an interstellar war looming: The space barbarians, called ousters are preparing to destroy the world called Hyperion.<br />\"Space barbarians\" - this sounds just wrong on every level. As I think of a barbarian, I picture a bare chest man with a beard and a Viking helmet and two axes running at you screaming, not someone on a spaceship. What a mess! it just sets a wrong precedence early on in this book. Then the further you read the more it feels like this book is based on religion; there are Christianity themes, Islam themes and even Buddhism.<br />So once again - how is this a sci-fi? 7 random characters are assembled for a pilgrimage that all travel on a tree-ship, which sounds like something out of a fantasy book, not a sci-fi, so how are we supposed to take this book seriously?<br /><br />The characters are completely boring, lack of depth and failing to form any emotional connection with a reader. I swear thousands of these \"5-star\" readers must be some religious zealots or something.<br /><br />I read Expanse, Game of Thrones, Some of Neil Asher polity books, some from Alistair Reynolds, Adrian Tchaikovsky, The saga of seven suns, and while some were greater than others, my god all of them at any worst point in them are better than Hyperion.

This book will inspire you to stand for your faith, and to pray for our Christian brothers and sisters around the world each and every day. So many times, we as Americans take our freedom of religion for granted. This book reminded me of the great freedom I have to not only go to church and worship without fear of being arrested, but just owning a Bible is a luxury in some of these countries, and can also be cause for being arrested. Don't take that freedom for granted! There are people who want to take that freedom away. I highly recommend this book.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A decent enough beach read", "text": "This is a fairly interesting book, given the hoopla surrounding it. People have been comparing this to various books, especially Fifty Shades of Grey, due to the book containing a moderate amount of sex scenes. I need to say straight off that I'm not  a Fifty Shades fan, so when I picked this up I was more expecting to find something new to poke fun at.<br /><br />People picking this up hoping that it will contain as many sex scenes as FSoG will be disappointed. Yes, there is sex in the work, but it's nowhere near as prevalent as some of the professional reviews would have you believe. The book *is* liberally sprinkled with sex or references to it, but it's more of an afterthought than anything else and Hilton could have probably removed or reduced many of these scenes without harming the novel. Doing this probably would have worked out well for Hilton, as the critics were right about one thing. The sex scenes are easily the weakest part of the book. They're not awful, but they just feel a bit superfluous at times. It's not Laurell K Hamilton level, where her characters go &#34;OK! STOP - SEXY TIME&#34; (my apologies to MC Hammer) at ridiculous moments, so the book does have that going for it.<br /><br />The characters are OK enough for the most part, although the majority of them just sort of faded in and out of the book. I don't know that I could really name many of the characters outside of Judith and Rupert, as I forgot about many of them once they'd served their purpose in the book. Judith is relatively interesting, as she's far from a likable person but still has some occasional twinges of regret now and again.<br /><br />Maestra really takes off whenever Hilton starts writing about art and the forged paintings, as this is easily the most entertaining stuff in the book and I can't help but wish that there was more of this as opposed to the sex and murder. I like books that have unlikeable, yet compelling lead characters, but this just wasn't quite a four star read for me. It's certainly entertaining and would make for a good beach read, but I can't help but hope that Hilton manages to work out the kinks in part two of the series otherwise I'm not sure that the Maestra series has enough gusto to make a satisfying trilogy.", "images": [], "asin": "0399184260", "parent_asin": "0399184260", "user_id": "AFAAY32MQYRA56IVSVNSCDLNE62A", "timestamp": 1461821150000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

A useful index allows you to pinpoint the exact type of pie you're looking to bake. This book is fantastic, such a great investment.

You don't  have to read the preceding books before reading it but afterwards you might want to.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book one woman's body is found and another woman has gone missing - are the two crimes connected? The author let me feel I was very clever by letting me think  that I'd figured it but then I would be wrong and this happened more than once. One thing I really liked about the author's writing is that even though terrible things happened the author didn't go overboard with graphic details which to me make some books totally unreadable.<br /><br />She also gives a good background and history for the characters but I also felt sometimes this slowed the book down and could have used a bit of editing.  How many times have we been told that juries expect to see evidence presented like on the tv show CSI. Also I didn't need to hear about budget cuts - it's a murder this evidence should be processed first.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book but I felt I would have liked it better as an audio book. I did listen to the audible sample and liked the narrator - when I read it I didn't feel I had the right British accent in my head.

SH, though, had a bigger overall plot involving countries, while GCL's was more compressed on a smaller scale within her own household (stepmother troubles and all that).<br /><br />Oh, and I loved the worldbuilding here. What other fantasy story mentions a pet yak? The kingdom is ruled not by a king but a Kahn! Also, even the religious system is believable and well developed. The traditions, superstitions, history, and music are all well put together and just make the story even better.  And the songs are simple but perfect.<br /><br />Usually, I don't like journal stories, but SH pulled it off quite well. It's even better than The Goose Girl.<br /><br />Writer thoughts<br /><br />Why did journalling work as a medium for this story, but it doesn't work for other stories? Here are my guesses.<br /><br />1, a lot of the conflicts lasted longer than one day. So, none of the danger was over when Dashti was penning the day's activities. She and Saren were still stuck in the tower, still starving. Sometimes Dashti even wrote in her journal while something was happening, and she would pause or sketch or wait in fear in the dark. This made the action feel real.<br /><br />2, inner dialogue and reflections. Dashti often added her own commentary later. Things like, &#34;I shouldn't have thought that about my lady; ancestors, forgive me!&#34; or &#34;Why didn't I say/do this?&#34; or &#34;I'll never forget the way he smells.&#34; It's delightful to read. We experience all her joy and regret with her.<br /><br />3, the journal was a plot point. First, she's chronicling her days in the tower, and the journal would be there to explain why two female corpses are locked in a tower. Later, she's lying about everything, and the journal would get her killed if someone found it. So, it is important. It's like the reader gets to hold a piece of the world.", "images": [], "asin": "1599903784", "parent_asin": "1599903784", "user_id": "AFNLZYLJG75DKOSGOE6X2PYHSE6Q", "timestamp": 1435292444000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 4}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Difficult and Frustrating", "text": "A difficult and frustrating book to read from beginning to end; but what it set out to do, it does with the greatest integrity. Each of the poets, in their own way, uses language, the foundation of communication, to obscure meaning and themselves.<br /><br />The book is representative of many of the current formal presentations in vogue, especially including obstructive line breaks (including prose poems), and various cryptic arrangements of the poetry on the page intended to mystify and repel more than communicate. Every work is strongly redolent of academic seminars and workshops (indeed, many have the imprimatur of academic institutions), and there is very little evidence of life experience or extensive exposure to other poetry\u2014old or new. I strongly suspect that, of the fifty \u201cbest young poets\u201d represented here, none will still be writing poetry ten years from now--unless they're required to by their choice of an academic profession.<br /><br />Obviously, I prefer poetry that is artful communication between the author and the reader/listener. Poems that are accessible, without being intellectually demeaning, and that invite the reader to enter and participate in the conversation, instead of shamed into silence. These are not those; but they do it so deliberately, so consistently that they merit five stars for realizing their strength of conviction.<br /><br />I've followed this series with a great deal of interest.

I didn't have a problem with that. But it drives me crazy to have the intonation of the narration go up at the end of the sentence making everything sound like a question.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Thrilling Debut", "text": "(No Spoilers) Part space opera, part adventure, and applicable to both young adult and adult readers, CassaStar is the thrilling debut novel by Alex J. Cavanaugh, science fiction writer and blogger.<br /><br />Alex has a simple writing style with good flow. I found myself quickly caught up in his prose. CassaStar is written in multiple PoV, limited to the two main characters of Byron and Bassa. Byron is an arrogant, insecure fighter pilot trainee, and Bassa is an experienced instructor with a stern disposition. I loved Bassa, and found Byron off-putting at first (though he does redeem himself). Particularly impressive was Alex's use of the telepathic abilities of Cassans in multiple point of view. At times it was omniscient, but very well done.<br /><br />The world-building in CassaStar is sparse, but intriguing, giving the reader a sense of the setting without inundating us with details. The pages turn quickly and I never found myself growing bored. CassaStar showcases character development in a science fiction atmosphere. It has many exciting moments of space combat, lasers, and explosions, but the core of CassaStar is the progression of Byron and Bassa. How they change and grow.<br /><br />This is one of the best science fiction debuts I have read in a long time. My largest complaint was a lack of female characters. Byron's sister makes an appearance, but it's short and lacks any reader empathy. What do these Cassan women do?<br /><br />Outside of that, CassaStar was a wonderful read that I would recommend to anyone interested in character driven science fiction. If you're a big softy like me, you may cry a bit, so you've been warned. CassaStar sucked me in and held me rapt. I cannot wait to read Alex's next novel and watch his craft steadily improve.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Disappointing and repetitive novel", "text": "I did not finish this book. It was very repetitive and uninteresting. While I was looking forward to reading about Catherine of Aragon - books about Henry VIII typically focus on Anne Boleyn and ignore Catherine's motivations - the execution was poor. First, there were significant implausibilities in the portrayal of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Gregory protrays them as rather open minded and solicitous of Islamic practices. Catherine is portrayed as very appreciative of the Muslim legacy of Spain. This is absolutely ridiculous, considering the fact that Ferdinand and Isabella were brutal religious fanatics who sparked the infamous Spanish inquisition. Second, Gregory portrays the relationship between Catherine and Henry VIII's older brother, Prince Arthur as a love affair. I suppose it is possible, but very unlikely in that time period. Gregory's purpose, of course, is the key premise of this book - that Catherine of Aragon lied when she said that her marriage to Arthur was not consummated, which means that her marriage to Henry was unlawful under church law. However, the efforts to make this point are rather forced - the romance between Arthur and Catherine reads like a nauseating dime store romance", "images": [], "asin": "0743272498", "parent_asin": "0743272498", "user_id": "AEVWJ4AZJF2I6WZ3KRAZOYHZIRAA", "timestamp": 1207180209000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 1}

{"rating": 5, "title": "A dark fantasy read that treats mental disorders with respect and reality", "text": "I'm a hit or miss fantasy reader and I rarely enjoy sci-fi, BUT Edge of the Breach was an absolute hit for me. Where I dislike the genres is within the usual flowery prose or the worlds require me as the reader to suspend too much belief in order to follow a character arc. Yeah. That didn't happen in this book.<br /><br />Halo Scot wrote in a style that I love. While the descriptions were detailed with poetic (oftentimes vulgar poetry, but still elegant poetry) phrases, the style holds a modern taste that draws me in. By using first person points of view, Scot managed to engage me with laughter as well as drawing me into the emotions one feels when dealing with mental health issues such as OCD, depression, anxiety, and autism. Scot avoided overly simplistic summaries of the reactions (from both sides of the disorders--the sufferer and the supporters). Within the fantasy world Scot created, the emotions are very real. At times, it hurt to read, but I couldn't put the book down because I cared about the characters and their pain.<br /><br />Now, about the world within Edge of the Breach. It's fantastic. I mean that. Fantasy and wonderful. The details and rules of the world held. There were no easy or obvious fixes when the story got hard. Part of why I struggle with fantasy is that there tends to be a magical shield or that last moment saving item that appears and saves the day. Scot never went for the easy within this book. Instead, the characters and world stayed in tact. What worked was only through established personalities, skills, and available resources. Nothing easily appeared. There were no cheats. That kept me guessing and at no point did I have the \"oh, I know where this is going\" moment.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I'm already a bit annoyed that the sequel has yet to be written, because I want to know what comes next. That being said, whatever time Halo Scot needs to write the sequel as well as the first book in the Rift Cycle series, it will be worth it.", "images": [], "asin": "B082MR74M1", "parent_asin": "B082MR74M1", "user_id": "AGSH7X4JX2IDPTLQO64AIJQ3EEZQ", "timestamp": 1587665964908, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}
{"rating": 2, "title": "Not My Cup Of Tea", "text": "Though their are a few useful reminders here, I largely did not like this book.<br /><br />My perception is that the author comes to the self help/recovery/personal growth field from a strong marketing (money generating) perspective, which has always rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not saying an author (or a therapist for that matter) doesn't deserve to be well paid. I am saying that I have a problem with a recovery/personal growth specialist making $'s their #1 motivator.<br /><br />One example is much of a chapter plugging something called the &#34;Genius Network&#34;, which per the author costs $25k to join. As the author admits to being a professional blogger & entrepreneur, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a significant referral fee.<br /><br />He also talks about changing one's environment as being essential for success; but many (not all) of his suggestions require money. Some of us don't have a lot of that, & I wish the author's belief that all it takes to get money is to change your attitude was true; I don't find it that simple!<br /><br />He takes the position that &#34;Nature&#34; (genetics) plays a much smaller role in mental health & self realization than &#34;Nurture&#34; which he renames &#34;Environment&#34;, while totally ignoring the fact that in much psychology theory how our parents raised us does have a strong impact, which requires work to change; & is often considered part of Nurture/Environment.<br /><br />I also find it ironic that many of his suggestions for changing one's environment (& I agree with some of his thoughts on that; especially removing unhealthy people from my life) require a ton of Willpower; which the book's main theme states doesn't work!<br /><br />I'm aware that all other reviewers as of the time of this review hold this book in higher regard than I do, your mileage may vary.

{"rating": 4, "title": "A nod to the Ravenloft books I loved so much growing up", "text": "PALADIN UNBOUND was an exciting and fast-paced break following immediately on the heels of the intense marathon read that was Dragon Mage. There are certain books that hit at just the right time and I didn't know how much I needed this story until I sat down and began reading it. Part quest fantasy, part dark adventure, with a splash of vampires and horror thrown in the mix, and this story turned out to be such a cool blend of so much of what I love in a killer read.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about this book is the fantastic worldbuilding. Evelium is very much a wondrous traditional fantasy setting but with a dark edge that hints at a tumultuous and deadly past. We get glimpses of the history of this world at the beginning of each chapter by way of snippets taken from historical texts. It's alluded to that these texts were uncovered over the years by way of excavations. I really liked this technique because it provided a valuable context to the story without it feeling like info-dumping.<br /><br />This book also deals a good deal with prejudice and stereotypes. The main character Umhra is a half-blood orc who often encounters derision and suspicion wherever he goes. Life isn't easy for he and his band of mercenaries as many jobs go to a more \"acceptable\" segment of clients. It's extremely surprising then when he is given the delicate mission of finding out what happened to a group of well-placed and respected dignitaries/soldiers who may have ventured into cursed Telsidor Keep only to then not return. Why assign this task to Umhra? Why now? Could it be because he and his cohorts are seen as expendable, or is there a deeper and more significant reason?<br /><br />Once the mission gets under way this story really takes off and becomes a breakneck dark adventure fantasy to the thrilling final page. This is a truly delightful multi-faceted story that took me places that I wasn't expecting. I think that the addition of some horror elements gave this one a very Ravenloft feel, which hearkened back to my glory days of devouring those books one after another when I was first cutting my teeth on fantasy as a genre.<br /><br />Suffice to say that Jeffrey Speight has written a wonderful first book that bodes incredibly well for future volumes. I had an absolute blast reading this and the story hit me with all the nostalgic feels that makes this such an entertaining experience from start to finish. Pick up this book if you love quick reads that grab your attention right from the jump and never let go. I can't wait to read the next book that Speight puts out because PALADIN UNBOUND, although entirely satisfying and amazing, left me wanting more of this type of story.

I would say that this book is not for everyone due to the portrayal of necrophelia.  Short chapters, great prose (the local language, setting, descriptions etc.) and pacing.  I simply kept wanting to read.  What next?  The subject matter is quite sad.  The 27 yr old Lester Ballard of Sevier Co., Tennessee has lost everything in his life.  His mother ran away, his father hung himself, the county auctioned off his property, the house he is squatting in burns to the ground.  His bootlegger cannot even remember where he hid his &#34;shine.  Lester ends up in the dead of winter living in a cave.  Lester is alone in the world, he cannot relate normally to other humans.  The isolation drives him mad.  He lives alone with stuffed animals and dead bodies.  He prowls the countryside.  When he comes to town for supplies he seems unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  (The chapter with the blacksmith is when you know Lester is simply in another world.)  The law has it in for him.  He's tagged as a troublemaker.  However, he does seem to be able to communicate with some of the hill people who are also rather isolated.  Perhaps all his problems began to accelerate with a severe blow to the head.  (McCarthy implies same.)  This book was written more than 40 yrs ago and it remains a powerful statement.  It is my understanding that the actor/director James Franco made a movie out of the book.  Anyway, I much enjoyed this &#34;horrible&#34; little book.

And there were some really good moments in the storyline and an abundance of strong characters.<br /><br />I still found the book to be a bit frustrating and unsatisfying though. In some ways it gave too much and it was overkill. Like Logan, our hero, was way too much of everything. Not only has he inherited a valuable, beautiful ranch but he's also an ex rodeo star, has served in the special forces in Iraq, started his own dot.com company (and became a millionaire off it) AND he had time to go to law school. Wow. To go to law school you first have to get your Bachelor's.... so he's been in school for 4 to 7 years (depending) and still managed to do these other things?<br /><br />Yet none of these roles are ever really defined. He starts to sorta get into the ranching thing... but that is the only thing he doesn't have experience in, ironically. (When he was a kid on the ranch, they didn't use it as a ranch, his family were loggers?) I'm not sure why the author felt the need to make Logan SO MUCH but still sorta nothing. Because he doesn't get to wear any of his hats at all.<br /><br />In comparison, Briana, the heroine, is the opposite. She really has no history, except for her famous father, and no hobbies, besides reading. She's uneducated and has a routine management job, her first, at a casino. She seems to be a wonderful mother but doesn't have a clue in many ways. It's interesting that author made the hero so incredible and experienced and adventurous and made the heroine so boring.<br /><br />Then in other ways the author just didn't give enough in the plot. Like there's a suspense plot introduced that never really pans out. Seems awfully coincidental the way it ends too. And it's not even really closed up completely. I can't really argue this point without giving away spoilers so I'll leave it to the reader! And why the ominous overtone from the Indian grandmother that never pans out? What did the election have to do with anything? Basically the story just left me feeling like it was incomplete.<br /><br />BUT even still I did really enjoy the characters. I loved Logan's inner thoughts- he's all male. I really liked Jim, Briana's boss. The kiddos are pretty cute too. Hey, I even enjoyed reading about Vance, the ex. And the book carries a wholesome, Montana awesomeness that was irresistible. I rated it 3 stars because it kept my attention the whole time and I really enjoyed it.

I know it sounds a bit strange but I enjoyed the simplicity and unpretentiousness of the projects but at the same time I didn't like those same attributes because as a quilter they seemed so basic and something only a beginner would be interested in. Am I likely to make any of the 16 little quilts in the book?  Probably not but then maybe because part of the charm (and challenge) of the projects is that they are small. The cover quilt Little Strippy, for example, is 12 3/8&#34; x 15 1/8&#34; and the finished blocks within it are only 1 1/2&#34;! The biggest quilt Scrap-Box Strip is 26 3/4&#34; x 36 1/4&#34; and is simply a larger version of the cover quilt. Another larger quilt Scrappy Pinwheels is 20&#34; x 26&#34;. Most of the other projects run in the 15&#34; to 18&#34; range but there is one that finishes at 11&#34; square and another 12 1/2&#34; square. There is one runner that measures 6 1/8&#34; x 17 1/2&#34;.<br /><br />Quilt blocks include 4 patches, 9 patches, flying geese (using flipped corners), 2 applique projects (1 with hexagon flowers), pinwheels, modified log cabin, and square in a square.<br /><br />The book is well written and I enjoyed Kathleen's discussion about earlier quilters, fabric storage and fabric variety. Quilting suggestions are given but I found them very simplistic almost primitive style even for these little projects. I didn't read it in the book but the quilting of the projects looks like it may have been by hand. I guess if I were hand quilting these projects (I've done very little hand quilting) then I'd appreciate keeping the quilting simple.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the publisher had used a larger print font.

{"rating": 5, "title": "\"Get rid of the money\": it worked, at least this once", "text": "What if rock and roll was taken as seriously as jazz? Paul McCartney, at Cass Elliot's house in 1967, discussed this with The Mamas and the Papas' John and Michelle Phillips, and their manager Lou Adler. A few nights later, this shifted into what became the first mass concert, thirty or so acts over three June days in The Summer of Love, that raised funds for charity. This carefully documented, well-illustrated history, interspersed with reminiscences from musicians, participants, planners, and fans, brings this festival into the spotlight, where often it has been overshadowed by the far-more hyped and arguably less-successful Woodstock. Editors Harvey and Kenneth Kubernik note that Monterey Pop as a non-profit enterprise generates music scholarships, academic endowments, and healthcare for musicians over forty-four years and counting.<br /><br />Guided by Beatles publicist Derek Taylor and Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham, and supervised by a \"board of governors\" listing McCartney, Adler, John Phillips, Mick Jagger, Terry Melcher, Johnny Rivers, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon, Donovan, and Brian Wilson, their combined clout meant that they could invite the best in the business to perform--for no profit but guaranteed first-class expenses. Taylor wryly noted in the concert's program: \"Entertainers who have starved and become rich are forever haunted by guilt.\"<br /><br />This narrative, and often orally transcribed, history follows the concert from planning to promotion to production, and reads as if the script of a generously funded documentary, moving efficiently while showing visual elements and musical summaries that invite one to seek out the first rock concert film, D.A. Pennebaker's \"Monterey Pop\" (1968), or the four-CD Rhino Records (1997) box set of the music, to accompany the pages and photos.<br /><br />Pennebaker sums up Lou Adler's genius: \"Get rid of the money.\" Trouble was, Owsley Stanley's \"Monterey purple\" acid distributed freely contributed to lots of unease as well as some great, or failed, performances on and off stage. Pennebaker's efforts to capture the atmosphere cannot have been helped by lighting director Chip Monck's lysergic condition, for all he registered as a color, he testifies, was red. Pennebaker was told by Janis Joplin's then-manager to aim the camera at the ground when Big Brother stunned the crowd during their scheduled performance, Saturday afternoon. He tried, cowed by goons, but he caught enough to convince the singer and her band to come back and play the next night. They became stars.<br /><br />The Who would trash their equipment, and Jimi, who won the coin toss with Pete Townshend, would follow with lighting his guitar on fire after seducing, or assaulting, it.  Ravi Shankar left after The Who: \"My feelings were hurt deeply, as well as my respect for music and the instruments. We ran away from the festival.\" Roger Daltrey counters--after noting how Hendrix copied a lot of his Monterey stage act from Townshend, adding to it \"genius\" and not only musical but theatrical inspiration--how his band was hustled away. \"We reminded them how the world was in a s--t state, that it wasn't peace and love at all [laughs].\"<br /><br />Part of the appeal of this book is finding out about the less-heralded moments. Mike Bloomfield tells of his band The Electric Flag: \"Probably the biggest gig we ever played. And we played rotten, man, I ain't jiving you. We really sounded lousy. And the people loved it. And I could see--oh my God, the hype, the image, the shuck, the jive.\"<br /><br />Laura Nyro left in tears, in a black evening gown dress out of place among patchouli and paisley, thinking she'd been booed off stage. Near her death decades later, Adler and Pennebaker working on a DVD of the concert found out that she had not. Tape analysis verified what sounded like \"boo\" was \"beautiful.\"<br /><br />No follow-up occurred although the city approved one; by July 1968, violence had scarred much of the world beyond this tony resort and military town on the peaceful Californian coast below the Bay Area. Still, as curator Marisa Mercado notes accurately, the notoriety of the counterculture left its municipal mark. A few stayed, as the Bay Area's vibrations reverberated and then faded. \"Hippies became homeowners. In the end, Monterey solidified as that charming tourist town that people love to visit, but can't afford to live in.\"", "images": [], "asin": "1595800603", "parent_asin": "1595800603", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1321322814000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

I have one grandson and was relocated to Orlando by my son and her to help with his care two months prior to his birth. After 2.5 years of caring for My Little Precious, I was fired for \"not following directions\". Denied any access to my grandson, I had a mini-stroke. I had to stay with them for a few months as a result of my health change and loss of independence. I've since been placed in a retirement community, 95% Caucasian residents, 15 to 25 years older than I am. Despite my love for my grandson and his love for me, they refuse to let me see him. They don't want him to love me and have done everything possible to turn him against. This is a horrible existence, not to see my grandson and to have to accept the experience of my son's toxic marriage through being abandoned and unloved. She is most happy with what she's accomplished. My son is a Psychologist and is unable to see his situation. Reading this book, I was not surprised by the behave of the German Officer, other officers, the confessions of those interviewed. I know the full measure of the German Aryan heart and how far it will go to destroy and love it light in its path. I am glad Trust found out about her lineage. My grandson will never know mine. I will not be saved by love, not by those I love.", "images": [], "asin": "B003IEJZV0", "parent_asin": "B003IEJZV0", "user_id": "AENSQTHN6WIZAXOW6TUMX5HTI5GQ", "timestamp": 1504086413802, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 1}

A local teenager approaches him, wanting help locating a missing brother. Cal agrees, and immediately faces strong resistance from the rest of the village, raising questions about what they're collectively hiding.<br /><br />Like with anything Tana French has done, the writing is beautiful. The imagery of the small Irish town is so vivid, and I loved the way the dialect is written, you can't help but feel you're really there with the characters. I also liked the way she interspersed Cal's backstory in, it wasn't a major focus but it provided some great flavor to his character.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed the process of reading it, I did ultimately feel like there was not a lot of payout at the end, especially compared to some of her other works.

It was an easy read, but there are elements of the story that didn't flow well, and the characters can be hard to like.  But, I enjoyed the premise, and thus found the entire story enjoyable.<br /><br />Andrea was hard-headed and extremely stubborn.  For the most part this benefited who she was and what she wanted to do.  She's not the princess we usually see in fairy tales.  She has no desire to learn to be a lady and would be considered a tomboy (and that's putting it mildly).  But there were times I really wanted to yell at her.  She has a habit of thinking something was a great idea and going with it.  She doesn't bother to think about the consequences and how her actions might effect others.  I think so many things could have been avoided if she would just stop and ask herself a couple questions before proceeding.  But then we wouldn't have much of a story.<br /><br />The supporting cast of characters was a mix.  John was an interesting character when he was in California.  Stick him in Andrea's world and all of a sudden he became the guy I wished would disappear.  He thought it was all a game and so he never realized what was at stake.  Andrea's father...I disliked immensely.  He was just as stubborn as Andrea and wanted such a different life for her.  Not to mention that he was such a man in so many ways.  I loved Don Julian and his brother Alfonso.  They both brought a lot of life to the story.  I had a feeling there was something more to Don Julian and was glad to discover in the end that I was right.<br /><br />I actually didn't care much for that part were Andrea is in California.  I didn't find in believable that she managed to fit in there so easily and in so little time.  I don't think a princess who leaves in a mid-evil like era could come to modern California, fit in, learn English, etc all in a few months time.  But, it was necessary to the story.  She learns about who her ancestors could have been (they are suppose to have crossed over from our world centuries ago).<br /><br />An interesting story overall.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Cute paranormal cozy", "text": "Witchnapped in Westerham is the first book in the Paranormal Investigation Bureau series (currently up to book 9) by Dionne Lister. Released 16th July 2018, it's 218 pages and available in paperback and ebook formats.<br /><br />This is a cute, undemanding, paranormal cozy. Main character Lily is a photographer and *surprise* a witch. She finds out more about her own and other's powers when a strange Englishwoman appears on her doorstep and drags her off to England to help find her kidnapped brother who, it turns out, is a colleague of the aforementioned woman, exploring crimes with a paranormal angle.<br /><br />The plotting is simple, undemanding, and the plot twists are unlikely to surprise many readers. The dialogue is often silly and/or snarky. There's also a hunky antagonistic detective who provides the necessary slow burn romantic element. I liked reading about the magical elements and the limits of the various characters' talents (they vary).  The denouement was a little surprising; the 'whodunnit' aspect won't come as a shock for many (any?) readers.<br /><br />One quibble from me... It made my eye twitch on page 163 to see the author use \"infer\" when she clearly meant \"imply\". The book is self published and likely self-edited, but it did make me wince.<br /><br />This is a nice easy entertaining paranormal cozy. I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received an ARC at no cost from the author/publisher for review purposes.", "images": [], "asin": "B07DJ99RBF", "parent_asin": "B07DJ99RBF", "user_id": "AHS7O4ONEBZLCU7YLOSLSV72N2IA", "timestamp": 1574446983701, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

It never grabs you and pulls you in like a good story; it hops around from past to present before one has a decent grasp of the characters or the proper investment in finding out where the story is going and what's going on. I gave it two stars because the author's turns-of-phrase are evocative and his sentences, as individual entities, are well-crafted.

I\u2019m going to start by saying that I\u2019m ...", "text": "This book\u2026 was amazing!<br /><br />I\u2019m going to start by saying that I\u2019m not usually a fan of epic historical fantasy it\u2019s just too much for me to ingest and this cover just screams it with that dragon\u2026 but I knew I had to give it a try when I read it was touted as Pride & Prejudice meets dragons, wyverns and warriors!<br /><br />From the very first page I was pulled into this story, and yes you get hints of the P&P elements in both the plot and characters, but White has created her own story here filled with fantasy and imagination. It\u2019s both familiar and something completely new and wondrous.<br /><br />Aliza Bentaine lives at Merybourne Manor with her parents and sisters\u2026 the manor has recently come under attack by a pack of gryphons, including an attack that took the life of one of her beloved sisters. Aliza is our Elizabeth here\u2026 she\u2019s quiet but loyal and loves her sisters and family, and she would do anything to keep them safe so the loss of her sister is heartbreaking. She\u2019s reassured though when Lord Merybourne decides he has no choice but to hire a group of Riders to come rid the grounds of the gryphons and so arrives Alastair Daired.<br /><br />Alastair is our Darcy equivalent character and dare I say he\u2019s exactly who I had hoped he would be. Descended from a legendary warrior, Edan the Fireborn, he is a dragonmaster and cranky and grumpy and everything you would expect he might be. Of course it doesn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s also handsome. From the get go Alastair and Aliza butt heads and disagree on so many things, but the predicaments they are forced into also build a level of trust and admiration between them.<br /><br />But not only are our main characters well done, the secondary characters are wonderfully developed\u2026 from Master Brysney to Anjey, Leyda & Mari I loved getting to know each of them, and their parts of the story were just as developed as Aliza and Alastair. I also really enjoyed the development of all of the relationships in this story\u2026 from the sisters to the riders, their stories kept me turning pages and again you get hints of P&P here in the relationships that develop, but they are still totally unique!<br /><br />Of course there is some romance\u2026 there are moments you will definitely swoon and if you\u2019re like me, you can\u2019t help but cheer for Aliza and Alastair as they learn that maybe they aren\u2019t the person they originally thought each other were and learn more about what makes them who they are. Let\u2019s just say my shipper heart was super happy\u2026 even if I did want some more kissing.<br /><br />I mentioned that there are dragons in this story and I have to tell you that I loved them\u2026 I loved the history that White has created for them, and I really loved their role in this story. But dragons aren\u2019t the only fantastical creature here\u2026 White introduces us to so many others and the world-building around them was wonderfully done.<br /><br />It makes me sad to say that this is a stand-alone, because I selfishly want more! I will be looking forward to anything that White will be writing in the future. With excellent world-building, action-packed story-telling, and incredibly developed characters and relationships, I\u2019m excited to get this on my all-time favorites bookshelf!", "images": [], "asin": "0062451944", "parent_asin": "0062451944", "user_id": "AEN5SFCSO5L4XDEHZ7B4LYYICXJQ", "timestamp": 1493587046000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

But I checked out the book because Shannon Hale \u2013 and, I suppose, Dean and Nathan Hale, too \u2013 had written it, and I loved (and still love) Shannon Hale. I was charmed by the story and resolved to pick up \u201cCalamity Jack,\u201d the sequel. It\u2019s taken years, but I finally have, and I must say I was underwhelmed. It\u2019s a fun story with some great art, but I wasn\u2019t really into the characters and was only marginally interested in the plot.<br /><br />This graphic novel explains the origins of Jack, Rapunzel\u2019s sidekick, better known to us as the Jack who cut down the beanstalk. Jack\u2019s a good kid \u2013 he thinks. He only wants to help his struggling mother keep her restaurant afloat, but he does it in less than honorable ways \u2013 planning heists, for example, with his fairy friend Prudence. But when he tries to break into a giant\u2019s abode with the help of some magic beans, he ends up fleeing town, meeting up with Rapunzel, and having all the adventures we hear about in \u201cRapunzel\u2019s Revenge.\u201d<br /><br />Now, Jack wants to head home and give his mother the golden eggs he finally got the giant\u2019s goose to lay. However, his old city has been overrun by ant people, and the giant he stole from has seized control. The giant claims he\u2019s the only one who can keep the ant people at bay, but Jack\u2019s gut tells him something funny\u2019s going on, and he\u2019s right. With the help of Rapunzel, Prudence, and a new friend, Frederick Sparksmith the Third, Jack might finally be able to redeem himself.<br /><br />\u201cCalamity Jack\u201d was just as cute as \u201cRapunzel\u2019s Revenge,\u201d but I can\u2019t say I enjoyed it as much. There were more than a few plot points that didn\u2019t make sense, and the characterization, though often amusing, seemed forced this time around.

She is not content to just watch the dvd, drool a little, and then put it away. Jane is obsessed. Her constant failed relationships are proof of that.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Wow what an awesome book!", "text": "I think I liked this even better than Circe, which was a surprise because I never really liked the Achilles myth. But now I know why. EVERY other time someone else has retold Achilles in any way he still comes out as an egotistical monster. But this version attempts to give him depth and emotions.<br /><br />We see and learn of Achilles through Patroclus who ends up becoming his childhood companion. They learn, play and spend a lot of time together. He accompanies Achilles to his training with Chiron, where they both finally admit that they have feelings for each other and are attracted to each other.<br /><br />But war is on the horizon, drawing the two away. Achilles mother kidnaps him, forcing him to marry a woman and to bed her, in an attempt to keep Achilles from Troy and from Patroclus. But Patroclus finds him and they are both found by Odysseus and taken to Troy. Achilles knows his fate, that Troy will bring his own death if he kills Hector but he can't imagine why he would.<br /><br />War is awful. Achilles takes to it easily but Patroclus doesn't. Instead he helps as a doctor and helps save the women often taken as slaves. He has no interest in fighting until Achilles lets his own pride in the way, costing people their lives and safety. Patroclus comes up with a plan, with Achilles approval, he will dress up as Achilles and unite the men in show only and Achilles can keep his promise to not fight until an apology is given to him. But Hector kills Patroclus anyway, even though he can tell he isn't Achilles. Achilles takes revenge and thus cements his own death.<br /><br />What is even more sad is how no one will honor Patroclus in his death. Their ashes are mingled but Achilles stupid son won't let them carve Patroclus name on the monument because he refuses to acknowledge that his father was gay. Patroclus begs Odysseus to fix things, but he can't. Achilles own mother ends up carving Patroclus name and reuniting them in the afterlife.<br /><br />Achilles has his ego and he definitely is imperfect. Patroclus is great. Most of the other men suck to some degree and Achilles mother is awful because honestly if she hadn't hated Patroclus so much maybe the story would have had a different ending. Also Achilles son sucks.", "images": [], "asin": "0062060627", "parent_asin": "0062060627", "user_id": "AFA4ULAX2OCPIAD37ADWIG5EJDRA", "timestamp": 1663882286235, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Classic Liberal Review: Proofiness is a bit Proofy.", "text": "This book is politically loaded, so let me jump right out here so you all know where I'm coming from (and that I'm not trying to hoodwink anyone). I am a Classic Liberal or Lockean/Madisonian. So with that in mind I'm not a Republican or Democrat, and like to see people held accountable for their lies (or abuse of information).<br /><br />First, I'd like to say that the book started off quite fun and interesting. Seife is light with the mathematics (a bit of a downer for an engineering student like me), but he still pulls off a relatively decent explanation of numbers, systems of measurements, and the like. The first half is very accessible; it is at worst entertaining, at best, clever. Some other reviewers took issue with the neologisms, I personally didn't mind them, but perhaps being an educated late-20s, I am perhaps the target market for this kind of writing?<br /><br />However, as it got further into the book, Seife started violating some of his own implicit rules (such as: Journalists are unbiased, or should strive to be if possible.).  This made the book incredibly distracting and not particularly fun to read towards the end. Personally I would argue that chapters 7 & 8 got out of hand. For example, in closing out chapter 7 he states,<br /><br />\"The sheer number of errors in our courts make the finality of an execution-of an irreversible mistake-hard to justify. The only way around that hard fact is to pretend it isn't so.\"<br /><br /> Wait a second, I thought Seife was trying to show me how people are abusing numbers to push agendas, right? So why is he saying this? It couldn't be that he is an opponent of capital punishment, could it? I mean, he's the mathematician, and he just educated me on how a pro-capital punishment fellow tried to trick us, so therefore the opposite conclusion (anti-capital punishment) must be correct! Seriously... a \"false dilemma\" (also called \"either-or\" fallacy)? Goodness I don't even hold a bachelor's yet and I can see through that over simplification.<br /><br />Later in chapter 8 he brings up some nonsense about a study that compared a Toyota Prius to Hummers. I do tend to agree that the study was conducted to make the Hummer brand look favorable, so I won't even try to argue against intent. I think most will agree that Hummers probably don't rate very high on the scale of being \"green.\"  However, Seife decided to take a detour anyways through a small evaluative argument right in the middle of chapter 8 without much backing. He states,<br /><br />\"(This was nothing compared to the Hummer H1, which would be on the road for an incredible 34.96 years and 379,000 miles on average.) These are clear Potemkin numbers-there's no way that the typical Hummer H1 would last for nearly 400,000 miles-and they have the effect of inflating the energy efficiency of the Hummers and deflating the energy efficiency of the Prius.\"<br /><br />Now, I don't doubt the goal of the study was to make the Hummer look more \"green\" than it actual was, especially because it was compared to a \"green\" auto icon. However, the statement that there is \"no way that the typical Hummer H1 would last for nearly 400,000 miles\" is completely unfounded. I have found the reverse to be true. I used HMMWVs (aka humvees) in the Marine Corps. The difference between a Hummer H1 and HMMWV is streetability, mostly cosmetic differences. Functionally they are the same vehicle. Many of the HMMWVs we used were mid to late 80s models; the infantry usually got the newer stuff. Our models had in many cases in excess of 500K miles, there were a few dinosaurs lying around in awful shape near the 1 million mark. My point here is that Seife probably had a reasonable conclusion (that Hummers are less \"green\" than Prius). But he was so hasty in getting to his point to show that pundits had abused the data (also likely reasonable and true), that he made some mistakes with the premise along the way. If he had shot down the study just by simply pointing out that the average auto consumer buys a new car once every 3 - 5 years, and given that length of time, likely that no Hummer would ever match the efficiency of a Prius, this would have been reasonable.<br /><br />To summarize, I found the book readable and interesting. I thought it started great and ended horribly. I'm under the impression that Seife leans very Democratic but the writing strikes me as being just left of center. It's worth at least one read, but whether as a permanent addition to your collection or just a library rental I leave to you.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Not all that I'd hoped...", "text": "This year we switched to this curriculum, Christian Kids Explore Biology, and I tried again to find a Christian science curriculum that we would like and that would be easy to use.<br /><br />I liked the philosophy of this author and many of the points she draws out in the lessons.  But, unfortunately, after two lessons, I quickly realized that there were lots of holes in the curriculum and it was difficult for my kids to follow auditorily.  There is no student book and the text would be way above their reading level if I were to copy it for them (which isn't legal since the text portion of the book isn't reproducible).  I worked through several lessons and assembled additional materials and supplements so that the curriculum would be what I thought it should be.<br /><br />Here's a quick example.  Instead of clearly saying, &#34;There are two types of cells:  Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic.  Animal and Plant cells are both eukaryotic, but they have some differences.&#34;  The book says on page 8, &#34;Eukaryotic cells have a particular organelle inside called the nucleus...  and on pg. 9, &#34;Some cells do not have a nucleus.  They are called prokaryotic.&#34;  No examples are given of what a prokaryotic cell would be.  Then the assignment asks kids to label an animal cell and a plant cell, before first saying that both of these cells are eukaryotic because they have a nucleus.  That was Lesson 2 in Unit 1.  Honestly, I love the stuffing of this curriculum, but there just isn't enough of it and there are statements that are missing so that me (a non-science lover) can teach it easily.  I was constantly running to the internet so that I could thoroughly explain the lessons to my kids.  I had to clarify that there weren't more than two types of cells.  I also wanted my kids to know the word &#34;mitosis&#34; which wasn't mentioned in the lesson at all.<br /><br />So, where does that leave me?  The reason I had switched because of my concerns about evolution and natural selection and how that teaching permeates secular science curriculum.  I've looked for a curriculum that I like as well as Harcourt Science.  Now I've tried two and have looked at many others.  But Harcourt Science works for my kids and it works for me.  As my oldest daughter said to me today.  Mommy, &#34;I know creation is the truth, but I like this book and how it teaches.&#34;  So, I'm switching back through 6th grade and will find another curriculum to use for 7th grade and beyond...<br /><br />As a side note, make sure you either get a copy of this book with a cd of the reproducible pages or you purchase a download of the reproducibles from the publisher's webpage if you're going to use this curriculum.

The story is predominantly sedate, with two men working in the gold storage area of Fort Knox.

As to what that tone is, I'll quote Lila, from Marilynn Robinson's (much better) book of that name: &#34;[He looked] at every single thing in the world as if it had a price tag on it and he knew it wasn't worth half that much because he could see what the paint hid, where the rot was.&#34; (p 243).

{"rating": 4, "title": "Epic Alternative Historical Fantasy", "text": "I've just finished reading the whole of this series, and so will write a review on that basis, beginning with the prequel.  This is a totally captivating series.  I wasn't sure, when I picked up the first one, whether I would become all that interested in Welsh medieval history. No worries there.  The author is a scholar in this field, and knows this history completely.  In these books, she hypothesizes about what would have happened if certain events had not taken place, or had taken place differently.  In short, she rewrites Welsh history.  In a very satisfying way.<br /><br />The world of these books is not simply a reimagining of history.  She includes time travel, and other paranormal stuff.  It all makes perfect sense, though, and you very quickly come to accept the premise.  Although she never attempts to explain how these things happen, it doesn't seem to matter.<br /><br />I also like the way she wove the King Arthur myths into this story.  I wasn't aware that she was doing that until the second or third book, and it was a great pleasure to recognize the theme.<br /><br />Her characters are flesh and blood.  We come to care about them fast, and understand their motivations.  In particular, she spends time on detailing the motivations of the secondary adversarial figures, as well as the leads.  This gives her books a depth that you don't always see, especially in books that are classified as YA.  These books are most definitely crossovers.  They will appeal to all adults.  The writing is mature enough, and the issues and events feel very real.<br /><br />I don't know whether the author intends to write any further about these characters.  I loved them, and would like to see that happen.  She's ended her story here, in a way that allows you to move on, even while wanting more.  I'd recommend these books to just about anyone who likes fiction with a fantasy angle.  Despite the time spent on the history, it is not dry.  The author has created a world that is blazingly alive.<br /><br />I went back and forth about the rating, wanting to give it a \"5 Star\", but, since I couldn't decide, gave it \"4\".  There were some aspects of the story that didn't feel completely finished.  If she continues it, I will probably rerate it.", "images": [], "asin": "B004SQSMV6", "parent_asin": "B004SQSMV6", "user_id": "AFDAIDJSCJ4BYWUC6Q2JEI43Y2JQ", "timestamp": 1346104563000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

While petite Evaline is physically strong and highly impulsive, ready at a moment\u2019s notice to barge in bashing heads and staking hearts, ungainly Mina is instead methodical in temperament, analytical in thinking, and clumsy in movement.<br /><br />In spite of their differences, Mina and Evaline are both intent on unmasking and capturing The Ankh, an evil villainess they\u2019ve been chasing since the first book, but Irene Adler (boss to Mina and Evaline, and \u201cThe Woman\u201d to Mina\u2019s Uncle Sherlock) and  Princess Alexandra have asked (ordered) them to spend their time chaperoning Princess Lurelia of Betrovia instead.The highly delicate diplomatic situation between Betrovia and Britain dates back to Elizabeth I and involves love, betrayal, secret treasure, and the mysterious missing piece of an elaborate chess set. It\u2019s important that Princess Lurelia be coddled and protected at all costs lest the two countries have another falling out, but the Princess is attacked almost at once, at the ball in her honor of her visit.<br /><br />This series is silly, suspenseful, occasionally moving, and a lot of fun. I love the sometimes irritated banter between Mina and Evaline, and I enjoy seeing the world through their very different perspectives. I really adore the setting. The the two young women inhabit a colorful, Victorian, steam-powered London that would make a great travel destination. It\u2019s a city layered with multi-leveled walkways connected by coin-driven mechanical lifts that keep those who are short on funds down below. While the higher levels of this London are amazing, gleaming, and gorgeous, complete with clever clockwork devices, animated twinkling lights, and the opulent upper floors of  skyscrapers so tall they have large balloons to act as air anchors, the lower levels of the city are dirty, dank and dark, and the haunt of criminals.<br /><br />The Chess Queen Enigma doesn\u2019t end in a cliffhanger, but several things are left unresolved, leading me to hope there will be a fourth book.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Looking At Art For The Predominant Colors Used & The Feelings They Emote", "text": "Art Unfolded: A History of Art in Four Colours made me feel as if I was attending one of the author- Ben Street\u2019s lectures in London. This is a small book- 6 \u00bd\" by 5\" with a mere 42 pages and also having 4 pullout pages that hold a dozen paintings each showcasing the four colors explained.  Each of the dozen paintings for the four different colors also has a full page detailing the artist\u2019s background, the times and the predominant colors used. The paintings chosen were from Western civilization\u2019s great artists from the 14th to 20th centuries, and were chosen for this book from London\u2019s National Gallery.<br /><br />The book is divided into four main chapters- the first being- Blue Is The Colour Of Longing. This chapter showcases some beautiful art that feature many shades of blue. The author explains because blue recedes, it is perfect for infinite horizons. I especially loved Sassoferrato\u2019s The Virgin In Prayer from 1640. I don\u2019t see blue as the color of longing, but of serenity, comfort, soft beauty and peacefulness. The second chapter is Red Is The Oldest Colour. So named because of the oldest paintings on cave walls were painted in red. The author explains red is the color of blood and red always advances in art. As I studied the red paintings, I see red as big, bold and showy as in Kazimir Malevich\u2019s Red Square from 1915. One thing is certain, you cannot ignore red.<br /><br />The third chapter is Green Is The Slipperiest Of Colours. By Slipperiest the author means changing from one thing to the next. As he states green can be new life or sickly or even jealousy. There are so many shades of green that even adding a bit more yellow can change the feeling from bright and fresh to dying. I absolutely love Claude Monet\u2019s The Water-Lily Pond from 1899. His green colors speak to me of being very alive, earthy and primal. The fourth and last chapter is Gold Radiates Divinity And Luxury. The author states no other color represents wealth and power as gold does. Viewing the twelve paintings in this chapter I see gold as being big, cheerful and bright. I especially love Gustav Klimt\u2019s The Kiss from 1907. He makes me feel that love is so bright and touching with his use of gold. This tiny little book packs a big perspective for the lover of art (and I was an art major)- you will forever look at not just the subject matter in art, but at the predominant colors used and the feelings they emote. 5 STARS.", "images": [], "asin": "1781575622", "parent_asin": "1781575622", "user_id": "AENQC6O3X4BUEQWSDTBUN2VMM5VQ", "timestamp": 1541748568133, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

I felt that it was very unrealistic.  I was unable to suspend my disbelief during any portion of this story, and it soon became a chore just to finish.  The ending was well done from a thriller standpoint, but by the time we got there, none of the characters had any credibility.  I had little interest in learning how things were going to wrap up, so even a dynamic finish was unable to save this story of contrivances and bad decisions.<br /><br />Terminated was not that thrilling, and was filled with characters who consistently made bad decisions merely to move along a plot that was in the end not all that engaging.

{"rating": 5, "title": "One of the better Land Rover books", "text": "I feel this is one of the best Land Rover books I've read. Martin Hodder was the editor and owner of Land Rover Owner Magazine and is a true Land Rover enthusiast. Plus, given his position he has had ample opportunities to drive and experience a wide range of Land Rover vehicles, rub elbows with L/R engineers and insiders, and work with club members and other enthusiasts, which is immediately evident in the detail and knowledge of his writing.<br /><br />The book covers Land Rovers beginning with the background and development of the 1970 Range Rover, which is the basic platform for the Defender and Discovery and describes the Freelander. It illustrates some of the more unusual Land Rover variants like certain 6-wheel vehicles and some odd-ball military one-offs. He also dives into the corporate thinking and development stages of the Defender and Discovery vehicles, as well as the Freelander. I don't know if there is a later version, but the book I have goes up to 1998. Therefore it's limited to vintage Land Rovers up until that time.<br /><br />The book is divided into the following categories: The family of Land Rovers; A legend is born; Land Rovers at play; Let's go off-roading; Ranger Rover - The inside story of a world beater (this is a rather fascinating account by a key Land Rover engineer Geoff Miller, who led the engineering team that created the Range Rover and describes his account of how the Range Rover came to be starting in the mid-60's and other vehicles they looked at during the evaluation phases); Camel Trophy, the ultimate test (how Land Rover became the defacto vehicles used in the Camel Trophy and what it meant to them); The unbeatable Defender (why and how it came to be); The mighty V8 (the how and why Rover picked up the GM aluminum V8 in the 60's); The Dunsfold treasure (Land Rover historical vehicles collection); Land Rovers on parade; Chosing and buying a Land Rover.<br /><br />I've read a number of Land Rover enthusiast books and each seems to take a slightly different angle and fills in a different piece of the L/R history. This book is a great background-type book. What you won't find in this version is anything on the DII's, off-road driving techniques, specific how-to's for modifying your Land Rover (there are other books for that).<br /><br />In my mind, chapter 5: Range Rover - the inside story of a world-beater, (this chapter written by Geoff Miller of Land Rover engineering), is among the most revealing and interesting 25 pages of any L/R book I've ever read. It pretty much sums up that Land Rover was heavily influenced by the, then new, Ford Bronco which pioneered the widespread use of front coil springs and long, cast iron connecting arms. This seems to be something Land Rover fans think was a hat trick pulled out of thin air by Land Rover. The engineers tested the Bronco, IH Scout and some other vehicles and wisely cherry-picked the best set of features to come up with a dynamite off-roader (Range Rover). It sounds like the rear A-frame was something they did design.<br /><br />I wish there had been more information on specific changes and improvements Rover made to the GM V8 after they purchased it, that helped it be the extremely smooth and robust engine it eventually became. There are internet sights devoted to this but it would be good to see it pulled together in a book format.<br /><br />Overall, if you are into Land Rovers, I highly recommend.<br /><br />Note: James Taylor (British Journalist) also has some good books, particularly on the Discovery, if you are into the Discos. They have a lot of 'in the making' photos that are fun to look at along with detailed insider information. Ralph Hosier's How to modify Land Rover Vehicles is another good book as is Jack Jackson's Off-Road and 4 wheel Drive Book. Jack Jackson is an obvious Land Rover fan and outlines countless factors to consider in when considering long-range off-roading in developing countries. A lot of tips and techniques that are transferable for any kind of off-roading.", "images": [], "asin": "1859604374", "parent_asin": "1859604374", "user_id": "AERVDB5CM2FVGSQBTBIXZV6DKMFQ", "timestamp": 1418081008000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

It is a fascinating character study in which the author makes the best use of his ability to create worlds and situations far removed from typical experience.  Science fiction makes demands that many authors fail to appreciate; however, Mr. Banks appropriately respects the forms and tells a remarkable tale of a warrior seeking absolution.<br /><br />Mr. Banks takes interesting liberties with narrative flow--this book is not a casual read.  Instead, it makes demands and richly rewards the careful reader with the kind of perspective shift that is the hallmark of truly excellent science fiction.<br /><br />Like Dune or Lord of the Rings, Mr. Banks has constructed a believable world so complete in itself that the background becomes part of the plot.  Use of Weapons revolves around the issue of what happens when civilization and technology transcend money--what makes life worth living?  How should almost omnipotent civilizations treat less advanced peoples?  What does it mean to be human?<br /><br />The true gauge of this author's skill is that he treats the big questions without neglecting the need to tell a compelling story.

{"rating": 4, "title": "have your cake and eat it too", "text": "Reading this book is a bit like taking a really big bite of something really chewy. Taffy maybe, and not your favorite flavor, either, although definitely one you like. It's good, but you might feel like you have to work too hard.<br /><br />Shriver takes her cue from the multiple universe idea that there exists a separate reality that has sprung from each decision. There's a universe in which you did X, and a universe in which you didn't do X (or did Y). Fortunately, she doesn't try to examine this theory to its fullest, but takes a single decision made a single person, and expands her universes from there. What drives this book, then, is not \"did she or didn't she\" (she both did and didn't, in alternate chapters), but what is the result of both decisions.<br /><br />Shriver employs some very clever techniques to help her explore this theme. As the parallel chapters progress along the same time line, we see how similar the two universes are, but also how wildly different, as sometimes identical dialogue is spoken, but in vastly different contexts, or even by different characters. Shriver even gives her reader occasional anchors in time (helping to tie parallel chapters in time) by relating how the characters in each universe respond to international news events, such as the death of Princess Diana and the September 11th attacks.<br /><br />Shriver also does a great job of keeping her main character consistent through both story-lines. It's easy (easier, at least) to write a character who responds to a single set of events, than it is to write a character who must respond to two parallel sets of events and yet remain believable as a single character. Shriver absolutely gets this part right. But that is also part of what makes reading this book seem like hard work - every time you get somewhere in the narrative, you are instantly sent back to the beginning of the timeframe and must go through it all again, with the same mindset, if different details. Even the best of characters might get a little tiresome through all that. The real triumph is perhaps that we care about what happens in both realities, and can't easily say which choice was the right one.", "images": [], "asin": "0061187895", "parent_asin": "0061187895", "user_id": "AGIUG5WQNUYQCXSTO6NC5U7WTCBA", "timestamp": 1257689301000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

The author has an engaging writing style and her humor is not cliche-riddled.<br /><br />The protagonist, Jax, made me want to slap some sense into her several times along the way.  Sometimes she was funny and articulate, and other times, she was tongue-tied or outright embarrassing.<br /><br />The opening premise is that this professor of marketing at a college goes on a business trip to Arizona and takes a jeep tour of the desert.  She has a mild flirtation with the tour guide.  It never occurs to this very bright woman that this is a young, handsome guy who can be running up to four tours a day during the busy season.  When Jax is fired, she decides to sell almost everything and put the rest in storage, buy a new car, and ride back to Sedona to see Mr. Tour Guide, with whom she's built up wild fantasies in her mind.  Several months later, she gets there only to find (as if we couldn't have guessed) that he has totally forgotten her and that she was number umpteen in a whole bunch of mild flirtations.  What does she do?  She proceeds to forcibly insert herself into his life, even telling the waitress that they are engaged during their very first lunch together.<br /><br />I love the idea of starting over when your life has become boring or unsuitable, but this story just made me feel sorry for this delusional cougar-woman.<br /><br />This was obviously not the story for me, but I would read this author again.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Like its title, brilliant flashes over soggy stretches", "text": "The title comes from the \"green flash\" which Stone, stoned, glimpsed from a Mexican beach. Much of the insight here resembles the recollectons one might expect from a friend of Ken Kesey, an acquaintance of Tim Leary, and one who hung out with the scions of the counterculture in New York City, New Orleans, California north and south, London, Mexico, and Vietnam. That is, pages at a time become illuminated with wisdom-- before sinking again into a miasma of mundane names, places, and events filtered muddily or waveringly through uninspired, if competent, prose. I have only read two novels by Stone, \"A Flag for Sunrise,\" and the disappointing \"Damascus Gate.\" Like the latter book, \"Prime Green\" stumbles when it could have soared on a promising premise.<br /><br />The opening chapter rambles on about his stint in the Navy; polar-driven wind and the feel of being at the bridge gain evocative detail, but then the narrative wanders off into recollections of an Australian swimmer he fancied, a bit of action he glimpsed during the Suez crisis, and exchanging Playboys with a Soviet crew. All three anecdotes fizzle. They almost follow randomly, such is the nature of this compilation of memories. Perhaps this casual style conceals careful craft. But, from a writer of Stone's level, that is, of critical acclaim more than another hack bestselling scribe, the offhanded attitude towards such potentially valuable incidents became disappoining. They are treated so offhandedly you wonder why he troubled to bring them up. Much of this book follows suit. It reminds me of a few all-nighters, if you could tape them, with a great storyteller; the difference is, you tend to edit mentally what you were bored or confused by, and highlight the stories which enraptured you, to replay again in your memory. I'd return to this book in the same manner.<br /><br />For instance, the Bowery and its sudden replacement of white old bums with tough young blacks released from prison circa 1960 sets up a treatise on this sociological phenomenon. But, suddenly, Stone in the next paragraph sidles off into how he wrote copy for a furniture firm. Admittedly, he excels at his harrowing yet hilarious description of writing for the right-wing populist NY Daily News, which like certain media today manages to arouse the contempt of the working class for the system that supposedly favors those less qualified, yet deflects any blame from capitalism or the rich themselves for this inequality and this cynical game of having the victims turn on one another.<br /><br />His send-up of another bottom-feeding journalistic stint at what he calls the National Thunder, a sort of Weekly World News, is priceless. Anyone who could survive a paper that created headlines like \"Armless Veteran Beaten for Not Saluting Flag\" or a close runner-up, \"Skydiver Devoured By Starving Birds,\" merits some acclaim for such anecdotes. His accounts of being under the knife for a burst vessel in his brain, of interviewing bitter draftees in Vietnam, of watching the moon on the night of the first landing in 1969 from the California hills, all ring true; his narrative leaps to fitful if brief elegance in these sections. On drugs, Stone glimpses time's wheel and struggles to convey his psychedelic revelation. I wonder if any bard from this time can do so?<br /><br />The remainder of the book, once Stone leaves in search of the elusive authenticity that takes him, seemingly with little money and the kindness of many strangers become friends, to Stanford on a fellowship, to London, to Vietnam, and to Mexico in a tumultuous but-- for a while-- rather childlike time despite his wife and two children (who are barely mentioned) to support does create in this reader a sense of how much could be seen and heard and experienced by carefree Americans with not much cash, plenty of drugs, and a sense of adventure that in our day has narrowed and priced out all but the affluent or the heavily guarded! Comparing his coming of age with the later century, the combination of a strong dollar, cheap costs of living, and goodwill manage, nearly, to create a glimpse of utopia. On the other hand, his escape from menacing sailors on a Greyhound bus ride from hell that winds up with him barely getting away from the ironically if improbably named hamlet of Highspire, Pennsylvania marks a gothic tale where Poe meets Genet.<br /><br />If you want a sense of the Sixties, disjointed and disconnected, with wisdom scattered along with a lot of langour, this does re-create a tone appropriate to these times. No history, or even tightly written account, nonetheless for all its faults, I learned from it. The conclusions are the expected sadness at the decade's waste of its promise, and the government infiltration and corporate co-opting of its ideals and its innocence. Not as many knockout punches as I expected, for the book needed editing and substantial tightening. It keeps reeling about, when it should have cut the flab and trimmed up under a drill sargeant of an editor, such as he used to work for in Manhattan in the early 60s.<br /><br />The book bumps into the famous, nods, chats, and shuffles off again, In its slackness, casual air of street cred meets the dinner party, and Hollywood mingling with the Bowery, perhaps Stone, who managed to be in all of the proper places, dreadful or erotic, exotic or hilarious, remains the jester-cynic who sneers at the powers that be but knows if he had his chance on the throne (he gets a quick perch during his Hollywood visit), he'd settle down there comfortably enough. Stone, in a sloppy but occasionally memorable account, emerges rather blowsily, yet endearingly avuncular. He's slightly askew, a fitting if exasperatingly rambling witness and slyly calculating chronicler for a messy decade.", "images": [], "asin": "0060198168", "parent_asin": "0060198168", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1191356823000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 5, "title": "The Enders justify the means", "text": "Ender Wiggin is a very unusual boy -- he's a brilliant tactician, a genius, and a despised \"third\" in a future that only allows two children. He's also six years old.<br /><br />And despite the fact that Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic is about a little boy learning how to be a warrior, \"Ender's Game\" is a pretty gripping and sometimes grim adventure story. The descriptions of children being taught out how to be cold-blooded warriors is pretty creepy, but the well-developed future world that Card comes up with is pretty awesome.<br /><br />After a fight with a gang of bullies, Ender Wiggin is approached by an army officer who wants him to join the elite Battleschool, where kid geniuses become soldiers -- basically because aliens are about to attack Earth AGAIN and may end up wiping out the human race. His brother Peter is too wild and cruel, and his beloved sister Valentine is too mild-mannered.<br /><br />Ender accepts, and quickly finds himself in a dog-eat-dog space school where he soon becomes loathed for the special treatment the teachers occasionally give him -- when they aren't observing his every move. And it soon becomes obvious that Ender has a natural ability that exceeds that of most of the Battleschool recruits: he instinctively knows how to outmaneuver his opponents and protect himself in a fight, even if he annoys some of the \"army\" commanders who don't like being outshone.<br /><br />Back on Earth, his brother and sister try to alter the increasingly unstable politics of Earth by subtle manipulation of the public, a situation that may bring the ruthless Peter into greater power. And as Ender reaches the end of his training, he faces both the buggers and the knowledge of what he is capable of.<br /><br />\"Ender's Game\" is kind of an unusual space opera, because the actual war between humans and buggers is not front-and-center until the last act of the story. Up until then, it's about following Ender and his equally unusual siblings as they develop prematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason). Ender's time at Battle School and Command School feel rather slow at times, only for things to blossom in the final laps of the novel -- Card suddenly turns all our feelings and expectations on their heads. The tragedy of children turned into soldiers becomes even more tragic as we discover what the war is actually all about.<br /><br />As you'd expect from Fascist Hogwarts In Space, there are a lot of kids at Battle School who are developed to certain degrees. But the center of the story is Ender himself -- and despite being a tactical genius with loads of natural ability, Ender never seems like a Wesley Crusher. Like a boy destined to be a Spartan warrior, his inborn skills are what will keep him from ever finding peace. His childhood is sacrificed for war.<br /><br />The other part of the story rests on Peter and Valentine -- Valentine is too nice, while Peter is gradually revealed to be a ruthless genius who works anything and anyone for his goals, which may or may not be self-serving. It's oddly fun to see the growing influence of \"Demosthenes\" and \"Locke\" on the cruel government.<br /><br />\"Ender's Game\" is an intelligent, gripping space opera with an undercurrent of intense tragedy -- it's kind of slow at times, but the strong writing and intriguing main trio keep it afloat.", "images": [], "asin": "B001NOD0Q8", "parent_asin": "B001NOD0Q8", "user_id": "AHVIMKECEZDXXK5QIGX7KWJPN6DQ", "timestamp": 1368235385000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 4, "title": "A Detailed Account of How Amazon Functions and Where Amazon Is Headed in the Future!", "text": "While this book seems written for anyone with an entrepreneurial soul, it will also be intriguing to read if you are a customer and want to know more about what amazon may be offering in the future. You will learn about the five interlocking flywheels that other authors mention, but this author fully understands.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />What percentage of online customers read reviews before making a purchasing decision?<br />How was the Kindle created?<br />How has amazon become a self-published author's dream publisher and distributor?<br />How much more do Prime members spend?<br />What are the fifteen major innovations amazon built or scaled?<br />Why is amazon launching so many satellites?<br />What are the Amazon Leadership Principles?<br />How many private label products does amazon sell?<br /><br />This book seems 90 percent positive, 9 percent negative and 1 percent cautious. The author highlights many aspects of amazon that are intriguing. I'd say the author is probably more of an optimist than a pessimist although many of his sources of information are negative so that flavors the book here and there.<br /><br />What you will find interesting is all the information on brands and what is happening to them. A few chapters get into really technical details and dollar amounts that would make an accountant's heart beat faster but nearer the end of the book your eyes may start to glaze over. lol<br /><br />The sections on warehouses made me respect the hard work of the employees and feel grateful to them. However automated warehouses sound like a good idea in the long run.<br /><br />My criticism of this book is that the author didn't seem to make the effort to interview many happy amazon employees besides to mention that smart people enjoy working with other brilliant employees.<br />Which must be bliss as they are part of making the future come true.<br /><br />I also did not agree with the author about how he views amazon if it was a person. Amazon to me is more like a trusted friend who helps me find all the things I learn to love and need. The other day I desperately needed supplies for my sick cat and amazon sent them to me ahead of the regular schedule. That to me was the kindest thing they have done for me and I really appreciated it.<br /><br />So read this book with a pinch of salt because the author's ideas are not altogether mainstream. He is a good researcher and has an amazing handle on all the information but I think even he does not see the big picture the way I have come to view it over the years. You can't stop the future from happening the way it is supposed to.

{"rating": 3, "title": "For avant-gardist gardening snobs", "text": "Thomas Hobbs is, at least in the persona he presents in this book, an avant-gardist gardening snob.  He sees gardening as a fashion-driven art, where trendy plants are to be discarded as soon as they become too popular with the petit bourgeoisie, for whom his contempt is made clear on almost every page of text. Some of this stuff can't be spoofed, because it's impossible to be more catty than Hobbs here (block quotes preceded by ** and italics presented as ALL CAPS):<br /><br />** Some gardeners will never learn the art of plant assemblage... As I drive by their predictable efforts, I often wonder, \"Is Life Easier?\"<br /><br />** Being a left-handed, Gemini breach-birth ALLOWS me to love tetraploid daylilies. It is WHO I AM BOTANICALLY.<br /><br />** Bowling balls are appropriate in Marcia Donahue's garden/gallery in Berkeley, California, because SHE DID IT FIRST.<br /><br />Hobbs is obsessed with rejection of the common and the cliched, but most of his featured gardens also look alike, in part because they're almost all small shaded urban gardens in the coastal Northwest, but more notably because they eschew flowers in favor of foliage plants - mostly bright or spiky - with color from kitschy cast-offs and outr\u00e9 sculpture, including flesh-colored ceramic penises.<br /><br />In my (hardly original) opinion, a big problem with most people's enjoyment of the arts today is that the field has already done what is pretty or handsome, and since its current practitioners are jaded by their predecessors' work and aspire to being original, they must often produce what most nonspecialists consider ugly. This is notably a problem with architecture and oil painting (and classical music) by about World War I, and haute couture since the Kennedy Administration. So far horticulture has largely escaped the curse of avant-gardist ugliness, but not in this book. I wondered whether it was fair to Hobbs to say he has passed a step beyond \"Shocking Beauty\" to where much of this book is ugly, but then I came to his penultimate page of prose:<br /><br />** I have noticed a switch in gardening, from \"pretty\" to what I call \"the New Ugly.\" I find this fascinating and very, very attractive. In gardening, UGLY HAS BEEN REDEFINED by brilliant plantsmen and -women who get absolutely no thrill from trying to make a pretty picture. By increasing the dosage of all that is weird and unexpected, these thrillseekers are creating powerful, unforgettable experiences.<br /><br />Umh, NO IT HASN'T! If we wanted \"powerful, unforgettable experiences\" of ugliness, we would just move into a junkyard next to an oil refinery! That said, if the book's title or dust-jacket reflected this decadent philosophy, I could rate it 4 stars [...]<br /><br />Perhaps oddly, Hobbs' Vancouver garden is larger, far more colorful and floriferous, and far more beautiful, than the preceding gardens. Hobbs doesn't fail to add a campy dramatic element, however, to his discovery of the Vancouver house:<br /><br />** I will never forget ringing the doorbell, expecting \"Max,\" [from Sunset Boulevard] or at least Harvey Korman dressed as \"Max,\" to open the door. Instead, a very short Alfred Hitchcock type greeted us, with a badly-wigged woman peering over his shoulder.<br /><br />As you might have guessed, the text of this book is more about Hobbs' persona than about gardening. But it isn't until the very last page of prose that we learn exactly how, for Hobbs, the garden is therapy - about talking to plants, which most people can't do (\"and it shows\"!) - and about remembering gardeners who gave him plants and then died of AIDS. Life is a veil of tears, so maybe we should cut him some slack, even if we are not in love with ugliness.", "images": [], "asin": "0881926469", "parent_asin": "0881926469", "user_id": "AHFSWVRFTJGNDGJ6CAHPRL3XUW4Q", "timestamp": 1137287852000, "helpful_vote": 52, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

His companies are stronger than ever. What should Apple do? &#34;What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.&#34; Now Michael Dell is fighting to keep his own fledgling alive and Steve's baby is the one running the world.<br /><br />We have watched from the sidelines as book after book has come out and everyone is painting a small section of a larger portrait.<br />If you've read any of the previous biographies, and I'm sure you have, you know there is so much to write and one person is so much more complex than any writer could ever portray them as. It really is amazing how everyone is so different.<br /><br />This book appears to show Steve as a human and a person who realizes he has faults. &#34;How can this be me?&#34; we've all asked ourselves, including Steve Jobs. What sets him apart from others is the ability to learn from mistakes. Other biographies, such as Walter Isaacson's, doesn't really portray him as a changing individual but more as a person who finally got the upperhand over his 'enemies'. I really don't think that's the main component of Jobs.<br /><br />His getting the upperhand wasn't to put others in their place, as Isaacson writes, but to deliver perfection. People standing in the way of the product, seen or unseen, would have to be removed. Crass? Sure, but not for the sake of being an ass but for the product and thinking different. Now in Steve's Job's world perfection is never perfect. It can always be improved and should be improved. Apple 3.5 has yet to prove it can deliver without the prior successes of the Steve Job's era. We'll find out.<br /><br />It's good to see Becoming Steve Job's showing another side to Steve. Steve really was a team player because all players have weaknesses. When you see he can hire someone on the spot because he saw the Dock, it shows it's about the product not that he had the ideas.<br /><br />Not all businesses will work or should run like Apple or Pixar.

This is the reason Steve Jobs was able to sell NeXT to Apple because WebObjects were already be profitable and licensed to other companies.

It's done in a way that's similar to learning about a new friend's background, a little bit at at time.  We learn more of the secrets of the castle, yet the mystery deepens.

I will confess what prompted me to get it is the waffles on the cover (which have a purpose, our main character's favorite word is waffle). This book was refreshing because in a world where everyone seems to be out for themselves lately, Somebody/Nobody emails Jessie out of the blue to help her navigate her way through her massive life change of moving from Chicago to Los Angeles because her father married someone he met on the internet without really telling Jessie anything about it.<br /><br />I completely empathize with having your world turned upside down since I changed high schools (and states) my senior year of high school. It was horribly awkward the first day of class and there are those nasty girls everywhere you go who seem to dislike you just because you're you. I thought the author captured this experience perfectly. I kind of wish I had a SN to get me through those first few months.<br /><br />I think all the characters in this book are well written and the plot is well developed (although honestly I think it took a tad too long to get to the end for the big reveal). I thoroughly enjoyed the author's writing style and I loved the random &quot;tell me three things&quot; segments of SN and Jessie's conversation. I looked forward to every exchange between Jessie and SN. Those were my favorite parts.<br /><br />My one teeny negative comment about this book is that the inside cover states it is for ages 12 and up. While I realize sex, underage drinking and profanity are sadly becoming norms in our society, I do not think this book is suited for 12 year olds. There is a lot of emotional upheaval as well as what is mentioned above and I think it would be too complex for someone who has not experienced the trials and tribulations of high school yet.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Horribly Written", "text": "This story line might have been a great one, and in fact, that's why I checked this book out of our library to begin with. But right off the bat I noticed sentence fragments within the first paragraph. I was hopeful that this might just be part of the author's style. On the second page, the author wrote \"he\" instead of \"she,\" where the character was clearly female: \"My cousin, Lil married when he was only 16, and is mistress of Edington and has a small child.\"<br /><br />The dialogue is choppy and the use of dialect is creative at best, but most likely completely overdone: \"I saw cha befer yur father, and for 17 years, I have been cha watcher. I do no want cha to be hurt...\" and the more that I read, the worse the spelling and grammar errors. By the end of chapter two I was completely focused on the abundance of errors and had forgotten already what was going on in the story.<br />From chapter two: \"...If ya don't come round from time to time, I jest might tell im, bout our little poking, and e may kill usuns both.

{"rating": 3, "title": "An Interesting Start", "text": "I don\u2019t often read crime thrillers, but I\u2019m aware of many of the tropes. And Cain pulls a lot of the standard ones out of the box for this story. However, while I found the serial killer plot line rather weak, I also got the feeling that Cain was simply using it to gradually build up the story of Gretchen and Archie, which is by far the most interesting aspect of the book. Gretchen is a sufficiently creepy and perceptive psychopath, made even creepier by the fact that she is a very pretty woman who seems more suited to beauty pageants than ruthlessly torturing and murdering people.<br /><br />Basically, Cain takes a different approach to a well-worn story: instead of a crack detective furiously hunting down his arch-serial-killer-nemesis, you have the repercussions of the end of that hunt \u2014 a broken detective, a world still filled with other evils, and a crazy killer who seems to have the ability to keep pulling stings even after she\u2019s been caught. She frames the classic cop-killer relationship from an interesting and fresh (and creepy) perspective.<br /><br />Despite the overall weakness of the crazy teacher plot, I get where Cain is coming from, and I appreciate her attempt to try something different. I think she just needs to work on the depth of the \u201ckiller of the week\u201d plots while building up the beautifully frightening interactions between Gretchen and Archie. In other words, she needs to concentrate on making sure all her plots and sub-plots are the same quality. With Heartsick, I found myself quickly skimming through some of the crazy teacher guy chapters so I could back to the Archie-Gretchen parts \u2014 one plot was noticeably stronger than the other. Balance, Cain. Balance.<br /><br />Other than that, I found the story pretty enjoyable. The characters are well-characterized. Her settings are adequately described.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Made me reflect on my own high school experience", "text": "I really enjoyed Pledged by Alexandra Robbins, so I was looking forward to reading this book.  While I liked Pledged a bit more this one (just felt it was put together a little better), I thought Geeks was still a valuable read both for anyone currently in the education system or anyone who doesn't remember their high school experiences fondly.<br /><br />Plenty of people have already discussed a summary of the book, so I won't repeat that here. Robbins does a great job of bringing the characters to life - I felt like I really knew them and the different struggles they were facing. I must admit that I enjoyed reading the characters' personal accounts better than the research and analysis portions of the book.  For me, the best parts of the book were after Robbins assigned each character a different challenge. I really enjoyed seeing how they reacted to their challenge, the things each one did to meet the challenge, and the results or changes in their life that sometimes followed.  It really made me wonder what would have happened in my high school days if, instead of accepting things the way they were and telling myself nothing could change, I had tried to make it change by doing things similar to what the characters in this book did (sorry for the vagueness - I'm trying to not give anything away so I don't ruin the experience for someone who hasn't read the book yet). This is also the part that I feel may be most valuable to a students who is struggling - having them read these examples of other students who struggled and the changes that some were able to make through their own actions.<br /><br />If I had one criticism of the book, it's that it doesn't touch on any research or ideas about kids who were popular in high school and who are now wildly successful.  The book can manage to give the impression that it's only the outliers who end up as successes, but this hasn't been always been true in real life (and I'm not just talking about people who, like the popular girl in this book, were part of the \"in-crowd\" but also could fit in with outliers).

They seek to travel into each other's souls to heal wounds and set captives free.  Traveling into souls is not without danger.  Death may even occur.  However, these people take the risk to pursue freedom from the sin that so easily entangles.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the truth presented in the story line.  God still speaks to us.  Miracles do happen.  We all have hidden sin or soul crushing wounds that need God's redemption.  We also need each other to stand in the gap for us and to help us when we ourselves are too weak to stand.  What is not true is this idea of jumping into another person's soul.  The writer even admits this truth in the author's note at the end of the book.  He takes artistic license to progress the story.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fantastic account of life in a leper colony", "text": "Molokai is a wonderful example of how to write a great historical fiction novel.  The author has taken a very difficult subject matter, leprosy, and given the reader a wonderful insight into the human aspects of being a leper.<br /><br />The story takes place in a leper colony founded by Father Damien.  Kalaupapa, a town on Molokai, is a sterile and inhospitable place when Father Damien started the colony so that he could minister to the lepers.  This story does not occur during that difficult time.  Instead, we see the life of a leper through the eyes of a Hawaiian girl as she grows from a seven year old into a 50 something adult.  We see the lows, highs, and in-between times.<br /><br />I found this novel to be a sad story but very enlightening and positive.  The writing almost makes you feel like you are in Kalaupapa.  The story really shines when Rachel finally gets paroled and is free to leave the colony.  What she does once leaving is truly heartfelt.<br /><br />I was raised in Hawaii during the 50's and 60's and was well aware of Kalaupapa.  This book reminded me of the time I grew up on Oahu.  I remember many of the things done by Rachel.  I even sailed on the Lurline from Hawaii to California just like Rachel.  I loved this book and it is a great book to read.

{"rating": 5, "title": "A mind-twisting foray into the caverns of haunted memories", "text": "Is it possible for the author of In Silent Graves, one of my favorite books, to write something even better?  Yes, and 'Keepers' proves it.  Gary Braunbeck has an extraordinary talent for taking you into parts of the mind that ebb and flow with surreal horror and unbearable charm, twisting emotion into intricately woven braids of thought, imagination, and lurid reality.<br /><br />'Keepers' is so much more than the blurb on the back cover, it has a haunting 'coming of age' tale so poignantly detailed that I forgot I was reading a horror book.  But nothing makes charm more vivid than the red-rimmed eyes of an unseen menace creeping up behind you.<br /><br />Gil Stewart is an ordinary man, running his own business of 'novelties and collectibles' stores, and caring for his institutionalized Down's Syndrome nephew, Carson, one week a month.  Until one day his normal life is shattered, first by witnessing a bizarre death on the highway, then by a mangy dog crawling under his house to die, and lastly a phone call from the institution telling him Carson is missing.<br /><br />It's time to Gil to remember his past, to piece together the fragments of his memories in order to discover the secret of the Keepers, and why the Magritte-Man killed on the highway warned him of them.  Gil must remember his parents, and the unbreakable bond he formed with Beth, his girl of the past, long missing and presumed dead.  He must remember his kindnesses, to animals and elderly and all those who are invisible to the rest of the world.  Before the Keepers come.<br /><br />Anyone who has read Braunbeck will not be surprised by the talent in his writing, but if this is your first Braunbeck book, then get ready for an emotional roller coaster that will leave you gasping for air and unable to put the book down until you are finished.

While the book is fast paced, intriguing, and creative, I think my expectations would\u2019ve been too high if I had read it during the peak of its hype last year.<br /><br />I really loved the dual narrative of the book  and it played well with the storytelling. Every chapter/section ends in such a way that it makes it difficult to stop turning pages. The setting is great and felt like a Get Out and Riverdale combo. The social commentary is undeniable.<br /><br />The mystery itself was a bit lack luster. There are a couple good twists, but it was more a matter of seeing how things unfold than figuring out whodunnit. I really liked the main characters, but felt like Devon\u2019s was so much more fleshed out and interesting than Chiamaka\u2019s. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of how much time was spent on their love lives. It didn\u2019t fit in well with the main plot.

Probably from a comic book ad. My circle of friends did the same and we traded stamps and looked for places as far away as the imagination can travel. I religiously returned the Jamestown Stamp companies 'on consignment' mail that I didn't choose - kids love mail, they may or not completely understand the implications. My cousin didn't. He had a stellar collection. We thought he was rich. I mean he was loaded with stamps and needed the really big GALACTIC (or something) stamp collection mounting book that I could only wish I could afford with bottle return change. My younger cousin apparently failed to notice the fine print \"SEND CASH. RETURN STAMPS YOU DON'T BUY CAUSE WE'RE GONNA SUE YOU FOR THEIV'IN IF YOU DON'T\". This minor detail was beyond my younger cousin's comprehension, so he kept everything Jamestown sent him ... and they sent him a lot until one day ma gets a call that she owes like a billion $ for her son's delinquency. We were consigned to a significant increase in supervision until we were all band.<br /><br />I learned more history and geography from those years than the rest of my life. Bosnia-Herzegovina? I could spell it and knew it on the map. That lesson in philately fueled my future life to in fact visit and seek to visit those lost countries.<br /><br />The book has two kinds of lost countries. Some had affordable and plentiful over-stamped origins from WW1 & 2. I had those. Some here are serious money stamp collecting from historical and Realpolitik moments that were new to me with stamps absolutely out of price range.<br /><br />The British Guiana 1c Magenta (More Than $10M), Baden 9 Kreuzer (Approximately $1.1M) we knew those ... we were constantly on alert for them.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a fast read and not very detailed.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Decent for beginners but some incorrect info, and author's own sites are lacking", "text": "I am a web designer who has done work for Fortune 1000, non-profs, and govt, but I have little experience with small e-commerce sites, so I thought this book might be helpful.<br /><br />This book is written at a *very* basic level, a small step up from explaining what a website or search engine is. Much of it is common sense, but there are some pretty good points that not everyone will know. So on that level, I think its good for beginners who have no experience with web development or even how to run a business.<br /><br />What concerned me was that because the author is not actually in the field of web development, he seems to just \"improvise\" some info. This book contains some incorrect information and there are some issues with the author's own websites.<br />-The author's websites should be models of well designed e-commerce sites. They are \"fine\" and functional, but there are some design and usability issues. forcopywritersonly.com does not look professionally designed, has some basic usability issues such as lack of breadcrumbs, nav states not staying on at the tertiary level, an inconsistent use of text links and button links, blog missing most common blog functionality, use of the word \"click here\" which is seen as a big faux pas in the industry, etc. I just showed my girlfriend forgraphicdesignersonly.com (his second site), and told her the guy on the homepage says he is a graphic designer. Her response was, \"Are you f-ing kidding me?\" It doesnt look professional at all despite the author saying he is a \"Registered Graphic Designer\" (NEVER heard of such a thing).<br />-He defines terms he says are common in the industry that just arent. \"Beta site\" is a not a demo site used by designers, it is a site used for web applications before they are done. I have never heard a designer use that term. We might call them staging sites or testing sites. We don't use the term \"masthead\". The author must be thinking of magazines. We call them headers or banners. On page 105, he says, \"This is tricky because most internet web browsers, like Foxfire..\" The author must be thinking of Firefox. Typo perhaps, but at the level this book is written, one assumes the readers havent heard of these different web browsers.<br />-He mentions applications or services that are not common or forgets some common ones. For example, he says Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression are \"used by most professional designers\". Dreamweaver, yes. The second I have never seen used ever (and I have worked lots of places). When he mentions email marketing software, he forgets the number one most popular, MagnetMail (and yes, it was big at time of publication too).<br />-When talking about web development, he only talks about web design, the word information architecture never appears and that is a big part of it too.<br />-His lists of websites to consult or applications to use that exist throughout the book are deceptively long. Usually the first couple are commonly used and the next 12 or seem to be just the result of the author doing a web search and entering the results into his book w/o actually knowing anything about them.<br /><br />Anyway, again, I wouldnt completely discount this book because it has some pointers on promoting your business and such, but there have to be other books out there written by professionals in the industry (people who work at reputable web development or PR firms) who really know what they are talking about.", "images": [], "asin": "1592578896", "parent_asin": "1592578896", "user_id": "AEJS6MM4HBJ4ZYHVZML6KTSDB46Q", "timestamp": 1304203420000, "helpful_vote": 82, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fantastic series starter for fans of fantasy - YA OR adult!", "text": "This book was my first ever Schwab read, and I went into it a little bit apprehensive, because she is so widely loved that I wondered if this series would live up to the expectations I had for it. I picked it up for the Life & Lit June group read, and ended up putting it off until the last possible minute because I was so wary, but my nervousness was entirely unfounded. This book was phenomenal!<br /><br />KELL \u27b3\u27b3<br />What can I even say? Kell is one of the most lovable male MCs I\u2019ve seen in a really long time. He\u2019s so loving and protective, despite his ongoing self-identity crises regarding his family. He loves his brother Rhy with a fierceness that I couldn\u2019t get enough of, and he\u2019s just so genuinely good in his heart that I couldn\u2019t help but root for him. He\u2019s one of those MCs that makes me afraid to continue the series because I can\u2019t handle anything terrible happening to him.<br /><br />LILA \u27b3\u27b3<br />I didn\u2019t really know what to make of Lila at first, because to be frank, her excuses for thievery kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Like\u2026 you\u2019re just going to steal from all of these people because you can? I wouldn\u2019t have minded so much if she just stole food or whatever, but trinkets? (I revisited this annoyance a few times later in the book, too.) Overall, though, I really enjoyed her sassy attitude and the way she refused to let anyone tell her what to do or hold her down. I loved that she insisted on going on an adventure, even if it meant risking her life, and her interactions with Kell were just adorable.<br /><br />RHY \u27b3\u27b3<br />Adorable. Absolutely adorable. He actually made me cry a few times because he just is so pure and innocent and golden.<br /><br />HOLLAND \u27b3\u27b3<br />Holland honestly gave me the sketchiest vibes ever from the beginning, but I think he\u2019s a fantastic character and I pitied him more often than not. I know some stuff went down, but I really hope we get to learn more about him later in the series.<br /><br />PLOT & WORLD \u27b3\u27b3<br />I thought the plot, as well as the world-building, were absolutely incredible. I loved the idea of these parallel cities that the Antari could travel between, and I thought the magic system was beautifully built up. Too many books ignore the foundation for their magic systems and you\u2019re kind of left just going, \u201coh, well, it\u2019s magic and that\u2019s that,\u201d but Schwab didn\u2019t do that at all in this book. The idea of these Antari being sort of the chosen ones who could control blood was just really cool, and I really hope that Kell and Holland aren\u2019t actually the only ones left.<br /><br />WRITING \u27b3\u27b3<br />Like I said, this was my first time ever reading anything by Victoria Schwab, so I had no idea what to expect. My very first impression from the opening segment,<br /><br />&#34;Kell wore a very peculiar coat.<br />It had neither one side, which would be conventional, nor two, which would be unexpected, but several, which was, of course, impossible.&#34;<br /><br />was that her writing reminded me a great deal of Tolkien, circa The Hobbit. As I got further into the book, I did find that Victoria\u2019s voice is very much her own, but I enjoyed it to no end. It was the perfect balance of straightforward and flowery prose, and it painted a splendid picture while never wasting too much time on the details.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT \u27b3\u27b3<br />Overall, I thought this book was a fantastic beginning to a series and I cannot wait to continue with book #2. I gave this an easy 5/5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who likes three-dimensional high fantasy read, full of a delightful set of characters and a terrifically intriguing world.", "images": [], "asin": "0765399113", "parent_asin": "0765399113", "user_id": "AGUBMV3R2DG7GLZYVWKZMZPGRUSA", "timestamp": 1510068690744, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

Dostoyevsky argues that it is more important for man to have personality and be seen as an individual, and that he will even choose to suffer rather than be seen as just a part of the collective.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a story illustrating his philosophy, using as his protagonist a poor, unremarkable, and rather unlikeable man desperate to stand out, to be seen.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED: I liked the overall message of the book. I generally don\u2019t enjoy reading philosophy, but I did agree with his conclusions.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN\u2019T LIKE: I generally don\u2019t enjoy reading philosophy.

But I took a chance and because all my other choices on Vine were exhausted.<br /><br />I really tried to like this book but I could already tell it was going to be trouble from the first chapter.  The book's first person narrative left too many 'like's in sentences that whenever I passed over the word (even if it was used in a proper way), it really made me stop and grit my teeth.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem was that I could never get immersed in it.  I never believed any of the characters or liked any of them.  They all talk exactly the same way trying to be witty, and the book features a wide array of characters (18 year old boys and girls, 20-something gay guys, old gay guy, fathers, mothers).  It just made it very hard to distinguish anything.<br /><br />I do commend certain vignettes the author had taken, deciding to talk about homosexuality in good ways, tackle sex and abortion issues, the fact that college might not be for everyone, and that reality doesn't necessarily have all the magical moments in movies (even though this book certainly picks and chooses which ones it wants to have).  These issues were still done I think relatively immaturely and it tries a bit too much to be Sex and the City but the tween version.<br /><br />All in all, not for me.  I think it definitely had potential but it really sticks within the chick lit genre without much life elsewhere.

{"rating": 4, "title": "super cute", "text": "i read this book in one sitting - i really enjoyed it. i went into it no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. warning, a bit spoilery!<br /><br />i agree with another reviewer that the summary gives away too much - i'm glad i read it when i requested the book and promptly forgot the details except for sports romance with a breakup and previous one night stand. because if i'd read the summary again right before i read the book, i would have been annoyed and bored, knowing what was coming. as it was, i was shocked when appropriate.<br /><br />it was funny and sexy, though a little bit oddly paced. the Chris thing stretches out a bit longer than I'd like at the beginning, I really couldn't wrap my head around why Marlee was with him when he treated her so bad. Then that blows up and Gavin comes along. I expected more of a chase or the 'wait I'm not ready for a relationship', even though a bit of time passes it does seem a bit soon after getting out of a long term relationship. yes, i realise this is a problem later on and why she does what she does, i guess i thought it was odd that's all. Also, the end with chris was unnecessary and unrealistic.<br /><br />Continuing on with the pacing thing, it didn't flow as well as I would have liked. weeks/months go by in a sentence and I'm like, wait, slow down. I think we missed some of the fun falling in love stuff, which sucked. There were a lot of conflicts, possibly too many. The mean girls got a bit old. I think Madison could have been enough, though the whole Courtney thing was funny at the beginning, but the sister too and the southern girl that is nice in the beginning... It was just a lot. I don't know.<br /><br />I loved Brynn and Naomi of course. They were fantastic side characters. The hashtags got old super fast. I thought it was funny at first but then just became grating. Especially at really dramatic points - 'he made this huge decision without telling me' #personalfoul. like wtf? i tried to ignore them but they just stood out. They might have been less annoying if there weren't so many, or weren't used when they shouldn't have been.<br /><br />Gavin was fantastic and amazing. The thing he does at the end seemed a little out of character if I'm being honest, not consistent with what we'd seen so far. That was a bit of a bummer. Other than that, I adored him.<br /><br />Marlee was a fabulous character as well. They were both really realistic and well developed. Now all this complaining and it sounds like I hated it - not at all! I really debated on giving it 5 stars but the things I mentioned above are what knocked it to a 4 star for me. But it had a lot going for it. As I mentioned, I loved all the characters. The writing was overall very good. I laughed several times and it was adorable with the right dash of sexy.

Can't wait for the next tome to come out this autumn 2010.  Let me add this however:  Some of the slang expressions spoken by one of the protagonists is stated over and over.  If some readers object, I ask you to reconsider.  I say this because it is MORE in line with REAL-LIFE.  People will become enamoured with particular phrases or words and they stick with them for life, despite that those expressions are oft hackneyed, as a result.  REAL people talk like that.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fantasy+permaculture+sci-fi+romance+excellent writing+addictive plot+dystopia=1 perfect book!", "text": "I give this book 10 out of 10 acorns! I seriously LOVE so much about this book! Let me count the ways...<br /><br />(1) The characters are realistic: They are all complex and they don't fit into molds. Sometimes I wanted them to be perfect (you know how you sometimes scream at characters \"No, don't do that! Can't you tell that's a really stupid decision?!?!\"), but the decisions these characters make fit with their histories and personalities and experiences. They don't do something just to make the book work out (you know how sometimes in a book, a character will do something totally out-of-character, just to further the plot? That doesn't happen in this book). The \"villains\" are also very well fleshed out and very realistic--you really get a feel for how and why they \"tick.\"<br /><br />(2) The world is well-thought out: I'm a big fantasy and science fiction reader. I love both genres, and this book has them both! Inside the biodome is very much like a medieval fantasy--indeed, they're Live Action Role Players that have been role playing for 20 years, and raised their kids to know no other reality! Outside of the biodome is the science-fiction. Writing sci-fi, especially sci-fi that takes place in the near-future, is really hard. Who hasn't read a scifi book written in the 70s and found the characters using big floppy disks or other outdated technology...or seen everyone flying in outerspace in the year 2000...when obviously we aren't doing that. Yet, Jesikah's world feels very real, sometimes disturbingly so in a dystopian way.<br /><br />(3) There's permaculture! To make the biodome sustainable without any outside interventions or inputs, the people inside the biodome use permaculture. I really loved the thought exercise of how permaculture works in that kind of system. There's also some thought-provoking commentary about environmentalism. This book really got my imagination, as well as my philosophical brain, working!<br /><br />(4) I very much love that there doesn't seem to be any occurrences, people, or things that occur SIMPLY to further the plot. Those kind of things drive me NUTS in a book. There's also no inconsistencies, that I can recall from my multople re-readings. I've read many a book series where, halfway through the series, the author seemingly forgets how old a character is, what their background is or what color their hair is, or how they're related to someone, or how a bit of technology works. The facts change, and your stuck there wondering which one is the right one.<br /><br />(5) The book--and series--is quite the page turner. I will admit to  having totally abandoned all my permies moderator responsibilities when I got my books...and having deprived my self of sleep to read \"one more chapter.\" (We all know how that goes, right? :D)<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this book and this series. It's like the author reached in my brain, saw my love of sci-fi, fantasy, permaculture, dystopian fiction, romance, realistic characters, and consistent writing and addictive plots, and took all those things and put them into a book. I'm pretty sure she somehow channeled me into Willow, because I could totally see myself doing and feeling as she did.<br /><br />On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being, \"you can pry this book from my cold, dead fingers,\" this book gets a 10!

{"rating": 2, "title": "Lost and Never Found", "text": "The Dragon Round by Stephen S. Power is a book with a beautiful cover that unfortunately never delivers. The writing and plot meandered so much and ended up tripping over itself. We had one series of confrontations after another with a revenge-stricken Captain in Jeryon that had the strategic foresight of a newborn baby.<br /><br />The Dragon Round is the story of Jeryon, a Captain whose crew abandons him alone in the middle of nowhere to die, committing mutiny. The only thing that drives him is revenge. When he, and the healer that was given a \u2018Captain\u2019s Chance\u2019 somehow manage to stumble upon a nest of dragon\u2019s eggs, he knows he finally has his vehicle for revenge against all those that wronged him.<br /><br />I had a difficult time finishing this story. I almost gave up several times, in fact, it took me around 2 weeks just to finish this book. I hated the writing style. I hated how Jeryon was pretty much an evil guy that was portrayed as a victim. What he did, the people he attacked, those were not the actions of an innocent man wronged. When I first read this I was thinking I would get something akin to The Count of Monte Cristo. Unfortunately, this book cannot even tie the shoes of that masterpiece. For this book to improve, the story needs to flow better. It jumped around so much and the writing style was a confusing mix of changing perspectives and tenses. Furthermore, the way that Jeryon treats the dragon is downright dreadful, and no way to inspire loyalty. I would not recommend this book and hope that prior to releasing some of the flow and character issues can be cleaned up. I am giving this book 2/5 flames for an almost frozen-solid plot with flat characters that never really have a chance to develop.<br /><br />I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "1501133209", "parent_asin": "1501133209", "user_id": "AG5IJUHNFPIJTPTLALKCL465NHRQ", "timestamp": 1471484339000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

This series has been firmly relegated to library status for me which makes it a little more tolerable since I am only wasting time and not time and money. My complaints have been echoed a million times over by other reviews. There are sloppy continuity errors, the series seems stuck in 80s or 90s, the writing is stilted, the recipes take over the entire book, Hannah's technological skills are on par with an 90 year old instead of a 30 year old, there is no character development and of course, the horrible, no good love triangle. These books are tired. I'll give you that the mystery was better this time, with the last book's loose ends being tied up (who killed the bus driver), albeit quite sloppily and in a way that felt forced, but the never ending love triangle is absurd at this point. It's been two years since Norman proposed and there has been no change.<br /><br />I am a late 20s professional in a conservative profession, and I detest pantyhose and I only wear them when I absolutely have to, which would be precisely NEVER to a social event in the middle of a blistering heat wave! Please show me a 30-something other than Hannah Swensen who would ever wear pantyhose to a social event in the middle of summer. Does Ms. Fluke know any women Hannah's age living in 2013? Because it sure doesn't seem like it. The cell phone, the lack of call waiting or caller id, the pantsuit... There are just too many inconsistencies that don't add up. And yet - I could possibly overlook all of these if Hannah would just marry Norman and be done with it.

{"rating": 5, "title": "A Favorite of the year", "text": "I very rarely give novella collections a five-star rating, but this one impressed me so much that I just had to do it. Each story has a unique spin on it that I just loved.<br /><br />In The Plucky Miss Ruth by Laura Rollins, the leads have met each other before, but only recently did they have the opportunity to go beyond simple pleasantries to something more meaningful. Ruth\u2019s \u201ctime loop\u201d is intriguing as is her penchant for articles on scientific discovery. The inclusion of this concept takes the story from pleasant to utterly entertaining. Her matchmaking is entertaining as well, and, of course, her own happily ever after is not far away. There hasn't been a Rollins' book I haven't liked, so I knew that I was in good hands with the opening story.<br /><br />Mr. Dowling\u2019s Remedy by Annette Lyon has one of the most interesting \u2013 and unlikely \u2013 setting of a romance that I\u2019ve read. Beverly Stanton is sent to an asylum by her conniving stepfather, where she meets Dr. Crandall Dowling. And no, he\u2019s not a doctor for the asylum, but rather a patient who suffers from what I believe would be called Tourette\u2019s syndrome today. I wasn\u2019t sure how the author would pull this off, but she does so in a compassionate, dignified way. Their romance ends up being so sweet and tender, and everything resolves in quite an exciting and unexpected way.<br /><br />A Railway through the Roses by Lisa L. Catmull is by a new-to-me author, but I loved it. It can be classified by one word \u2013 chemistry! There is such a wonderful chemistry between the two main characters. I simultaneously enjoyed it and also wanted to bonk their heads together because their solution was so obvious. However, matters of the heart were not discussed openly like matters of business. Due to being orphaned, Lady Ann is the owner of her own land and serious about being business-minded and being a good steward for those that live and work on her land. Adrian and Ann are childhood friends, so they are hung up on the concept of friendship and business, despite what simmers beneath the surface for them both. The ending is oh-so satisfying. I would love to read one of Catmull\u2019s novels since I enjoyed this novella so much.<br /><br />I highly recommend this collection to readers of historical romance. This is the first Timeless Victorian Collection that I\u2019ve read, but I\u2019ll definitely be looking for more of the books in this series.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this collection from the publisher; a positive review was not required, and these are my honest thoughts and opinions.", "images": [], "asin": "B0BD9GVVTL", "parent_asin": "B0BD9GVVTL", "user_id": "AEDEGXNI55CMSJOGB7MUCO6AVU2A", "timestamp": 1667759150761, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Thaws Out Nicely", "text": "A headless and partially skinned horse is found hanging high up on a French mountain.  No ordinary horse, this is the prized thoroughbred of one of the richest men in France.  To further cloud things, DNA is found onsite from a notorious serial killer, who is incarcerated at a nearby insane asylum.  But no one \u2013 either where the horse was stabled or at the mountain \u2013 heard or saw anything.  As the police scramble to make sense of their enigmatic clues, human corpses start to turn up.<br /><br />This book is extremely effective and entertaining as a dark, moody, and rather terrifying thriller.  If your taste runs to fast pacing and lots of action, look elsewhere.  Here, you are brought into the lives of a group of detectives, doctors, and asylum inmates in a very fine detail.  There is a lot to keep track of, and things that seem unrelated at first become intriguingly intertwined.  The pace is very deliberate, sometimes lagging but then picking up with a burst of action.  The author uses suspense masterfully, keeping your curiosity and anxiety level balanced on a razor\u2019s edge.  In style and tone, this book more closely resembles a horror novel than your average mystery.<br /><br />There are a couple of odd points to note.  The original book was written in French, and it\u2019s been translated into British-English.  This brings us to Monsieur this or Madam that saying things like \u201crighty-ho\u201d, which certainly gives you pause while reading.  The police are methodical, but somewhat languorous in the way we often imagine Frenchmen to be.  There are also some lingual inaccuracies, such as when the dead horse is taken in for an autopsy, rather than a necropsy.  And there is an epilogue which introduces some bizarre and totally unexpected details, which could have probably been left out altogether.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I would not recommend it for young adult readers, because the subject matter is genuinely disturbing.  If you would like a nice, scary mystery to spend a few hours with, give this one a try.", "images": [], "asin": "1250045533", "parent_asin": "1250045533", "user_id": "AE3TGLPVBPR2KSOGYZUKPKFNQSHA", "timestamp": 1402151511000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Movie Music Making", "text": "I read this book by mistake!<br /><br />I\u2019m a lone-wolf video shooter.  I have a small background in music: I play (without much skill) several instruments; have studied (at a rudimentary level) music composition;  can use Adobe Audition with a little skill. But music is the weakest part of my videos. I wanted to learn more about video and movie music to improve my videos. The blurb for this book talked about going beyond technique so I started reading.<br /><br />The book is aimed at people interested in being part of the process of making movie music as composers, music editors, music supervisors and perhaps even as film editors. It takes the form of twenty interviews with people in these professions.<br /><br />There is a remarkable similarity in what they say. Don\u2019t get into this business unless you really love it. You will have to spend long hours at work. You will have periods when you can\u2019t get a job.  Movie music making is a collaborative process, but not without friction. It can be tough on your personal life. It can provide great joy. Networking is important.<br /><br />The book is clearly aimed at those who think they want to enter the movie music professions. Although unsaid, I\u2019m sure there are many folks who had that aspiration and have turned to other things. Perhaps they would have given up the dream before trying if they had read this book (and believed it).<br /><br />The interviews themselves don\u2019t appear to have been edited very much, but in some ways, that adds a ring of truth to what is said. Saltzman has a set of basic questions that he asks but like most good interviewers he will go off his planned path when he hears something interesting. Occasionally, the interviews sound so similar that it\u2019s hard to distinguish them. That just adds to the verisimilitude.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Saltzman did not provide black letter definitions of composer, music editor and music supervisor. That may be because there is so much overlap. I suspect that this did not significantly impair the usefulness of this book.<br /><br />For what it\u2019s worth, I read an electronic version of the book on the publisher\u2019s Vital Source Bookshelf software. It is quirky and a bit frustrating to use.<br /><br />I can\u2019t recommend this book to anyone not contemplated a career in movie or video music.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Critically Important Secrecy!", "text": "In 1933 when Adolph Hitler came to power, Albert Einstein, a Jewish professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences was visiting the United States. Einstein did not return to Germany, but, remained in the United States and became a naturalized citizen in 1940. At about that same time upon the eve of the full breaking out of World War II, Einstein endorsed a letter to then President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt informing him that scientists in Germany were on the verge of developing &#34;extremely powerful bombs of a new type&#34;. This lead to the establishment of the highly secretive Manhattan Project to begin intensive research into this critically important scientific field. Three widely separated remote areas of the United States: Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Los Alamos, New Mexico and Richland (Hanford), Washington were chosen as locations for the research and development locations for this project. In each location many parcels of private property were taken by the Federal Government by imminent domain, sometimes done so quickly that time was barely allowed for existing crops to be harvested. In the State of Washington, the residents of the small towns of Richland, Hanford and White Bluffs had to be relocated. In 1943 Richland had a population of 243. By the time that this new government facility reached peak production, in less than two years, the population was 51,000. Security and secrecy were so intense and enforced that workers had no idea about the product or even if there was a product on which they were working. Rumors were everything from campaign buttons to toilet paper. The bomb tested at the Trinity Site, near Alamogordo, New Mexico on July 16, 1945, contained plutonium from Hanford. The bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 1945, also contained plutonium manufactured at the Hanford plant. Some days later when Japan surrendered the local paper announced what had been actually going on at Hanford. This book is a fascinating insight into those days and how Richland developed afterward.", "images": [], "asin": "0738520616", "parent_asin": "0738520616", "user_id": "AHOHRKO43QRJP4K77KAXQYLF6HSA", "timestamp": 1444169766000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Beautiful book - a bit pricey", "text": "I really love the recipes in this cookbook. I own most of the other Cambodian cookbooks that are currently available to Westerners, as well as a few, such as Elephant Walk, that are currently out of print. I find that this book does not repeat the recipes that are in the other books, for the most part, except for a few staple recipes. I also like the author's approach to make the recipes authentic, but with ingredients that are more accessible to the US audience to which it is targeted. For example, one appetizer uses grape leaves to wrap, instead of Yucca leaves, that the author knows will not be easily available to most.<br /><br />The reason that I am giving this book only four stars is that the price for this book is quite expensive for what it is. I have hundreds of cookbooks, and this book is overpriced. I understand that this is not the authors fault, but at $39.95 for a paperback book, with non-glossy pages, that is little over a hundred pages, I do think that the publisher is exaggerating a bit!<br /><br />I do still consider myself lucky to have this cookbook, as it has some great recipes, and it is one of the few books on Cambodian cuisine out there. I would also recommend searching for the Elephant Walk cookbook by Longteine \"Nyep\" de Monteiro, which has some excellent recipes as well.<br /><br />Post note - I do also wish that the author had mentioned that if you are able to find taro leaves in your market - PLEASE COOK THEM.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Recommended only for beginning writers who can't come up with a topic", "text": "I purchased this text because it was required reading for a creative writing class. After reading several of the chapters, I find myself disappointed with it.  Although Miller and Paolo do provide a useful overview of different styles of nonfiction, as well as references to strong writers within the genre, I was less impressed with their suggestions for a new writer.  The book tends towards the overly flowery, from my point of view, and has some writing prompts that I find ridiculous or overly simplistic.  In a chapter on writing about family, for example, one prompt encourages the writer to \"describe every member of your family in terms of a part of the body ... Look at belly buttons, fingerprints, moles, toe-nails, or tongues\" (23). Another section asks the writer to create an essay around three time periods in the person's life, all written in present tense, before trying to find a connection between them. While I don't doubt that effective essays can be written around the prompts in the book, I did not find them helpful in addressing the different ideas in which I am personally invested.<br /><br />I should note that I am a graduate student and have taken several nonfiction classes, so my expectations for the text are possibly different than those of someone looking for an introduction to creative nonfiction. If you want to write nonfiction but struggle to come up with your own topic, then this book's basic prompts might be helpful to get you started (before you hopefully move on to other texts).  If, however, you already have ideas but want better advice on how to strengthen your actual writing, I do not recommend this work at all.<br /><br />Instead, may I suggest [[ASIN:0393326659 In Fact: The Best of Creative Nonfiction]], edited by Lee Gutkind, which is a wonderful anthology of creative nonfiction?

{"rating": 4, "title": "Interesting characters, unlikely ending", "text": "Geraldine Brooks' novel, Year of Wonders, offers a compelling story of considerable hardships, trials, and experience of human nature under extreme circumstances. There were several strengths to the novel and a few flaws that in my mind kept the novel from obtaining 5 stars.<br /><br />One considerable strength to the novel is the development of the character of Anna Frith, one of the most level-headed female characters in English literature since Elizabeth Bennett in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. We see the world through this woman of high intelligence and astute observational ability. Brooks develops a cast of characters that is broad and compelling. Even though there are multiple characters of all classes and dispositions, the reader seems to be able to visualize them and keep them straight.<br /><br />There are however a few weaknesses to the novel that keep it from getting a 5 out of 5 score. One of these is that there often too many heroic actions on the part of Anna Frith, making her seem unrealistic at times. I am certain this aspect of the novel may make Anna a highly compelling and likable character for many readers, but too much heroism becomes suspect. For example, Anna and another woman put on men's clothes and mine ore so a poor orphan girl doesn't lose her inheritance. Having never been in the mines, they obtain a full day's worth of ore and use a highly dangerous method of mining with no experience with explosives. Unfortunately the ending is also highly unlikely and is actually the most unsatisfactory portion of the novel.<br /><br />I remained entertained throughout the novel but I reached several points in the book where I became frustrated with the heroine engaging in too many deeds that were unrealistic and which bordered on fantasy.", "images": [], "asin": "0142001430", "parent_asin": "0142001430", "user_id": "AE7ES2UA5N2JCEHUR5MZ6IU5RZ6A", "timestamp": 1235521487000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 5, "title": "The Financial Prophesy of 2000 Seen Too Late", "text": "Thomas Friedman has had the benefits of living and working across most of the world's cultural, financial and political spheres, and has learned to synthesize his reporting facts and insights in a fashion that most readers can digest. The Lexus and The Olive Tree was published in 1999, and examines the building financial concentration of monetary power of corporate businesses in their relationship to country and global governance.<br /><br />The Lexus is used as a symbol for how everyone appear content to us the trading system we know Anno 2020 as Globalization as a means to acquire personal wealth and security, and the Olive Tree is used as a reference to our individual needs to retain a sense of local color, culture and tradition.<br /><br />He introduced readers to the power and speed a global herd of financial traders use to punish and adjust to their will and norm any country, region or business that does not conform to the accounting standards adopted by, mostly, US institutions such as Moody's. This herd, according to his reporting, now possess more power than big countries or armies, and are able to ruin or stop whole industries that are not meeting their analysis for generating profits quickly enough.<br /><br />He alludes to this with \"Today's markets are so big, so diverse and, with the advent of the internet, becoming so fast, that they can never be made immune from crisis. Global financial crisis will be the norm in this coming era (p371).' ...Because both booms and the busts will be coming faster.<br /><br />Oddly enough, or not, the author appear to believe that the only solution countries and their populations have with globalization is to shrug on the 'golden straight-jacket' and bend to the faster and faster changes driven by relentless technological innovation and the need for a narrow, profit driven basis of community.<br /><br />He does concede, in an America centrist manner, that America is, and will be, for the near future, the  Michael Jordan of geopolitics, but that we cannot thrive  without the rest of the world. In his concluding analysis he speaks of the concern that 'the hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist.' This refers, of course, to the overarching monopoly on military power held by the US.<br /><br />He quotes a Silicon Valley executive as 'I don't want to talk about unhealthy and unproductive people' as, perhaps, a thematic philosophy held by the financial and entrepreneurial global elites. As for the concerns over our ability to keep our sanity, customs, cultures and olive trees he suggests that it may be mostly to the degree that our McDonald's look a as local as possible. However, he does predict that \"you will star to see truly crazy revolts against monotony and standardization..'<br /><br />Mr. Friedman's book was a good read in 2000, but it may be an essential book in 2020-30 as all global communities examine their life styles, risks and employ-ability in the face of a financial global system that is so complex that no one can be identified as being in-charge. Likewise, it may be a survival issue for many Americans to re-examine the social networks adopted by EU countries where medical care and social security are not tied to an employer who may not be around long enough to securely fund social safety nets. Readers may also want to reflect on the destabilizing effects of global wars that have been primarily driven by commercial resource control goals by large corporations, and how this, along with climate change has created over 100 million of homeless, unemployed migratory people who are swarming the borders of the Western countries.", "images": [], "asin": "1250013747", "parent_asin": "1250013747", "user_id": "AHOXXWAEK5LA7ITVUMBFBTZGZA6Q", "timestamp": 1624415563478, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Hiroshima and The Bomb, a Primer", "text": "Though I had my general comments fixed in my head prior to putting pen to paper and reviewing Wallace\u2019s \u201cCountdown 1945\u201d (C45), I thought I\u2019d check what other readers had written to see if I could be persuaded to alter what I had in mind.  I skimmed many Amazon reviews and they were pretty much what I expected.  Overall, a 4.2 average rating which is a nice solid number but not a rave by any stretch, nor a clunk.  The distribution had two humps, a bit unusual.  A very high number of 5 stars as expected, but a surprisingly high number of 1 stars as well, with a deeper than usual valley in the middle.  So, a case of love it or hate it.  And I suspect after looking at some comments, both sides of the coin seemed to be occasionally influenced by political considerations.<br /><br />I\u2019ve read a fair amount of WWll history, and  I didn\u2019t learn much new in this book.  I should add that I have also visited some of the key sites described in the book, including the Trinity test area and Los Alamos (a small museum is one of the few reminders of what happened there).  I also visited the \u201creception office\u201d in Santa Fe where new hires were directed before transportation to their new \u201csecret home town\u201d, about 40-50 miles northwest.<br /><br /> C45 is a fast, easy read; it has only 276 pages, and many of those have photos.  Wallace skims over several issues, options and key players and teams, including the crew of the bomber, the Enola Gay.  Much of the writing is very anecdotal.<br /><br />Wallace tries to explain why he wrote this book, but that part of the book seemed a bit lame.  I read some speculation the this might be the first of a series of \u201cCountdown\u201d books.  Maybe Chris is going to school on one of his former Fox colleagues\u2026..?  I think this may be a good book for a high school student to read.  After all it does cover one of the most critical events of the last century, and one that we still live with today.

But Dita\u2019s brother Hal is convinced there is information surrounding his sister\u2019s death that remains buried \u2013 and he won\u2019t rest until he\u2019s discovered the truth.<br /><br />I\u2019ve long been a fan of Scott Turow\u2019s novels since many years ago I read the brilliant \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d He does write the most terrific legal mystery novels and this one was no exception to the rule.<br /><br />Mr Turow always writes with great depth when it comes to relationships and the emotional resonance of how events affect us, weaving a tale around people and places that is always compelling, clever and thrilling to read \u2013 here he explores the ties that bind identical twins. Cass and Paul are so alike and yet so very different \u2013 when Cass is released after serving a 25 year sentence for murder, they hope to rediscover their relationship and get on with life. They reckon without Hal, who is absolutely certain that the whole truth has yet to be revealed.<br /><br />I was immersed in this one immediately \u2013 I found both Cass and Paul to be extremely fascinating, their relationship being a naturally close one \u2013 and as the themes of family, betrayal, love and loss are explored here, the picture starts to become clearer\u2026or does it..<br /><br />As we follow along with the investigation undertaken by Hal\u2019s employee\u2019s and watch the legal battle unfold, it is captivating, highly entertaining and often emotional. Just what did happen on that fateful night all those years ago ? Cass may have confessed but Hal has no doubt that there is more to it \u2013 he is tenacious, difficult, unable to let go and often aggravating but he, also, is a completely fascinating character. Excellent storytelling and absolutely addictive.<br /><br />All in all another terrific read for me \u2013 I am one happy reviewer at the moment. Enjoy!<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!", "images": [], "asin": "1455527203", "parent_asin": "1455527203", "user_id": "AERKWOGXMBKGKSEZWT5CDWRDHQ3Q", "timestamp": 1396518606000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Fascinating!", "text": "\"[W]hat makes _Homo sapiens_ special and why we are the only human species alive is that we evolved a few slight changes in our hardware that helped ignite a software revolution that is still ongoing at an escalating pace.\"<br /><br />Lieberman, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard, develops this apt metaphor by examining the key physical transitions that separated us from apes and then the intellectual transitions that separated us from all other hominins. Life only gets better and better for us over millions of years as we become bipeds whose increased mobility allows foraging further distances for food, those better diets then leading to bigger brains and the strategic thinking necessary for hunting, tool-making, and eventually language and social cooperation.<br /><br />Only better and better ... until a couple of cultural transitions have mixed results: the agricultural revolution's huge increase of food supply and caloric density (but: sometimes famine) and population growth (but: sometimes infectious outbreaks from living densely with animals/people); the industrial revolution's relief of brutal physical labor (but: creation of obesity and \"under-use\" diseases). He asks, \"Has civilization led the human body astray?\" and answers, in a definite affirmative, via an exploration of the mis-matches between body and environment that are responsible for the bulk of today's healthcare spending, disabilities, and deaths.<br /><br />This book is a detailed scientific exploration of how we evolved to live and how we actually do live now, connecting the dots to show why we're in epidemics of infectious disease; heart disease; autoimmune disease; obesity; type 2 diabetes; cancer; osteoporosis; and dozens more. I'm very familiar with the current situation but the evolutionary backstory here was fascinating -- logically developed, conversationally presented, extensively (and entertainingly) endnoted, and completely accessible to the non-scientist reader.

{"rating": 5, "title": "A horror novel that walks the thin line between literary postmodernism and genuinely scary possession (?) tale", "text": "Paul Tremblay's\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0has been greeted rapturously by not only horror fans, but by more &#34;mainstream&#34; critics, which isn't something that normally happens with horror novels. Normally, horror is a bastard stepchild of a genre, something that most reviewers are &#34;above&#34; reviewing. And in the rare cases in which a book manages to overcome that barrier, it normally does so by being so &#34;literary&#34; that it loses the very things that appeal to horror fans. All of which is to say, it's notable that\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0manages to walk a very thin line, giving us something genuinely scary and creepy, but also something inventive and postmodern enough to make it appeal to those with a more literary bent.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for Tremblay's ambition to make itself known.\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0opens with Merry Barrett returning to her childhood home, accompanied by a writer who's helping her tell the &#34;official&#34; version of her story and what happened to her sister Marjorie. See, a lot of people\u00a0know\u00a0the story already, because Merry's childhood ended up being used as a reality television series called\u00a0The Possession, a huge hit up until...well, you'll see. So what we get in\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0isn't exactly an &#34;objective&#34; account of what happened to Marjorie and the Barretts; what we're getting is mostly Merry's memories, some of which, she admits, may have been influenced by the TV show, or may be things that she's lied about for so long she's struggled to remember the truth. And if that's not enough, Tremblay throws in some blog post analyses of the episodes of\u00a0The Possession from a horror fan, discussing the story not only as it was presented on television, but picking at all of the tropes Tremblay is tossing out.<br /><br />Indeed, there's little way to explain how much\u00a0fun\u00a0this book is to horror fans without getting into the way Tremblay picks apart his own influences and inspirations. Just as you're thinking &#34;this feels like a rip from\u00a0The Exorcist&#34; or &#34;do you think anyone in this book remembers the story 'The Yellow Wallpaper'&#34;, Tremblay uses the blog posts to make the allusions and references clear, laying out for all to see the DNA of the story, but also turning the book and story into something muddier and less clear. Did all of this happen? Is this all a case of people echoing movies and TV shows that shaped their perception of what &#34;possession&#34; was? Where does the truth come in?<br /><br />To Tremblay's credit - and to the irritation of many, I bet - there aren't a lot of clear answers here.\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0leaves a lot open to interpretation, down to the final pages, which are filled with moments that might - or might not - change everything. That could be frustrating for many, but for me, Tremblay's earned his ambiguity; this is a story about how we perceive things, and how motives aren't always cut and dry. There's no arguing about the events of the story - everyone agrees on those. What's more up for debate is what it all means, and what\u00a0caused\u00a0it all - and that's far more compelling fare.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt, though, that\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0is genuinely scary, maybe all the more so for our inability to understand why some of this is happening. Is Marjorie mentally ill, or is she possessed? Neither explanation is entirely satisfying, because neither can adequately explain some of the truly unsettling, disturbing events of the story - even our blog posts, doing their best to unpack the tricks of the TV trade, struggle on a few points. But that's okay; what makes the best horror is a degree of uncertainty, of unease as to what's really going on. It's just that few books make that part of the text itself, filtering the story through unreliable narrator after unreliable narrator until we're not sure who to believe. (It's no coincidence that Merry shares a nickname with one of horror's great unreliable narrators,\u00a0We Have Always Lived in the Castle's Merrycat.) All we know for sure is the horror that comes out of those primal, uneasy moments - and no explanation is going to help make any more sense out of some of it.", "images": [], "asin": "B00MTSKHKO", "parent_asin": "B00MTSKHKO", "user_id": "AESESBLLG3ZZISQONG5SOAEUGC3Q", "timestamp": 1508002920960, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 2}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Short, Simple, and Beautiful", "text": "\"Rock Crystal\" is a simply amazing little book. Adalbert Stifter shows his narrative skill in starting with a description of the Austrian mountains, then moving to a description of two villages in neighboring valleys, then to two separate individuals- a shoemaker in one village and a much-sought lady in another- who eventually become married, and then to the protagonists- the couple's children- Conrad and Sanna. On Christmas Eve, they are to visit their grandmother across the mountain and be back by night. Unfortunately, there is unexpectedly heavy snow and they can't see through it and so lose their way. With not much on them except the coffee their grandmother gave them, they have to rely on Conrad's determination and whatever sign they can find from nature.<br /><br />One thing that I particularly enjoyed about \"Rock Crystal\" is how it illustrates that human life can be fragile in the face of nature.  Stifter's portrayal of the unforgiving mountains and snowstorm reminds me of the scenery in Jack London's work. Another enjoyable aspect of the book is that, despite the limited space, Stifter builds significant tension and makes the reader feel concerned for the characters; he never pulls any \"cheap tricks\" to do this, though. Finally, though religious references abound in the book, specifically Catholic liturgical ones, the story does not depend on any particular religious doctrine, and can be enjoyed simply as a story about how lucky we are to be alive.", "images": [], "asin": "159017285X", "parent_asin": "159017285X", "user_id": "AH3CRCHMK4IGCVNETUMPWN3E64FQ", "timestamp": 1254361199000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 3, "title": "More emotional depth to this vampire hunting series with good action hampered by a faltering and incomplete plot + worldbuilding", "text": "Vampire Bablyon is the start of a new vampire hunting series featuring a female stunt expert, Dawn Madison. The story is fast paced and filled with enough gory fight scenes to please the hard core urban fantasy reader but with a surprisingly emotional layer that may appeal to the female reader. It fails to deliver a complete world building construct and this coupled with the tendency to leave more plot threads open than resolved left this reader dissatisfied.<br /><br />Dawn is between stunt jobs when she finds out her father, Frank, is missing. She heads to LA and the PI firm of Limpet & Associates to find him. Assisted by a psycho midget,Kiko Daniels, and a gorgeous Hispanic tech guru, Briesi, Dawn begins to the hunt for Frank.  Dawn learns that there is a complete otherworld filled with psychics, vampires and the VOICE, who runs the show at the PI firm. Dawn must help to find her father; solve the mystery of a re-appearing child star that disappeared 12 years ago but has suddenly reappeared; resolve personal issues with her dead mother; fight vampires; discover who is behind the hiring of a second PI guy; figure out who the VOICE is; and save the world. Sound like a lot for one book? It is.<br /><br />There were two major problems that hindered me from really falling into the story. The world building, while interesting, is frustratingly incomplete. Also incomplete were the conclusion of the many plot threads introduce. In fact, only one was brought to a close. This is likely intentional in order to make a reader invest in the entire trilogy.<br /><br />What kept me reading was that Dawn was an interesting character. She is an acute observer and her descriptions of her world were detailed and rich.  She is conflicted with feelings of anger and remorse over a poor relationship with her father; and her identity and self-esteem issues that arise from being the daughter of a dead Hollywood icon.  In the end, I was intrigued about the next book because Dawn is an appealing narrator. I do want to find her peace and am willing to read at least one more book to find out more about her journey.

{"rating": 3, "title": "3.5 Stars", "text": "I was hesitant about requesting Saving Everest. Sometimes I look forward to dark stories that can move me emotionally, and sometimes they just end up draining me. In the case of Saving Everest, I did begin to wonder if the depression that Everest was suffering from was too much for my personal \"read for fun\" time. I mean his depression was bad enough to cause him to attempt suicide. But thankfully the story didn't stay here too long.<br /><br />I will say before moving on from that too much that we do see some of the things Everest was struggling with. His father is domineering, unsupportive, and harsh. His mother seems uninvolved or uninterested. He has friends and a girlfriend but I suppose we learn that they're not true friends. And he plays football, but I never really figured out if he hated football, the attention it brought him, or the pressure he felt to perform. So I found myself questioning how things got so bad for him to consider ending his own life. But maybe that was the point of it all? You're not really supposed to understand depression because it isn't always logical.<br /><br />It was a little hard for me to believe that Everest is completely surrounded by people who are so cold and callous. That ranging from close family to supposed friends to random strangers to teachers could all be very cold toward him and the things that he was struggling with. Again, thankfully the book didn't stay stuck in this place for too terribly long. But I did have to question that there weren't more people with softer hearts.<br /><br />Beverly was a breath of fresh air. She breathed life into the book just as much as she breathed life into Everest. I worried that things would be too literal with the title and Beverly single-handedly saving Everest from his depression. It's never a great idea to bank your entire happiness upon another person as that person could be taken from you at any time. And while Beverly does change things for Everest, I don't think the credit is only hers.<br /><br />I was a little confused as to how Nami could be popular enough socially to be student body president when she seemed to be so abrasive to so many people. Of course, I came to really enjoy her character.<br /><br />Saving Everest had moments that felt like continuity errors to me. Some I've already mentioned. Also, Everest complained at one point about the pressure to perform with football and how he'd come to hate people approaching him and praising him based off the game, yet when he turned to singing the same thing happened. He put pressure on himself to be perfect, to perform. And he constantly had more and more people approaching him in response to his music. At the same time, especially toward the end of the book, I felt like there were entire missing pieces of the story. A little more polish would have helped.<br /><br />All of that being said, I read Saving Everest pretty fast. I didn't want to stop. As a matter of fact, I stayed up a little late two nights just to keep reading. It wasn't a perfect read for me. I felt some pieces were missing and others were contradictory. But overall, I loved Everest and Beverly. Saving Everest gets 3.5 Stars. Have you read Saving Everest? What did you think?

{"rating": 2, "title": "What a Disappointment", "text": "Ever since I heard Eric Cheng make a presentation at a photography conference six months ago, I've been learning to use my Phantom Vision 2 Plus as a platform for photography. The manufacturer's instruction booklet, its web site and You Tube helped me to learn the mechanics of flying the bird, although the difference between home lock and course lock flying was particularly difficult to learn. But with the exception of a few videos by Russell Brown, I couldn't find much useful about aerial photography technique and nothing about the aesthetics aspects. I anxiously awaited this video and companion book.<br /><br />The video has a broad overview introduction, and sections on maintenance, flight software, flight basics, and last (and least), setting up cinematic and photographic shots. However the videos seem more like an advertisement for the manufacturer than any real attempt to teach.<br /><br />The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used for demonstration purposes are the Phantom 3 and the Inspire so if you've got an earlier model, you'll have to infer from the information provided.<br /><br />The package did not include any instructions for loading the video, other than system requirements which I met. I had a difficult time getting the videos to run on my older computer, but that wasn't a problem, since many of the features of the base software, like \"watch and work\" are not applicable to this video. I finally ended up extracting the zip files to my computer and using Windows Media Player to watch the files in order.<br /><br />Most of the information provided was quite superficial. For example, the chapter on software did not tell you how to download the necessary software, or how to calibrate the compass.<br /><br />Other than gee-whiz videos, the photographic section illustrates six types of shots, like the reveal, the crane and the tilt, but provided no instructions on when the shot would be useful or how to handle the vehicle to get such shots. There was no mention of post-processing UAV images. If you want to learn how to photograph from a UAV be prepared to read lot of other books about straight photography and videography and apply the lessons to UAV photography.<br /><br />I can't resist offering you a couple of tips that should have been in the book: think of the vehicle as a device for putting the camera in a position to take a particular shot, like a really giant tripod; and, the lens correction function in Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw will straighten out the distortion inherent in the on-board camera's wide angle lens.<br /><br />The companion book is scheduled for publication on October 16.

Unfortunately, I found nothing nice about this book.<br />There's no real character development, and much of what is done doesn't paint a very empathetic picture.<br />From the beginning we're supposed to be excited for Gen's big opportunity with the boss-man after just a few short pages.  We know nothing about him except that he's good-looking, wealthy, and a womanizer.  Not much to have you rooting for him / them.<br />We'll skip over the implausibility of Nick taking 2 possible witnesses along on his D.B. Cooper adventure, the hocus-pocus of Annabelle & Lincoln's \"psychic\" powers, and the atrocious attempt to throw in a little \"hillbilly-ese\".  (Honestly, those alone are reason enough to warn future readers to run away.)<br />But, let's delve further into the book (not head first, way too shallow for that...)<br />We have two central characters, Gen and Jack, neither of which is all that likeable.<br />Gen is a sex-starved, superficial, egotistical, condescending, hillbilly whose years of shame over her roots are supposedly overcome in just a few short hours.<br />Jackson / Jack is a hapless, love-struck puppy who puts up with Gen's bad behavior because he's so enamoured with her.  For the life of me I couldn't figure out what he saw in her.  We are to assume a nerd is smart - shouldn't he be smart enough to demand a woman treat him with respect?<br />So, despite her poor opinion of him, Gen is pawing at Jack within mere hours of her stranding.  But before she does, she must smugly assume that she is a master at lovemaking and the poor nerd must be wholly and completely inexperienced.  Because really, who on this Earth would deign to be with a man who isn't fresh off the pages of GQ?  Oh wait, now I remember: intelligent women who care more about being with a good man that treats them well than about being with the prettiest man around.<br />I tried hard to like this book and I tried equally hard to put it down.  But, unfortunately, once I start something I must finish it, so I was stuck with Gen and Jack and Nick and Annabelle and Matt and Lincoln till the bitter end.  Curiously, the only characters I actually identified with were Matt and Lincoln, but they were mere afterthoughts.<br />I understand this was the author's first attempt to move beyond Harlequin-type romances.  Perhaps she was daunted by the empty pages at hand, perhaps she thought the extra pages would allow for multiple sub-plot development, perhaps she got side-tracked with all the various characters with their various gimmicks, perhaps she was struck by Grisham-itis and found she had 5 pages to wrap up a 300 page novel.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Too Much Line Work Is Already Filled In Black When You Get It- Sad", "text": "Fair warning: really detailed pictures like an adult would want but most all the pictures have an extreme excess of black ink already filled in to each picture....in other words- it's supposed to be line work for you to color- but some genius has already filled in huge gaps in each picture with dark black ink which prevents you from in fact making your own color choices; defeating the purpose of why you got the book in the first place. People get intricate coloring books so they can color the line work themselves- here it's been done for you in many spots- in a black so deep that even coloring over it wouldn't help.  They should have left the designs open with just line work.  The publisher made a big mistake filling in so much for you with dark as night black ink thus denying you the chance to pick your own colors.  The more I leaf through this book the more disappointed I become. Like the art but it's really more a picture book than a coloring books because of the way it was printed. Don't be fooled; your ability to color this book in is somewhat limited- and that's being generous.  Could have been a lot better.  Why do publishers feel they have to fill in solid black ink for grown people when even less intricate books use just line work so you can actually color? Meh- im getting out the Flintstone coloring books I bought here and using those. Why? Because at least they are not already colored in for me as this book is.  Wasted opportunity.  In a coloring book the black ink goes on the lines- not inside the picture itself; as this is supposed to be a coloring book not a graphic art book or a comic book where the inker adds shading.  In a coloring book the end user can add all the black pigment he wants in ways he chooses with his own tools- it does not need to be done by the publisher.  The more ink filled in for you the less coloring you get to do. Of course Spawn is a dark comic; but this is not a comic book- it's a version for people to color, which means people would like to make their own hue choices- not have a lot of spaces inked in ahead of time.  If people want to add more black they're  capable of doing that on their own.  If people wanted ink work done for them they'd buy a comic book or art book- not a coloring book.  Just because Spawn is a 'dark character' doesn't mean a coloring book about him has to have dark ink filled in instead of just  on the line work where it belongs. Sometimes his costume itself is portrayed as being quite bright in the books and movies in spite of the situations so him being a dark character is no reason at all to put out a coloring book with so much space already filled in. If there's going to be black ink on the sketches the reader is supposed to color it should be on the line design only as with most coloring books. Just because a character has a dark mood to his likeness doesn't mean a colorist should have to suffer an excess of black fill-in when he can do that for himself and indeed that is what people are paying for when they buy a coloring book- elaborate art that they can choose all the colors for and fill in themselves.  This isn't a comic book so the colorist should be able to create whatever mood they want- but here a lot of each picture is already filled in so you don't have the latitude of most other adult coloring books.  What could the publisher have done and still stayed true to the character?  Reprinted the sketches and inked over just the line work if need be.  Here they got too carried away with the ink- this isn't a comic book- it's not supposed to be; and even in the books there are often bright colors- not every panel/picture is soaked in black.  And if people want huge blocks of black they can do it themselves in a coloring book without the publisher deciding for them.  It's a shame great sketches were treated this way.", "images": [], "asin": "1632157853", "parent_asin": "1632157853", "user_id": "AFEUD6CALAUCYZ6R7ZENC2MOAVGA", "timestamp": 1461192148000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 2}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Wildly uneven mystery in a wildly uneven series", "text": "I'm accustomed to mystery writers whose books get steadily better, or steadily slide off in terms of quality, and I'm always delighted to find one who is consistently good. But Conor Fitzgerald doesn't fall into any of these categories. I struggled to finish his debut novel, [[ASIN:1608190544 The Dogs of Rome: A Commissario Alec Blume Novel]], but absolutely loved the second in the series[[ASIN:1608198499 The Fatal Touch: A Commissario Alec Blume Novel]], despite having had to force myself to pick it up. That tale -- which begins with the mysterious demise of an elderly Irishman in a Roman piazza -- was told in part through the eyes of Caterina Mattiola, and so we see Commissario Alec Blume, her boss, through fresh eyes. That shift in viewpoint worked for me, and the book as a whole as a lively, smart and intriguing mystery,  with a complex plot involving art fraud, corruption and bureaucratic nonsense.<br /><br />So I was eager to read the third in the series -- only to find myself plodding through a novel that had all of the faults of the first -- and more -- and few of the redeeming characteristics of the second book. It's a confusing mishmash of plot elements, beginning with the murder of a man whose only crime seems to have been sharing the same name as the new magistrate that Blume has been working with on some cases. Did the Mafia do it? Caterina ends  up taking a back seat in the story, even as she investigates this murder, while Blume is dispatched by some shady Intelligence operatives alongside a German cop on vacation in an antique camper van, in what kind of starts to feel like a comic road caper. Interspersed with all this is a strand of the plot told through the eyes of the adolescent son of a member of one of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates. There's a lot going on here, and Fitzgerald didn't make following the various strands very easy.<br /><br />Most problematic for me, however, was that in this third novel, Blume himself simply comes across as a reckless jerk much of the time. And he's a jerk with no real motivation -- he's behaving irresponsibly and foolishly in both his personal and professional life, and as a reader, I never really understood why. He's on the verge of moving into Caterina's home, but doesn't keep in touch with her -- and we don't really understand why. He does something reckless and dangerous in order to flush out a Mafia boss, deliberately putting someone's life in jeopardy -- and it wasn't clear to me just why he had done so, other than sheer cussedness. Now, being a jerk is fine -- I don't need characters in novels to be wholly admirable folks out to save the world -- but an author needs to make their behavior convincing by paying attention to character development. We know that Blume is tormented by losing his parents at a young age and being stranded on his own in Italy (he's American by birth), but how might that have led to these particular actions?<br /><br />So this was a frustrating book to read, especially after I had really enjoyed its predecessor. I'm back to wondering whether this is a series to be curious about or avoid in future. There's still room for Fitzgerald to do a great job with this series by streamlining his plots and paying more attention to character development, and there's a lot to like here in his mastery of the setting and the issues. But I'm glad I got this one from the publisher via NetGalley.", "images": [], "asin": "1608198456", "parent_asin": "1608198456", "user_id": "AH4PHUQB5OQ4ALDY7RQVLIC67M7A", "timestamp": 1342155924000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Half Cliche, Half Textbook", "text": "Mr. Westerfeld is the creator of the immortal \"Uglies\" trilogy - a sharp, science-fiction YA about a dystopia centered around plastic surgery and the rebels who are living natural \"ugly\" lives. This novel is not about that. This is about vampires. Sort of.<br /><br />It's more about parasites. Well, let me explain this way. Half the book is facts about parasites that read like those tidbit sections you might see in a Biology textbook or Highlights magazine with the title \"Did You Know?\" The other half is some teenager who's been infected with a parasite that gives him all the benefits of being a vampire and none of the weaknesses (except being horny all the time, which doesn't really figure into the plot and is par for the course for any teenager). He works for a secret underground organization, and has to find all his old girlfriends who have become ghouls because he accidentally gave the parasite to them.  Then he has to find his first girlfriend, the one who gave him the curse (whoops, tripped over the allegory in the doorway. Silly me). Then he does a lot of exploring, and he ends up realizing the kindly secret conspiratorial underground organization who took him in has been hiding information and manipulating him all the time. Didn't see that coming.<br /><br />This book was full of meh. There was too much description, too much trying to create dread. And you can't do that in a YA book that's full of slang and goofy teenagers. And there was a severe lack of vampires for a story about vampires. Lots of parasites, cats, and rats, but no vampires being vampires. And the whole MIBs in an underground war has been done to death, and it's no better here. I found myself looking forward to the educational sections about gross parasites and how they help and hurt nature. It's an adult story dumbed down to a YA level, and leaves you unsatisfied.

He leaves her cold, but not before sweet River pulls out the stops, and they have cataclysmic sex one last time.

No. No. No. He calls her, \u201cdoll\u201d all the blasted time. Straight out of youse Guys and Dolls.<br /><br />Four years later, Vaughn receives a letter that he has a three year old daughter. He rushes to his old town where doll hardly gives him a hard time. They have sex almost instantly, and while sexy with sexy talk, the sex seems a little painful to me.<br /><br />Vaughn vacillates between wanting to be there and feeling he should leave as he is soooo baaaaadddd, soooo unworthy.

Vaughn gets a grip, FINALLY, but I stopped caring before then. Poor doll, she's going to have her hands full with this one.

The alternate chapters in italics with the suicide watcher, glorifies and justifies their sick game.<br /><br />The other alternating chapters focus on a couple Elise and Nathaniel, and the murder of their teen daughter, Ida. These chapters are further bifurcated into \u201cthen\u201d (before Ida\u2019s murder) and \u201cnow\u201d (after the murder). Independently, the couple is also going through their own past issues and mental health traumas with a lot of people involved around them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found the novel to be a spaghetti mess of characters,  events and mental health issues. There were way too many characters involved with problems of their own, trying to find their place around the murder where it wasn\u2019t necessary. Also it felt like there was little cohesion in the timeline of events and it got too confusing to keep up. The final reveals also seemed unrealistic. Most importantly, the symptoms of some mental disorders are not accurate.<br /><br />To me, the only redeeming quality (hence the 2 stars) was the chapters focused on the suicide watcher up until before the final reveal.

Part of me kept asking, &quot;And why NOW are we reading some of these old essays?&quot;  But, since I love Wolfe's writing, I could forgive him some moments of indulgence.  I liked the Bragg piece and the New Yorker bits and the hooking up essay, but some of the other ones are actually dull in parts -- except for the writing I guess you'd say.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Excellent period detail swamps the plot & characters", "text": "Perhaps I was one of only a few readers who came to this without having read Ford's previous novel, [[ASIN:0345505344 Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet]]. After reading this subsequent book, however, my temptation is not to bother rushing out to buy that book, but wait to pick it up at the library one week when I don't have anything more appealing clamoring for my attention.<br /><br />That's because this novel left me strangely cold. Many of the basic plot elements -- the young Liu Song battling the odds to survive as a Chinese-American woman and single mother in 1920s and 1930s Seattle -- reminded me a bit too much of some of the family epics by authors like Belva Plain that I read back in the 1980s -- the details varied, of course, but the trials and traumas felt oddly formulaic. Nor did the quest by young William to find the elusive Willow Frost, now a screen star of pre-Hollywood 'talkies', believing her to be his long-vanished mother, feel terribly convincing to me. It was all mildly interesting, but never very persuasive and never as completely engaging as even many less well-written novels are.<br /><br />In contrast, the writing and the evocation of the period -- Seattle, in the transition from boom to Depression, and the very early years of movie-making -- were very appealing. The result was a mixed bag: a novel whose characters never came truly alive for me and who felt more like a collection of sad/tragic experiences than real individuals, but with a backdrop that was deeply interesting. The result was a not-terribly memorable book, alas, at least for this reader.<br /><br />Given the universal praise for Ford's previous work, perhaps this is another example of the \"sophomore slump\": a novelist and/or publisher rushing to capitalize on the runaway success of one book by pushing out a second as quickly as possible, even if it doesn't measure up. Reading this wasn't a traumatic experience, to be sure, but it didn't make me think, wow, what a great discovery, or make me want to hit the \"buy now\" button on any of his other work instantly.", "images": [], "asin": "0345522028", "parent_asin": "0345522028", "user_id": "AH4PHUQB5OQ4ALDY7RQVLIC67M7A", "timestamp": 1384651534000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

Not just any girl, but a futuristic Nun who helps pretty much the whole world and is the sweetest and most kind person ever.  The hero is ultimately emasculated to wear an alien bra to breast feed the baby of the dead mother (Nun Pun), a baby sired by the evil Muslim rapist father, all while hopelessly trapped on an island inside a space ship, which is itself one giant bad acid trip.  Seriously, WTF?  Science fiction is an existential metaphor that allows us to tell stories about the human condition.  It's supposed to help us imagine other possibilities and a better tomorrow.

Armies of knights and their retainers swarmed the land, destroying hapless farms and towns in their wake and engaging in bloody battles. Not to mention external enemies like France and Scotland, or the feuds over sections of the European  continent left over from the Norman invasion of 1066.

After a time in France, he returns home to discover his lands confiscated and virtually destroyed by Prince John, who is filling in while Richard is crusading. The rest of the series revolves around his efforts to win them back and restore his family's reputation.

Author Brette Sember proves that is indeed the case, turning out everything from Candied Yams and Chicken Tortilla Pie to Scallop Bites, portioning them out using various sizes of muffin pans.<br /><br />Cooking things other than muffins and cupcakes in muffin tins is nothing particularly new.  Betty Crocker's early 1960's Dinner For Two cookbook featured individual meatloaves baked in muffin tins and baked eggs, with or without a bologna cup underneath, were quite common during the 50's and 60's.  Grandma does have to wonder, though, why on earth one would bother with some of this.<br /><br />The Cocktail Meatballs started life decades ago as a stunningly easy and delicious slow cooker recipe.  This is one Grandma has been making for many years.  A mere dozen meatballs baked in individual muffin cups seems both terribly messy (the meatballs are cooked in a sauce of grape jelly and barbecue sauce) and FAR short of the number required for even a very small party.  Every time Grandma has ever served these or seen them served they are the very first appetizer to disappear - no matter how many you make.  Grandma usually starts with five pounds of ground meat.<br /><br />Chicken Tortilla Pie is just fussy.  One starts by cutting 18 little circles out of 3 large flour tortillas.  A recipe for Tuna Burgers calls for baking them in regular sized muffin cups, to produce a burger that is about 2\" across, which the author then suggests serving on hamburg buns . . . . .  wouldn't that teeny, slider sized \"burger\" in the center of a hamburg bun be cute?<br /><br />Baking individual portions of things in muffin tins is a nice little gimmick to spice up your party nibbles, but there is such a thing as way too much of a good thing, sort of like serving three different fondues at the same one party.  Overkill.<br /><br />The book is entirely printed in red-orange, very hard to read, particularly in the smaller print of the notes and the index, for which Grandma had to drag out reading glasses.<br /><br />There are very few pictures, all of them located in an eight page spread in the center of the book, featuring some of the very worst food photography - or even photography in general - that Grandma has ever seen, with most of the photos so out of focus they are fuzzy.<br /><br />All in all, [[ASIN:1440532168 The Muffin Tin Cookbook: 200 Fast, Delicious Mini-Pies, Pasta Cups, Gourmet Pockets, Veggie Cakes, and More!]] feels gimmicky and not particularly well thought out.<br /><br />Not recommended", "images": [], "asin": "1440532168", "parent_asin": "1440532168", "user_id": "AE4XWDMQ4GPQ2CUMNBZRU47S7EOQ", "timestamp": 1343919333000, "helpful_vote": 40, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 3, "title": "An interesting read", "text": "This collection of philosophical views reagarding the differant asspects of war, specifically nuclear war is a very interesting read.  If you remember the 60's and the turmoil of those times then these writings published in 1969 will bring back some of those times.  The essays (18 of them) cover, The War System, The Causes of War as well as other aspects of war.  The different Proffesors of Philosophy all write with an aim to show why war is the way it is, why we fight or why it is unjustified or what must happen to stop further wars.  Some it can easily be seen are biased in one way or another in their views and they let that come through, however this is not true of all the writers.<br /><br />By far the best essay is National Sovereignty and International Anarchy by Paul Arthur Schilpp.  It is a look at the way in which the sovereignty that nations claim is also a source of anarchy internationally because no true enforcable international laws/rules exist to cause nations to interact respectfully and peacefully with each other.  They can and do make and break treaties at will and for any reason.<br /><br />True hard line philosophy people may find this book not to their liking.  However, it is a interesting look and viewpoint regarding war and nuclear war from a time when their was a very serious concern that any day may be the final day before nuclear holocaust.  These times were full of competing view points on war and the Vietnam War was in full swing with protests all over college campuses acroos America.  These respected people were attempting to send out an educated outlook on war and its purpose and use in modern times.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Good in debunking the myth behind millionaires, but...", "text": "It was interesting to learn that the people with high net worth were not generally those who look that way -- according to the surveys the authors conducted, wealthy people were most often those who didn't appear wealthy. The secret of their high net worth, the authors contend, is that they are PAWs (\"Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth\"), or in other words frugal, those who save or invest a much higher percentage of their income compared to the rate they consume. The authors even go ahead to redefine what it is to be wealthy. Congruent to the results of their study, \"wealthy\" people are exactly those who continue to accumulate no matter what their income, and are not those who currently possess much but do not accumulate. Though simple at first sight, I found their new definition to be useful, and this much I can say that I have gained from the book.<br /><br />However the lesson I mentioned I learnt is just about everything the book offers. There is no so to say royal way to make money other than being frugal, evading tax as much as one can, and allocating as much time and energy to financial planning as possible, the authors claim. Perhaps this is the reason why the second chapters on appear redundant. The car example the authors quote repeatedly throughout the book is typical in this regard. It was indeed interesting to learn that the Ford pickup model was the most popular (and not some conspicuous foreign made high performance car) among the millionaires surveyed, but calculating the cost per pound of a good fraction of the cars currently available in the market? The very first time the authors wrote about \"you aren't what you drive,\" I got the message. It would have been much more educational if the authors instead included a study on the distribution of the industries those millionaires worked in (there is a such list at the end of the book, but no distribution statistics).<br /><br />Speaking of examples, I found some statistical results curious. For instance, in a early chapter of the book where the authors present a study on the ancestry groups of the millionaires surveyed (to ultimately claim that millionaires are mostly self-made) I could not find data for Afro Americans, Hispanics, or Asians. It is plausible that these ethnic groups (representing 28%+ of US population as of 2000) were not included because they did not have high percentage of millionaires per ethnic household and the table presented contained only the top ten in this measure. But recent studies of net worth stratified by ethnicity (for e.g. studies by L. Hao of Johns Hopkins Univ.) indicate Asian immigrants having higher median net worth compared to other US immigrant ethnic groups including Whites. Could it be that the majority of Asians are UAWs (the opposite of PAWs -- \"Under Accumulators of Wealth\")? As for a glaring omission. The authors assert that an overwhelming majority of millionaires they surveyed were self-employed. This much I am able to believe in good faith. But what exactly is the ratio between self-employed and not (for e.g. physicians, lawyers, engineers etc)? Wouldn't this ratio be more meaningful than including the types of credit cards those millionaires hold?<br /><br />The strength of this book compared to others in the same category is in that the authors conducted real field work. Some results were revealing, but as noted earlier, many of them were redundant. It would be interesting to read a volume on the same subject that does not try too hard to appeal to the general public.", "images": [], "asin": "0671015206", "parent_asin": "0671015206", "user_id": "AEIC46UGS2IWFT6MG6QDF4IPUTCQ", "timestamp": 1107249022000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

The actual \"Fiji Mermaid\" was quite different from what she'd expected but unforgettable in its own right.<br /><br />Emile Guillaudeu is a middle-aged taxidermist employed by The American Museum in New York. When his lifelong friend, the museum owner, sold the museum to P. T. Barnum, Emile stayed with the museum but nurses a grudge against both men for the changes wrought in his carefully ordered world.<br /><br />Over eight feet tall, Ana Swift is the world's only professional giantess. On the heels of a crushing disillusionment, she's come to New York to be one of the museum's exotic exhibits. Angry and defensive, Ana is used to being treated as a freak and doesn't quite know how to react when people don't conform to her expectations. Grudgingly grateful for the job, she hates Barnum for putting her on display.<br /><br />The book is a slice of life at the museum, told in a series of vignettes that don't really add up to an overall plot. Each set piece is beautifully told but there's not a lot of impetus to pull you through the story. Encounters occur and go unresolved, much like life. That said, many of the characters (particularly for me Tai Shan, Matthew of the cojoined twins and the beluga whale) are impossible to forget.<br /><br />I have a pet peeve about books with multiple narrators that lack distinct voices. That is absolutely not a problem here. Just a few lines out of context and you'll know which character you're reading.  Emile's sections are told in third person, so that helps, but Ana's language is plainer.

{"rating": 3, "title": "choppy writing detracts from story", "text": "Matthew Alcott had come from a prominent Mormon family in Salt Lake City.  Previously  married to the daughter of the stake president, he had been working as a historian in the archives of the L. D. S. church.  \"Took me three years to realize I was there to find and catalogue, nothing else.  I find it.  They hide it.\" (223)<br />But he found something they were not able to hide.  He discovered the last revelation of Joseph Smith.  It was written the last day of his life, June 27, 1844.  It had been hidden by Brigham Young under the cover leaf of one of his personal journals.<br />Smith had said that the ability to understand truth was inherited only by the male.  Only men had the genetic tissues of right thinking.  (224)  The revelation promoted polygamy.  \"Monogamy was the devil at work...\" (224)<br />Matthew is determined to write a book, an expose.  His marriage was over and he was being kicked out of the church.  Much of the novel is what happens to Matthew after he left Salt Lake City with the incriminating evidence.<br /><br />As with any novel, it is hard to know how much Oborn has written is based on fact and how much of conjecture.  Of Joseph Smith, he writes, \"Between 1841 and 1844 the guy manages to marry on average one a month.  Can you imagine?  We're talking 'busy.'  Some of those ladies had living husbands and children...\" (167)  Even with the federal cease and desist order in 1887, the polygamists went underground, Osborn writes.  One historian estimates fifty thousand descendants alive today from the polygamous marriages performed underground between 1890 and 1906.<br /><br />This is a roughly written novel.  Much of the dialog lacks verbs or pronouns.  About the Book of Mormon: \"Get a copy...skim the book.  Reading it, far too tedious.\" (169)  Elsewhere, Oborn starts a new paragraph, \"Had called little brother from his editor's office.\" (174)  I found the style of writing very disconcerting and hard to understand.<br /><br />The action jumps back in forth in time, too.  It is the present, then four years before, then the present, then childhood, then present - all in a few pages.  It made following the story more difficult, I thought.<br /><br />Also, there is language as well as scenes that would make this book not suitable for Christian readers, in general.<br /><br />Oborn says he wrote this book to entertain people with the women's issues playing a heavy subtext.  I found the book too difficult to read just not well crafted enough to enjoy it.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author for the purpose of this review.", "images": [], "asin": "1432788930", "parent_asin": "1432788930", "user_id": "AEVFBW5NOVVLLN3YA45DUU2FNNWQ", "timestamp": 1348199422000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Little Help?", "text": "Reading \"How Not to Write Bad\" by Ben Yagoda is an experience similar to hearing a recording of your voice on a tape recorder for the first time. *Gaaak!* That's how I sound?  *Aaargh!* I've been writing incorrect English all these years?<br /><br />If only I had a handbook on proper writing to help me mend my errant ways.<br /><br />It happens that I have several, and this one is no better than the rest. This book's utility evaporates once you discover a that it lacks an index.  Let's say that you are confused by the most common mistake in grammar: when to use *lay* and when to use *lie.* Nobody gets that right: I've had M.D.s tell me to *lay* down on the examination table.  \"Now I lay me down to sleep?\" [[ASIN:0394702549 As I Lay Dying]]? I laid in bed all morning? I'm lying there now? -- Help!  As far as I can tell, the only way to find the answer to this in \"How Not to Write Bad\" is to read the entire book, then dog-ear (dogear - Yagoda doesn't like hyphens) the page for future reference. I now have about twenty different pages so mutilated,<br /><br />The table of contents is of no use because of Professor Yagoda's fondness for using cutesie titles:<br /> 1. Sanitized<br /> 2. Skunked<br /> 3. Still Wrong<br /> 7. When You Catch a Preposition, Kill It<br /> 8. To Use to Be or Not to Use to Be<br /> 9. What the Meaning of \"Is Is\" Is<br /><br />Professor Yagoda does mention the lay/lie quandary, but he only devotes one short and inadequate paragraph to it, after which he maintains that that one should say, \"The Count Basie band really swang!\"  No one but an English professor ever spoke such a sentence. Even [[ASIN:B000TYXYAU my 1942 Dictionary]] lists *swang* as archaic.  He spends more time quoting mistakes from the papers of his students and putting screamingly unfunny titles above them.<br /><br />Professor Yagoda is also really persnickety -- but not where it counts. In contrast to his minimal explanation of lie/lay, he spends an entire page explaining that when you abbreviate 1960s (which he wisely observes has no apostrophe) to '60s, the apostrophe appears backwards in Microsoft Word. (I'm using [[ASIN:B00009L1HV AppleWorks 6.2.9]], so I'm not having that problem.)  He then provides detailed instructions for turning the single-quote mark into a comma. If you think that's the stupidest thing you ever heard of (I mean, who cares?), Professor Yagoda, starting a sentence with a conjunction, disagrees: \"But to me it counts as bad writing.\"<br /><br />He's obsessive-compulsive about that, but he neglects to mention other knotty problems with apostrophes. I agree with him (and so does the [[ASIN:B0011A5XAA The Associated Press Stylebook]]) that the '60s should have no apostrophe before the s. (Harry Shaw in [[ASIN:B004QOAD4E Punctuate It Right]] disagrees and advises putting an apostrophe before the s, and so does [[ASIN:B000FTAB3W Warriner's English Grammar and Composition]]. I can't find any mention of this in [[ASIN:0205313426 Strunk & White]].)  How is it then, that Professor Yagoda provides no advice on including apostrophes in the following sentences?<br />\u00a7 All players with 3's on their uniforms form a line here.<br />\u00a7 Mississippi is spelled with four s's, four i's, and two p's.<br />\u00a7 Count the number of and's in that paragraph.<br /><br />To find out what to do, you'll have to purchase a better book. The same is true of the problem of when to use *whom* instead of *who*.  Only one sentence is devoted to it. *Who?* He commands us to use asterisks in place of italics when only ASCII is available, but neglects to inform us if the final asterisk is placed inside or outside the punctuation.<br /><br />Professor Yagoda stands steadfast against against neologisms to the point that he warns against what he calls \"epicene pronouns,\" which I think are just fine, and he marks the following perfectly-good sentence incorrect: \"Arcade Fire and about 20,000 of their fans turned the PNC Center into a raucous party Thursday night.\"  Surely (he advises against using \"surely\") you've winced when some enlightened author uses *she* as a pronoun for a hypothetical hedge-fund manager or bomber pilot. Now that we have come to accept women as being more-or-less equal to men, there is an aching need in the language for a gender-neutral third-person personal pronoun, but still, Professor Yagoda admonishes, \"They're not acceptable now.\"<br /><br />Very well, but then, in his list of wrong words (pg.62), he advises against using *affect* instead of *impact*!  *Impact* as a verb! *Impact* as a synonym for *effect*!  >Impact!&lt; IMPACT! (Sloooowly I turned. . . . Step by step. . . . Inch by inch.. . .  ) The worst neologism to beset the poor language during our lifetime, and he embraces it !!?!  The scoundrel!<br /><br />Likewise, he says nothing about using \"utilize\" or \"usage\" in place of good-old simple \"use.\"  This is the worst murrain ever to have infested the language, and [[ASIN:B000ULXV4G Fowler's]] says of it, \"Those who write *usage* or *user* when they mean no more than *use* must be presumed to do so for one of two bad reasons: that they prefer either the longer word to the shorter or the unusual word to the common.\"  Professor Yagoda is very stern about not using multiple exclamation points, but he ignores \"utilize.\"  And you gonna >obey&lt; this guy?  (Since reading the latest novel by Tom Wolfe, I have decided that using the more-than and less-than symbols are a more effective way of emphasizing a word than *asterisks* in ASCII.  I make-up my own rules.)<br /><br />I began to think poorly of this book during the tedious introduction, when it became painfully obvious that Professor Yagoda writes like an English teacher. He makes-up all these rules then proceeds to violate each of them. He warns that ALL CAPS  is never an acceptable means of showing emphasis, but on page 69 he shouts, DO NOT RELY ON SPELL-CHECK.  I'm fond of beginning a sentence with the rhetorical use of \"Perhaps\", but on page 116 Professor Yagoda rules against \"perhaps\" in favor of \"maybe,\" because \"Lengthy is [not] desirable; short is good.\"<br /><br />O.k. (he doesn't discuss OK), so if the shorter word is better, why's he using \"cogitation\" instead of \"thought\" in the run-on sentence on page 135: \"Usually, a writer uses a word twice because no alternative is self-evident or, sometimes, conceivable after what seems like a lengthy period of cogitation.\"<br /><br />Professor Yagoda instructs us not to employ . . . uh . . . tells us not to use clich&eacute;s, but on page 84, he uses both \"gets a clean bill of health\" and \"for all intents and purposes.\"  I can forgive the first because it sounds quaint (just what is a \"clean bill of health\" anyway? Obamacare?), but \"for all intents and purposes\" is nothing more than stock filler. Kids are mocked for littering sentences with \"like\" or \"y'know,\" but \"for all intents and purposes\" gets a clean bill of health, because it seems, like, sophisticated.<br /><br />He repeatedly cautions against using redundancies, but on page 128, he writes, \" . . . different people will have different notions on where a particular phrase lies at a particular point in time.\" The ghastly redundancy \"at this point in time\" sprouted like a wart (in Washington, as does most damage to the language) during the Watergate hearings, and I thought it went out with H. R. Haldeman, but apparently it still sounds highly elegant to the ears of Professor Yagoda.<br /><br />Throughout the book, he speaks of the importance of having a good ear for what constitutes good writing, and this is true. It also illustrates why such cardinal rules as putting the comma to the left of the quotation marks and the semicolon to the right are, in reality, trivial and silly compared with the writer's ability to communicate or report in an unambiguous and entertaining manner.<br /><br />Alas, by about page ten it becomes obvious that Professor Yagoda has a tin ear. How else can you explain his correcting a perfectly good sentence with this result: \"In a flurry we grabbed some plastic containers filled with sprouts and kimchi. The damages were $12.75.\"<br /><br />\"The damages were . . .\"?  That's something my late father would think was clever. (He also was fond of saying, \"Everything's copacetic.\")  On page 11 we find, \"I have scrawled it many times: comma splices, like the dude in [[ASIN:B00181JGI2 The Big Lebowski]], abide.\" (I added the link in case you are not familiar with >The Dude.&lt;)  What is the purpose of joining the two sentences with a colon, thus creating ambiguity as to what he scrawled?<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, and despite that he doesn't discuss the more arcane details of possessives and other baffling aspects which make English the most miserable language in the galaxy, the book does contain some useful suggestions. The section about unnecessary commas was an eye opener, and I realized that I had been making that mistake as well as several others. One's writing can always be improved, and I give the book a tentative recommendation for that reason. But because of the fatal lack of an index, the book is of little help for the person who is stuck in mid-sentence and is reaching for a handy guide to provide a quick solution. For that I recommend [[ASIN:1594488908 Woe Is I]] by Patricia T. O'Conner.

No such luck. This is really a gossip sheet and is very amateurish at best.

There is no real analysis of what the author finds during his efforts to locate Cooper or what the significance of his findings really are.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Okay if you have a few hours to kill", "text": "Death Unmasked<br />By: Rick Sulik<br /><br />Detective Sean Jamison, months\u2014maybe weeks\u2014away from retirement from the Houston Police Dept., suddenly realizes he\u2019s lived before, perhaps many times. While he works toward solving what he hopes will be his last case in THIS life (a serial killer murdering women in Houston), he\u2019s also looking for the love of his LAST life, a woman raped and killed by a Nazi officer.<br /><br />It\u2019s confusing; I know. Yet, the idea of reincarnation mixed with a modern-day murder mystery was intriguing to me. So, I bought the book.<br />First, let me tell you what I liked most about it:<br /><br />(1) Mr. Sulik\u2019s story is very imaginative and unique. It is basically a cop/killer mystery with an added twist of re-incarnated lovers finding one another in this life after tragically losing each other in a past life. The story is both horrifying and frightening AND romantic and sweet all at the same time. I\u2019ve never read anything like it.<br /><br />(2) Mr. Sulik DOES have talent. When he paints the pictures of the WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY and HOW details of the story they are sharply and artistically drawn.<br /><br />(3) Most of Mr. Sulik\u2019s characters (Det. Jamison and his co-workers for example) are honorable, witty and likeable.<br /><br />Now, let me tell you what I had trouble with:<br /><br />(1) On his way to work one morning, Det. Jamison suffers a blinding headache, pulls over to the side of the road, almost passes out and then\u2014OUT OF THE BLUE\u2014suddenly realizes he has been reincarnated. Not only that, he also instantly becomes aware that his lady love from his last life has also been reincarnated AND lives somewhere in his same city of Houston. He must find her at all cost.<br />a. Uh\u2026 huh? Do those kinds of realizations always hit a person so suddenly and so completely, so cleanly without warning? Without a psychic reading? Without a magician\u2019s hypnosis act gone wrong? Something\u2026<br /><br />I don\u2019t mean to sound so sarcastic. Truly. I just found the suddenness of the revelation\u2014and the fully realized history of it\u2014to be a little\u2026unbelievable.<br /><br />(2) I also had trouble with Mr. Sulik\u2019s writing style when it came to conversations between characters. Their speech was always stilted, unnatural and the rhythm was all wrong. No one speaks the way these characters do. Words, phrases\u2026they either didn\u2019t fit the situation, the character or the time. Occasionally these Houston TEXAS detectives sounded more like Brooklyn beat cops, Boston gang members or Montagues and Capulets.  NONE of the conversations seemed realistic to me. Every time I came across a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate I was pulled so thoroughly from the story that I had to force myself to continue.<br /><br />(3) There is a smaller side story in which one of the lesser characters falls in love with another in an afternoon after knowing this man for years. She falls so completely and so hard\u2026 and so quickly\u2026well, it was just so implausible. And, in my own humble opinion, it was an unnecessary \u201ctwist\u201d. It really served no purpose.<br /><br />(4) Lastly, in the last few chapters of the book, the story becomes very \u2026convoluted and just plain odd. Not only is Jamison re-incarnated along with his past-life mate and one or two others; one of the other detectives suddenly begins remote-viewing the killer and no one is surprised or taken aback in any way. Another detective suddenly realizes he knows the whole recent and past-life history of the killer\u2014because of course, he too is paranormal. It just goes on and on\u2026<br /><br />Suddenly, toward the end of the book, DEATH UNMASKED becomes an un-authorized episode of X-Files\u2014on Steroids! It\u2019s just SO much, SO fast, SO\u2026weird.<br /><br />The wrap up is so complicated and long-winded that it\u2019s entirely unsatisfying and maddening.<br /><br />Here\u2019s where it becomes complicated for me: As I was telling my husband all about this book over the breakfast table this morning I found myself defending it when he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you finished it. I would have just closed it and never picked it up again.\u201d<br />\u201cBut, I kind of liked it!\u201d I cried. That\u2019s when I realized, right out of the blue (yes, I get the irony) that it wasn\u2019t a bad book and I did indeed like some of it. I just think Mr. Sulik needs to work on his conversational writing skill. And, unfortunately, I think he went off the rails a little bit toward the end.<br /><br />BUT\u2026it\u2019s a book with a great plot and a unique twist. I kind of liked it. Other readers may love it.<br /><br />Just know going in that it is a book with issues.", "images": [], "asin": "1938985834", "parent_asin": "1938985834", "user_id": "AHUALHQGIUD6HTNZD5AUQK5UTZOQ", "timestamp": 1487882489000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 5}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Decent sequel", "text": "I feel a certain loyalty to Harriet, since the original Harriet the Spy was one of my favorite books as a kid. I had my doubts about the two sequels, each written by different authors after Louis Fitzhugh's too-soon death, but both did a fairly good job of staying true to the spirit of Harriet.<br /><br />Harriet the Spy Double Agent, is a bit better than Harriet spies Again, because Harriet is more her old note-taking self and spends more time talking to Sport, who himself is going through his own turmoil what with his dad's new wife, being in love, and sprouting a few facial hairs. Double Agent also hints (maybe as a tribute to Fitzhugh?) at Harriet's budding sexuality as she discovers and ruminates about her own feelings about Sport, Ole Golly, and her new intriguing friend and spy partner, Annie Smith, who has created three names and personalities for herself and has a few secrets of her own.<br /><br />Harriet Spies Again (which comes before Double Agent, if you want to read them in order) feels a little empty, as there is very little spying, note taking or interaction with Harriet's friends, and the whole Ole Golly reunion falls kind of flat. Also, it may have been less obvious what was going on with Ole Golly to a younger reader, but to me it was pretty predictable.<br /><br />Missing from both books is Fitzhugh's wry wit, but these sequels are worth a read if, as a now-grown adult fan, you can ignore that feeling that you're visiting a ghost.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Bad Karma", "text": "Warning Book Spoiler below<br /><br />It's obvious this author cares only about cranking out a book and not about the quality of the book.  This book was terrible.  It is true, however, that U.S. citizens have been going to India for the last 10 years for needed medical surgeries AND for cosmetic surgeries because of high USA medical costs and in the future under ObamaCare, India, South Africa (big cosmetic surgery country) and several other countries will take the USA medical industry just as other countries already took the USA's auto/TV/everything manufactured industry.  Under Obama, even the USA space program is gone - went to Russia and China.<br /><br />There is ONE sentence in the whole book that describes India. page 424  Jennifer and Veena are in a VERY BAD slum area and see infants, toddlers, etc. living in total squalor, rickety and impermanent shelters.  Jennifer asks Veen \"When you see this, doesn't it make you sad?\".  Veena answers\" No.  It's their karma.\"<br /><br />Veena CONDONES the India caste system (per-determined by birth status in society) and disdainfully dismisses these \"lower class\" people forced to live in wretched poverty with ZERO hope of becoming anything better because if a family cleans sewers or whatever NO ONE WILL EVER hire them to do anything else.  Yet, Veena wants to migrate to the USA where she can spread her caste crap.<br /><br />Maybe it was a different type of karma that punished Veena by having her be raped by her father for years.  I hope karma further punishes her by denying her a USA visa and she rots in hell for killing Jennifer's grandmother and gets her nursing license pulled so she can live in squalor.<br /><br />Note:  It is unrealistic that Jennifer would forgive Veena for killing her grandmother.  It wouldn't be fair to the grandmother if Veena did NOT go to jail and what about the other nurses who killed other patients in the exact same way.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The Wrong Reich", "text": "You ever have one of those crazy bosses?<br /><br />She would blast ecological sounds so loudly we had to ask her to turn it down (our jobs included listening to actors read lines). Another time, she called in sick because she was \"wafting vapors.\" She always brought up her education in conversation.  She never seemed to actually do any work, but instead worked on her novel, using company resources to write it.  And she was strangely preoccupied with \"ganja\" to the point that she used it as her password, a fact she was only too happy to share. \"Wafting vapors\" indeed.<br /><br />After I finished reading Nickel and Dimed, I was convinced Ehrenreich was my former boss. A highly-educated journalist with an arch tone, she blesses us all with her insights by going undercover as a poor person and trying to get by.  Which is a bit like the scene from Aladdin when the princess slips out into the real world.<br /><br />You see, Ehrenreich wants to help people.  She really does, and she views things in a sort of black and white, my way or the highway sort of charitable aggressiveness.  She's an ideological bully, the kind that is impossible to argue with because she cloaks herself with the cause of the underdog.<br /><br />And that's a shame, because Ehrenreich's absolutely right in what she uncovers: that the poor can't get by on minimum wage salaries in the year 2000. The only way to survive is to have a partner, she concludes, but with that comes the baggage of living with another person, possibly children, and all that entails.  And yet, Ehrenreich's experiment lacks precisely that - when she is given the opportunity o move in with a friend, she turns it down.<br /><br />Ehrenreich isn't a poor person.  In fact, she is so NOT poor that she secretly feels she should be treated differently because she's better educated, or because she's a journalist, or because she's trying to help people when clearly bosses are greedy and poor people are too weak to fend for themselves.<br /><br />In my first job, I worked in a factory.  I've come a long way from that factory job, but it taught me a lot as a high school student.  And what's missing most from Ehrenreich's tour in Poor People Land is that these people aren't characters in her book; they're real people.  Ehrenreich never seems to detach herself from her upbringing, although she would have us believe otherwise.  The signs, if you read carefully, are there.<br /><br />The one that really turned me off was the fact that Ehrenreich, due to an \"indiscretion,\" smokes pot when she knows she'll be going on job interviews.  Now either Ehrenreich didn't know job interviews required drug testing, which speaks poorly to her journalistic abilities, or she has a fondness for pot she fails to disclose as part of who she is.  From there it's railing against the system of drug testing, a charge that becomes shrill when she beats the test and sees that as further evidence that drug testing is dumb. There are lots of hard working poor folks who aren't smoking pot before job interviews, and Ehrenreich isn't doing the underrepresented poor any favors by succumbing to the stereotype.<br /><br />The other hypocrisy is that Ehrenreich bristles at psychological tests.  I agree with her, I hated those tests too.  She objects to the tone of the questions and their underlying agenda, but the back of the book contains a \"reader's guide\" that asks such loaded questions as, \"have you ever been homeless, unemployed, without health insurance, or held down two jobs?  What is the lowest-paying job you ever held and what kind of help--if any--did you need to improve your situation?\" The lack of self-awareness rife throughout the book is breathtaking.<br /><br />The final indignity is when Ehrenreich, the educated white woman who knows better, decides on a lark to start a union at Wal-Mart.  Heedless of what the consequences might be, she just skips right out of that final job into her conclusions.  Never mind that Ehrenreich was intentionally rabble-rousing workers who, if they had decided to try to form a union, could have all lost their jobs.  And where would that leave them, while Ehrenreich went back to her comfortable house?<br /><br />But if you can look past that, and I'm sure a lot of people can't, the book's messages are sound.  The end result of a capitalist system in America is ultimately hostile to itself.  The rich need the poor to work as cheaply and inexpensively as possible, and this form of human labor market ultimately degrades the bottom ranks until they rebel. Ehrenreich doesn't have any answers as to why the poor haven't rebelled already and instead concludes with navel-gazing reader's guide.<br /><br />Nickel and Dimed should be required reading for CEOs everywhere who are often responsible for the fates of thousands of peoples' livelihoods.  I just wish Ehrenreich hadn't written it.", "images": [], "asin": "0805088385", "parent_asin": "0805088385", "user_id": "AFGDOWXYBXW46W56NEVSOPWFKLWA", "timestamp": 1218918403000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Decent enough, but a little too overly long for its plot", "text": "This is kind of an odd book to review. It's such a strange read in that it kind of likes to play with your mind as you're reading, to the point where you kind of have to re-read a page or two just to make sure that what you've read is what happened. However at the same time it just seems like Nevill tried a little too hard to trump the oddness and strangeness he's inserted into his earlier works.<br /><br />There are some great scenes in this book and at times you'll find it difficult to put this book down because you'll be that desperate to know what the great mystery is and what exactly will happen to all of the various people in this book. Our lead character of Catherine is sort of wishy washy, which both helps and hurts the book at points. It does help explain why she'd be so willing to put up with the ridiculousness she does, but at the same time it kind of makes you shake your head at what she does put up with in order to complete the job. At times she's just so passive that you just want for the Big Bad to happen already because she just doesn't seem to have that much fight in her to last the rest of the book.<br /><br />That brings me to the biggest flaw of the book: it's just too long. It's just under 400 pages, but the story here almost felt like it could have been told in about 250-300 pages. Too much time is spent hinting at the mysteries and exploring the house, so that I was a little underwhelmed when the book did start moving towards its climax. There are some great scenes, but drawing them out gives the reader plenty of time to see where things are going- especially if they've read some of Nevill's previous works.<br /><br />Still, there's enough here to entertain us fans of his work and to continue to draw in new fans. It's not his best work- I'd say that Last Days is my favorite of his works so far- but it's still pretty entertaining for the most part. I'd probably just recommend this as a library read for most people that are curious about this work.", "images": [], "asin": "B00HP1JYRW", "parent_asin": "B00HP1JYRW", "user_id": "AFAAY32MQYRA56IVSVNSCDLNE62A", "timestamp": 1416412795000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

This being so, when I have extensively read the Qur'an and hadith sources on the topic, so I was familiar with the content.  Yet, I still learned additional cures for the evil eye, which was new knowledge for me.<br /><br />This is the third book I have read on the Jinns-which included a self-published one-and this came out on top.  It skims over topics, but covers the essentials, which is sufficient for the layman.  The belief of the author is sound and solid, and it is evident from his writings.  His book is extremely beneficial for a majority of Muslims-including the well educated ones-who are easily led astray when faced with this subject.  Many a Muslim is tricked by charlatans, who exploit the lack of sound faith and religious knowledge in the victims.  The author has put things in the right perspective.  My prior readings corroborate his statements.<br /><br />The book however, has 3 major shortcomings:<br />1.  There is a dire need for professional editing, from an experienced American editor.  There are too many repetitions, and the grammar needs polishing.  Darusalam distributes internationally, and its high time they learn and adopt international standards.<br /><br />2. The book lacks citations in about 30-40% of the content.  No statement, name, claim or phenomenon can be printed without a citation.  Refer to point #1.<br /><br />3.  There are a few weak hadith referenced here. This makes one question the author's sources of research.  In the presence of the sihah sitta, the massive body of reliable hadith, it should be the sole source of a Muslim scholar.  One who quotes weak hadith raises questions about his work.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A superb story premise, but it muddles and fizzles quickly", "text": "I showed the publisher's description of this mystery-adventure novel to my wife just after I ordered this book and she said, \"That sounds like a really great one.\" I had harbored precisely the same thought so I was fully prepared to burn the midnight oil on this title. Unfortunately, my expectations did not come to fruition.<br /><br />I'm going to give somewhat lengthy details of my critique because, if the author (Katherine Neville) happens across my mediocre rating of her book, she is entitled to hear EXACTLY WHY I did not care much for the work. Unfortunately, others might find this approach to be a little excessive but I take book reviews quite seriously (especially critical ones) and just saying, \"I didn't like this book,\" would be entirely unfair to the author who worked so hard on it.<br /><br />First, here's the story in a nutshell which I will convey with an eye to coherence rather than to just regurgitate the tale in the order in which it is yielded up by the author:<br /><br />The chief heroine/protagonist, Alexandra Solarin, works in an exclusive Washington D.C. Basque specialty restaurant where she is being trained by the owner in the perfectionist art of preparing fine ethnic cuisine. Then she gets a strange invitation to attend her mother's birthday party at her mom's isolated Colorado home.<br /><br />The mystery centers chiefly upon the pieces and playing board of an infamous chess set which is called The Montglane Service. This chess theme links to Alexandra in that she happens to be a chess genius and was well on the way to becoming a Master when her father who was accompanying her to a match in Russia was shot by an assassin.<br /><br />In any event, the chess set of focus was devised in Baghdad by Islamic alchemist al-Jabir ibn Hayan in 765 C.E for the Caliph al-Mansur and was actually an encoded device for housing the mysteries of... well, what would be the most precious thing to any mortal human? And I'll leave the answer there. Perhaps a revealing excerpt from early in the story would also be expeditious here:<br /><br />\"...the secret of the marvelous chess set. It was a formula which, if solved, could do far more than create or destroy civilizations. It could transform both energy and matter and much, much else,\" (page 94).<br /><br />In fact, there are numerous retrospectives between Hayan's day and 2003 (and at many chronological stops in between) which describe the happenings with the various chess pieces and the people who have been charged with their eternal safety and security, many of these folks losing their lives in the process. And who all is involved in this tangle? To name just a few: Charlemagne; Percy Shelly; Napoleon's mother; Tsar Alexander I; The U.S. Secret Service (sort of); The KGB; Talleyrand of France; The Piscataway Indians; Thoth of Egypt (obliquely); numerous ancient rulers and religious figures; and, many, many more. Sound confusing? It is. I began to think that Neville forgot to toss in Elvis and it was at about that point in the text that he popped up too!<br /><br />The difficulties with this book are more general than they are specific. In the interest of clarity, I'll enumerate them:<br /><br />1. This book has no core... no soul. I couldn't latch on to any of the principals and empathize with them for the literary ride. There are just way too many famous people and a similar number of exotic locations, all too excessive to make the story believable.<br /><br />2. The endless pieces of this puzzle are not limited to the attempted theme of the Montglane [Chess] Service, the object which sets the stage for a mystery which is multi-dimensional a. in international settings, b. in time (from 765 C.E. to present day), and, c. in varying religious faiths as well. At just about the time that one believes that he or she has caught up with all the clues and dates, the author bombards us with yet another set of people, places, and times and after a few cycles of this, \"the kitchen sink\" comes to mind.<br /><br />3. Alexandra and a number of her family members, peers, and associates are into interpreting codes and ciphers. Honestly, I found this aspect of the text to reek of juvenilia. At first I thought it to be a joke but after the fourth or fifth inanely written puzzle, in an adventure which purportedly takes itself seriously, I found it to be incongruous. While such caveats might have been appropriate in a tongue-and-cheek action thriller, perhaps in [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]] where there are some intentional moments of levity, these inconsistent brain-teasers took away from the seriousness of this particular story.<br /><br />4. I never achieved a good mental vision of the characters in this book, Leda being the lone exception, (her description is quite nicely-rendered on page 149) -- this was a missed opportunity. While the principals' relationships to one another were fairly clear, (at least within the parameters of each chronological period), the general lack of character wallpaper generated an overall void which could have been so easily filled but wasn't.<br /><br />5. At the outset of each chapter the author has inserted a quotation or two which purportedly punctuates the theme or object of the upcoming segment of text. This technique has, quite unfortunately, become much hackneyed and its employment in the face of this fact is quite unimaginative; when the practice is not used shrewdly and sparingly, the aggregate of the quotes simply begin to manifest as literary debris which is the case in this instance. To make matters even worse, one of these quotations, found on page 248, conveyed a tidbit by hedonist, astrologer, drug addict, and illuminist, Aleister Crowley, (1875-1947) a non-credible scoundrel of the First Water who was dubbed by the tabloid press of his day as `The Wickedest Man in the World,' and who claimed, among other titles, that of `Magus'. Even the readings at Crowley's cremation service (his own writings) were referred to in the press as 'A Black Mass,' an actuality which would have pleased the heinous mystic and alchemist on the highest level. Now, had the author also supplemented her book exclusively with quotations from people with like reputations and personalities such as Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, Osama bin Laden, Reverend Jim Jones, and so on, I would have found Crowley's entry to be appropriate and not at all offensive. But her other quotations were chiefly from credible folks such as Alexander Dumas, W.B. Yeats, Charles Dickens and obliquely, the quotations come off (inadvertently, I'm sure) as if she were placing these other reputably notable people all in the same fraternity with Crowley. Somewhat in Neville's defense, Crowley's words were clearly employed resultant of his connections with the game of chess and with his extensive knowledge of codes and cyphers. But, to finalize this thought, I just felt that tossing the likes of Crowley in with Dumas and Company was an inattentive oversight and a mistake which should have been resisted. Perhaps this seems a small point but it is representative of gaffes which I seemed to encounter throughout the text.<br /><br />6. I love books which insert a food/cooking interest. This one plugs into that appeal but we are hung out with no resolution at these opportune culinary moments. Alexandra speaks of the delectability of her Uncle's pancakes, among other items, but we're left to our own devices to ascertain WHY they were so great. We are given no secret ingredients, nor are the Uncle's special techniques revealed. Food is described throughout the book in complimentary terms and, fancying myself as an amateur chef, I really desired to latch on to this sub-interest... but I felt DEPRIVED to say the least! Even if the secret techniques would not work in actuality, as long as they had sounded plausible I would have been much gratified. I just wish that the author had developed this notion, having brought it in to begin with.<br /><br />7. The technical errors, though not legion, are still of an individual magnitude as to really spoil this tale, even if everything else had been okay. In fact, someday, I am going to get rich by inventing the \"novel writer's revolver\" which features an UNNECESSARY safety and which, by its existence will bail book authors out of a mess which I once thought would eventually cease to occur in the literary world - but again, it has sadly popped up here. On page 425, one of the book's evil characters clicks the safety to the off position on a small pearl-handled revolver! This is an amateurish mistake and should NEVER happen. I emitted a great sigh of annoyance when it did. In an earlier part of the book, (page 148), Alexandra shuts down the burglar alarm in the restaurant where she works and when she ingresses the building, her friend, Leda, is already there. Does Leda's body mass somehow not set off burglar alarms? Again, these types of obvious errors in a book that is supposedly professionally published drag down the story. Another glitch I'm pretty well assured of caught my attention here. There is a reference to the \"famous gingko bilbao trees\" on page 275. Gingko Bilbao (I'm pretty certain on this) is the DRUG BRAND NAME for a non-pharmaceutical herbal curative which addresses men's weakening libido. The TREE from which it is extracted is actually the \"Ginkgo\" and for which the scientific name is \"Ginkgo biloba\" (so-called for its two-lobed leaves -- note the differences in the spelling of both words) So what this tells me is the publisher's fact-checker found it expedient to just track down the name of the herb extract, and not the tree itself. Perhaps the author had the Basque city of Bilbao, Spain in mind from her researching. I don't know but it was a sad hoot when I read that. Finally, there was a piece of dialogue (page 276) where one of the principals says, \"Your Flat?\" he snorted. \"A campground has more amenities.\" I'm sorry but today's campgrounds (some specialty ones are also called RV Parks) are quite up to date in terms of technology and luxury, many offering everything from internet connections to Jacuzzis to one-stop shopping in the camp store. I got the feeling that the author had not \"camped\" in the past 30 years. I'm not discussing typos with all these items -- these are errors of fact, sloppy work on someone's part.<br /><br />Now, I wish to emphasize that this book is NOT a piece of trash... I don't at all want to leave prospective readers with totally negative impressions here. In fact I believe that this book could be improved 100 percent given some high-quality editing and a little additional character development - the work holds every potential of rising to five stars. From my view, I hold the editor to be at least equally responsible as the author in this work's shortcomings, whatever they might be. Clearly, there will be people who will breeze through the book as it stands and they will enjoy it. It's just that, having read a number of works which embrace similarities of theme and literary profile, in addition to the hundreds of non-paralleling novels that I've read and many of which having struck me as terrific, that this one just did not make the grade.<br /><br />Probably the best compliment that I can pay this novel is that it stands on its own even though it is, in fact, a sequel to a work which the author published 20 years ago. I didn't read that earlier entry ([[ASIN:0345419081 The Eight]]) but Katherine Neville did effect a fine job of making this book \"whole\" in that it's unnecessary to read the prequel to understand this later book. I should also say that I can appreciate the research that Neville must have performed in order to attempt to make the text as real as possible. This is a much more difficult task than simply writing a book solely from the knowledge which one accumulates over the years, penning a novel from that typically common, everyday information. And finally, the account is uniquely rendered in first person for the contemporary periods and in third person for the retrospectives - I've never encountered this before so perhaps this breaks some new ground in that realm, or at least it did for me. It's a well-established fact that writing a novel in first person is typically a challenge for even the best of authors.<br /><br />However, this work does not break new ground as far as the particular theme goes - various aspects of the instant work have previously been explored in such books as \"The Celestine Prophecy, (James Redfield); \"The List of Seven,\" (Mark Frost); \"Gospel,\" (Wilton Barnhardt); \"River God,\" (Wilbur A. Smith); and in various Clive Cussler titles. In fact I would point out that, in addition to the previous contemporary titles and authors, there are two superb, older works which hold similarities of premise and/or in thematic approach: [[ASIN:0395957753 The Robe]] and, [[ASIN:0375757856 The Moonstone (Modern Library Classics)]], each of which were as solid and coherent as this one is perplexing and vague.<br /><br />In summary, my expectations for this book had been pretty high in the beginning, having read the publisher's description but at the end, I finished the story only with considerable difficulty, chiefly embracing the distracting thought that the next book on my \"to read\" shelf would make up ground for this one. This novel is 435 pages in length and I found it neither compelling nor dynamic. It's just way too over-dramatized with too many tenuous (or non-existent) links. I also didn't care one bit for the bling-bling approach of \"Lily's Gramp\" going down in the North Tower of the World Trade Center on 9-11-01 as she was to meet him for an appointment. That idea has already been over-used and I found it as tasteless this time as I did in the very first instance that I encountered it.<br /><br />I gave this book three stars instead of two as a consequence of my personal fever for historical fiction.

From the gimmicky chapter numbering which jumps all over the place, to the chapters consisting of a single page picture, there\u2019s no timeline to grab onto, and I often felt myself scrambling to figure out exactly when things were happening. I found myself needing to keep a running summary of each chapter as I read. To me, this is work; not the enjoyment I expect from a book. I felt that the summary left much to be wanted in describing this book.<br /><br />The book got off to very slow start. It took me three days to read the first 30 pages. After that point, things picked up and the book finally developed a rhythm I could get into. Still, I could never relax into this book because of how the timeline, or lack thereof, jumped around.<br /><br />This book has many, many triggers for those who are sensitive.  Here they are, if you're interested:<br />child abandonment, cancer, murder, drug use, death, snakes, rape, sadistic behavior<br /><br />The book is dark and haunting. The characters are interesting, but I never felt that they were fully fleshed out. It seemed like the author had the desire to try to shock the reader in every way possible, but often without any real payoff for the reader.<br /><br />The writing itself is quite good, at times almost poetic. Unfortunately, I think the book could have been much shorter. The author enjoyed showing all the lurid and horrible at the expense of character development and story pace. For instance, the chapters with Alvero and Flaca could have been cut in half, or even to a quarter of the length in this final version. It\u2019s point is to show Alvero\u2019s oddities and how they affected Penny, but I didn\u2019t feel that it really worked all that well. It involved snakes, and I\u2019m no fan of them, so that may have some influence on my opinion.<br /><br />I did like Penny and Cale and some of the other characters, but not enough to really care what happens to them. I guess that was good because I didn\u2019t come away feeling that I knew what happened to them. Too much was left unexplained.<br /><br />I can\u2019t say that this book is a favorite read of mine. It isn\u2019t. I think it could have been, if the author hadn\u2019t worked so hard to make it such a difficult, disagreeable read. To make it worse, I didn\u2019t feel rewarded for all of my hard work in the end. It wasn\u2019t a very satisfying conclusion in my eyes and left several threads flailing in the wind.<br /><br />I doubt I\u2019ll be recommending this book to anyone. It\u2019s certainly not a book I intend to keep or read again. I found it very disappointing. It definitely wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, and I doubt I\u2019ll be looking for other books by this author.<br /><br />I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway.

There is no clear moral to the story (if anything, laziness is rewarded). The majority of the story is the ants in the anthill speculating about what has become of Juan Hormiga (the title character). There is a lot of dialogue, all written in red text rather than the black of the narration. Younger readers will find the dialogue difficult to follow, as it doesn't differentiate between the characters speaking very clearly. The illustrations are done in a minimalist cartoon style.

He gets into the grime and muck of their motivations, their hopes and dreams, and gets you to root for them regardless of how despicable they might be.<br /><br />As a return after more than five years away from BT novels, Stackpole delivers an off-main arc story in this one. While it does not really serve as a good introductory novel to the BT universe, for those versed in the details and history it is exceptional.<br /><br />Focusing primarily on two main characters, a Wolf-in-Exile castoff named Verena who manages to achieve fame and rank through accident rather than design, and Alaric Wolf, a Clan Wolf Star colonel who considers himself a god amongst mortals destined to rule over all he surveys. Alaric happens to be the son of Katherine Steiner-Davion (known still as Katrina) and her brother, Victor, through some Clan genetic milkshake process.<br /><br />Through various machinations, the Wolf Clan chooses to relocate their entire nation and peoples from the occupation zone they carved into the Inner Sphere 80 years earlier (see Stackpole's Blood of Kerensky series) by cooperating with their wayward cousins, the Wolves-in-Exile, and the Lyran Commonwealth. To prevent their enemies from taking advantage of their move, Alaric lights upon a plan to distract them by announcing (and supposedly pursuing) the conquest of Terra, the long-ago goal of the Clan Invasion.<br /><br />In their feinted drive toward Terra, Alaric takes a planet and strips it of useful materiel. When another main character, Anastasia Kerensky of the Wolf Hunters merc unit arrives, his arrogance and presumption result in his capture. He learns a great deal about her and himself during the treatment he receives at her hands. He also meets Verena after her fame has catapulted her to heights she never expected, commanding a battalion of 'Mechs in defense of the region the Wolves are invading.<br /><br />Through her own obvious devious machinations, Anastasia returns Alaric to Clan Wolf, where he is tasked with commanding another planetary invasion that pits him against Verena.<br /><br />The end of the book clearly leaves a lot unresolved, something that never pleases me overmuch. Each book should stand alone, but since this is one book of many in a shared universe, threads have to be left hanging. While there is some resolution for parts of the characters' tales, the scale of the story is bigger than could be resolved in under 300 pages. Given that Stackpole's recent fare has topped 400 pages, this was little more than an appetizer for those who might collect the author's works.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Good For One Isn't Necessaril Good For All", "text": "I found this book to have a self important tone as the author seems to feel that because quitting poker was the right thing for him, it is the right thing for everyone.  The fact is we are all different and the right thing for one person isn't the right thing for someone else.  I like playing poker and it brings me enjoyment, but I won't say everyone should play.<br /><br />The book might have made a better case if the author was a highly successful player who walked away, but that's not what the player was.  It would also have been better if the author had a better self view of his &#34;success&#34;.  He thinks having made $2500 over seventeen months playing microstakes online means he was a successful player.  He was, if he is to be believed, a winning player, but does netting an average of about $147 a month make someone a successful player?  I don't think so.<br /><br />The author also doesn't have an accurate view of how his job ended at a second start-up.  At one point, he says he was fired, but then when he talks about what caused his [life] tilt, he says he quit.  You can't quit a job you were fired from and you can't be fired from a job you quit.<br /><br />As the author isn't a native English speaker, there are still a lot of grammatical &#34;errors&#34; in this third edition, but the book is fairly readable.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a sobering look at why microstakes poker wasn't right for the author.", "images": [], "asin": "1495282236", "parent_asin": "1495282236", "user_id": "AFF6DXJBTJW4NEN7DQRJLY2QIQXQ", "timestamp": 1499637080464, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

The second is: \"The Legend of the Slain Soldiers\" and the third and final is \"Beyond the Grave\" (co-authored with Bill Pronzini who is now Muller's husband).  Actually, I think this trilogy gets better book by book, so I actually liked this one the least of the 3.  But, it's interesting to see Muller write of protagonists other than Sharon McCone--demonstrates her breadth of talent.  She also authored the Joanna Stark trilogy about an art security expert.  This series is heavily into the world of Hispanic art but is heavily dosed with the personalities of its highly divergent characters--highlighting human foibles.  It is not a continuing saga like the Stark trilogy, but is connected in time and in the characters involved.  Interestingly, Muller gives Elena a cameo appearance in her latest Sharon McCone adventure: \"The Dangerous Hour.\"  I find Elena to be a very appealing character and admire Muller for delving into a somewhat different world for this trilogy; it's worth reading the entire trilogy.

This is one of her lesser efforts that only make the rest of her work so much better.<br />The story is cleverly arranged into &quot;Acts&quot;, a reflection of the main character, Sir Charles Cartwright, a famous stage actor who is now retired.  Sir Charles hosts a dinner party which includes many who have connections with the stage:  Angela Sutcliffe, actress; Miss Willis, playwright; Capt. Darce and his wife, who run a theatrical dressmaking business; and Mr. Satterthwaite, wealthy patron of the arts (featured in the short story collection THE MYSTERIOUS MR. QUIN).  Rounding out the party are  Dr. Strange, a specialist in nervous disorder and a college friend; the local vicar and his wife; Lady Mary Lytton Gore and her daughter Hermione, Mr. Oliver Manders and Hercule Poirot.<br />The party proceeds predictably until a murder takes place (or maybe just proceeds predictably).  End of Act I, Act II weeks later another dinner party takes place miles aways, many, although not all, of the same guests are present and another murder takes place.  Act III, Poirot and others involved in the tragedies investigate the crimes and of course, Poirot solves the crime.<br />The characters of Mr. Satterthwaite and Hermione are delightful and well written and Poirot is his usual eccentric self.  Unfortunately the rest of the characters are  down right boring and totally forgetable. The plot itself is far better than the characters.  The crimes are cleverly done, there is the usual Christie twist at the end but even that cannot raise this beyond a passable rating.

I put off doing this review for a couple of months because I was so disgusted with this book.

I was expecting an unbiased evaluation of health care reform with a perspective from a doctor on what's best all-around, for us as patients and as Americans.  Instead, I got an extremely leftist, super-liberal book that is so obviously NOT an unbiased perspective from a doctor who is \"in the trenches,\" that I had to force myself to even finish it.  (which I did, because I wanted to give it a really fair opportunity to change the impression I got from the first few chapters of it).<br /><br />Since reading this book, I have paid more attention to Howard Dean and his opinions in the news, and I find him extreme and really over-the-edge.  I won't go any further into my own political feelings here, but as a reviewer I want you to realize before purchasing that if you are buying this book you should know ahead of time that it is written as a politician and left-winger first, and a doctor second (or third or fourth or whatever).<br /><br />So if you lean left, you'll love it.

{"rating": 2, "title": "A convoluted mess", "text": "The Ruin of Kings has been on my radar ever since it was announced in 2018 being compared to Joe Abercrombie (one of my favorite authors), Patrick Rothfuss, and Brandon Sanderson. It sounded so good - a heavy dose of epic fantasy with all the usual nastiness and morally-grey characters. But I could not connect with a single character or event in this book no matter what I did. The convoluted storytelling DID NOT HELP. In Fact I skimmed the last half of this as fast as I could....<br /><br />I'm sure the right sort of reader will eat this up and add it to their favorites list. It does seem to be garnering a lot of positive attention. At least the publisher is making it seem like that with those heavy words \"Prepare to meet the genre's next star.\"<br /><br />Page 1 begins with an ominous scene. We\u2019re introduced to a boy named Kirian as he is in a jail cell with a \u201cdemon\u201d named Talon who is leaning on the outside bars begging for a story to be told on how he got there.<br /><br />And so he begins.<br /><br />And so does she.<br /><br />That\u2019s right. We are forced to follow not one but two different perspectives of the same story being told. We have two narrations here! There\u2019s Kihrins 1st person perspective talking about his recent events and then there\u2019s Talons 3rd person perspective talking about what happened before the events he\u2019s telling.. uhhhh. So yes, Talons chapters aren't about her. They're also about Kihrin.. in 3rd person.. but his name is Rook..<br /><br />Which would have been incredibly unique and interesting but I found it to be confusing and hard to follow. OH YEAH! There\u2019s also footnotes throughout the whole book...<br /><br />Not like I don\u2019t enjoy a complex story, I freaking do! Like give me all the complexity! But with the writing style, body swapping (where characters are actually not the characters you think they are) and the 10 page glossary in the back of the book of smash-your-face-on-keyboard names (including multiple nicknames for multiple characters) made up slangs for gangs, and kingdoms and faraway lands. This quickly became a chore. Adding insult to injury, I found the the main character Kihrin very unlikeable and did not enjoy reading the story he wanted to tell.<br /><br />I think if we had a linear plot line, it would have been much more enjoyable. It's so frustrating that its convoluted because there is a wonderful story and world that's sort of obstructed by the time and perspective jumps. The world building is beautiful and the rich history/cultures were *insert grabby hands*<br /><br />But all in all, I am left in a puddle of disappointment.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Bottom of the charts", "text": "What happened to David Mitchell since his Cloud Atlas masterpiece, his Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet stunner, and even his satisfying Bone Clocks? This is an author who has bended genres and brought me to my knees. However, Utopia Avenue\u2019s coverage of the counterculture 60s feels borrowed and Wiki\u2019d. By far, it\u2019s the worst slog by a notable, former first-rate author that I\u2019ve ever read, a migraine-inducing mash of mixed metaphors and insensate, ham-handed prose, bad poetry, and corny lyrics. It is riddled with clich\u00e9d, gaseous sentences that telegraph and italicize every thought and action. Here\u2019s a passage:<br /><br />\u201cJellyfish of colored light breed and smear the dancers and Jasper\u2019s mind is set adrift.\u201d Then in italics, \u201cAbracadabra, it\u2019s a boy, why not name him Jasper?\u201d (stop italics) \u201cWhy this name and not another?\u201d (start italics again) \u201cA friend? The stone? A long-lost lover?\u201d<br />\u201cPlenty more where we came from. A million per droplet of the stuff of life.\u201d<br /><br />Yeah, heavy, brother. Groovy.<br /><br />I should have been warned when Mitchell decided that Utopia\u2019s first album would be \u201cParadise is the Road to Paradise.\u201d Is this supposed to be clever? Mocking? He takes this novel seriously, and the levity is at best, puerile. How about these lyrics to their first hit, Darkroom:<br /><br />\u201cWe hid under trees from the rain and the dice; but under the trees the rain rains twice.\u201d<br />These aren\u2019t lyrics from counterculture music; it is the trivial stuff of a bubblegum chorus. (Exceptions are Richard Harris and Donna Summer, who can eloquently leave the cake out in the rain).<br /><br />It opens in 1967, and the premise is the rise and fall of a British rock band. The novel is structured in six sections by the three Utopia LPs (A and B sides), and each song centers on a different band member: Romeo-ish, cheating Dean, the bassist; Lennon-ish Jasper, the watchful and schizoaffectve-ish guitarist; Elf, singer and keyboard player with man problems; and Griff, the brash and nervy drummer from Yorkshire. The characters, like the story, are trite and swirl in the self-referential Mitchellverse. Levon, the manager, is a meta-reference to Bone Clocks. Jasper de Zoet\u2019s reference to Jacob is purposeful but insubstantial, like all of the meta- bombs. Perhaps Mitchell is reminding the reader that he once wrote novels with staying power.<br /><br />The author hammers home that it is the 60s by all the name-dropping and cameo appearances: Jagger, Bowie, Sandy Denny, Zappa, Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Jerry Garcia, Nina Simone, Pink Floyd, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, like the novel, their function is flimsy and clumsy, like Marc Bolan\u2019s, \u201cIf you want to understand me, read The Lord of the Rings. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d<br /><br />590+ pages of buzzwords, bromides, and banalities, swirling in Mitchell\u2019s past novels. A solid narrative stands on its own, without weak wink-wink plugs to an author\u2019s oeuvre. The Mitchellverse feebly tries to cover the shortcomings of this hubristic epic, but I wasn\u2019t fooled by this impersonation of an Experience. Gimme Jimi any day instead.<br /><br />I really dislike giving one star.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Still OK but not a great \"Rivers Of London\" addition", "text": "I discovered Ben Aaronovitch's PC Grant series last year when I picked up \"Midnight Riot\" on sale.  I don't read a lot of urban fantasy, so was surprised that I liked it so much.  I quickly read the rest of the series and pre-ordered \"Foxglove Summer\".<br /><br /> I loved the originality, energy and charm that ran through every book.  I even found Peter Grant's distinct Kentish town grammar (i.e., \"Beverly and me got in the car.\") charming rather than irritating.  Two things kept the series from being a solid five stars for me.  First, Aaronovitch's TV background showed in slightly choppy, confusing \"scenes\" that seemed intended to be filmed rather than read.  The other was that the character who should have been the most interesting (Nightingale) turned out to be a non-entity and never has developed much beyond that.  Oddly, neither of these are the major problem in \"Foxglove Summer\" (Nightingale barely appears) but it is my least favorite of the Grant books.<br /><br />The story takes place outside of London and it feels as though the more bucolic setting sucked the energy out of the story.  Not much happens and, other than a slight insight into Molly's background and an, um, \"incident\" between Peter and Beverly that may have ramifications later, very little adds to the Rivers of London mythos.<br /><br /> There is also an extreme oddity/illogic in the book that, unfortunately, I can't discuss without a major spoiler. Let's just say the little girl confusion irks me. The ending is very abrupt, seeming rushed and incomplete.<br /><br /> Peter Grant continues to be an interesting and charming character so the book was Ok but not much more than that.  I'm glad that I have it, but must admit that I'm a bit disappointed.  If the Rivers of London were a TV series (which is really how it reads) and each book a season, \"Foxglove Summer\" would be a \"special\" episode in the off season.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Confusing for the biblical neophyte", "text": "I wish I had better things to say about this collection of jokey paraphrases and retellings of classic Bible stories. Lord knows, the book is large-hearted enough. But it just does not live up to its subtitle, \"Introducing the Bible by telling its Stories.\" After reading the stories, it's hard to know where the joking stops and the Bible storyies begin. Those who are already familiar with the tales might enjoy a humorous rettling of an old chestnut, but those who don't know the Bible well will be confused and possibly misled. The story of Noah is a good example. We learn a bit about Gilgamesh and the flood epics in the ancient near east, but we learn only peripherally the basic story element that Noah took animals (two by two) with him into the ark. Venturing into the New Testament, the Last Supper and Crucifixion get scant attention. We hear that Jesus rides into Jerusalm on a donkey, but don't know why.<br /><br />Bob Darden frames the Bible stories in their context as myth, and lists the standard facets of mythical stories as laid out by Joseph Campbell. But this has the effect of diluting the importance of biblical stories (what's the biggie if they are only myths?) and suggesting that every biblical story has mythical elements. The bible has its share of mythical stories, but also plenty of poetry, prophetic critique and even royal propaganda.<br /><br />I admire Darden for trying to make the Bible more accessible to a growing generation of the biblically illiterate. His references to Star Wars, Harry Potter, Narnia, and Star Trek reach out to those familiar with these modern myths. But the young (and increasingly their parents) don't know the bible stories to begin with. Riffing on them is just confusing.

{"rating": 3, "title": "An engaging mystery combined with empty dilemmas: it starts well but goes downhill. Not recommended", "text": "Every day, Isserley drives the roads of the Scottish Highlands looking for beefy male hitchhikers to pick up--but not for the reasons that anyone would expect. Isolated from home, out of place among the hitchhikers, Isserley is the only link between two cultures. Under the Skin is a nightmare to summarize and even harder to review because the truth of Isserley's identity and role is a huge spoiler which is crucial to book's plot and message. Nonetheless it's safe to say: the first half of the book is an engaging, enjoyable, if imperfect mystery, but the second half is bogged down by impersonal identity issues and empty ethical quandaries. The book is a mixed bag: promising, well-intentioned, but ultimately flawed. I don't recommend it.<br /><br />Under the Skin is an odd beast: it's a fresh, unusual book, entirely well-intentioned, but littered with problems. It's also a beast to discuss without spoiling the story for potential readers--so this review may tend towards vague. The book falls approximately into two halves: before, and after, the revelation of Isserley's identity. Before is suspenseful: a slow journey through unexplained events and subtle hints builds up the mystery of Isserley's life and her true identity. This journey is so slow, in fact, that it sometimes drags; the outsider's perspective of Isserley's unsettling identity makes her a stranger to the reader, and so she's unfortunately unsympathetic. Nonetheless it's a hell of a ride: a mystery which grows stranger and stranger, drawing the reader in with a tangle of clues, startling him with the simple, yet utterly alien reveal. This half of the book is atmospheric and engrossing, fresh and unusual, and well worth reading.<br /><br />After revealing the truth of Isserley's identity, the book explores the nature of her in-between identity and the ethics of her role. (Vague, yes?) This section is well-intended but constantly faulted. Isserley's disconnected dual identity isn't sufficient alien (nor convincing), but nor (as mentioned above) is she sufficiently sympathetic, so her issues of identity are promising but ultimately unsatisfying. Her ethical dilemma is thoughtful, but it's ultimately too clear-cut and preachy to hit home. And the book entire has a weak plot--that no problem when there's suspense to propel the book, but the second half feels undirected, making Isserley's concerns seem more like navel-gazing that personal revelation. Finally, the book hash a cop-out ending which leaves a sour taste and makes Isserley's journey meaningless. This second half has potential and the best of intentions, but it's a disappointment. I'm not sure how Faber could have improved his book--shrinking the distance between Isserley and reader? taking a different angle on the impact of her identity? making her identity more believably alien? Regardless, I can't recommend a book which is only half good. As enjoyable as it's unfulfilling, as engaging as it's empty, Under the Skin is a mixed bag. Pick it up if you're curious, because there's some good to pull from it--but on the whole, I don't recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "0156011603", "parent_asin": "0156011603", "user_id": "AFEURQMGWI3LXF5Y5SAFUT5CUMOA", "timestamp": 1245711860000, "helpful_vote": 31, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Enjoyable", "text": "I watched Terminator 2 at a very young age. (Why 2? Because it is obviously the superior one) I think that it made a huge impression on me. It single handily created my love of sci-fi. In Partials the enemy might not be straight up robots but I was just as intrigued by genetically engineered organic beings. Throw a plague in on top of that and you definitely have a book I must read. I went into Partials with high expectations...maybe they were too high because I loved a lot of things but I also had a few issues with it.<br /><br />The concept is brilliant. I loved everything about it. I'm always fascinated by post-apocalyptic settings and this one was done really well. I found the Partials to be interesting, although they didn't necessarily live up to the scary hype the characters built for them. This might sound odd but I enjoyed the plague aspect of the story as well, but the chapters where Kira was just doing medical tests and experiments were very, very tiresome. I didn't mind it at first but it goes on for a long time. This leads me to my first issue, I feel like the book could have been much shorter.<br /><br />I didn't love the characters, but I didn't dislike them either. Samm was probably my favorite. He was very mysterious. I liked him from the very start. I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but I found him very sympathetic.<br /><br />I also guessed a big secret plot point within 20 pages. Then it seemed like it took forever to be revealed. I don't usually mind if I figure things out quickly but the pacing was fairly slow and I got pretty impatient at times.<br /><br />I still enjoyed the story.

Instead, its focus is entirely on the effects of oils spills and methods to clean up after them.<br /><br />The is not well written and not well researched.<br /><br />As far as the writing, even the inside flap verbiage has so much redundancy that it becomes confusing and insulting to the reader.  For example, &#34;Few other environmental problems are as common or ubiquitous.&#34;  In this case, because common and ubiquitous mean the same thing, the reader is left pondering what subtle point the author was making with this complexity.  Better writers, or editors, would edit the copy more tightly.<br /><br />The author is mostly interested in visiting sites of oil spills, then relating travel stories about birds covered in oil that she has seen.  In her forward, she is more interested in thanking her husband for helping her navigate a beach with a broken ankle than she is in the craft of writing.  If you want pictures of the author standing in a salt marsh, or pictures of birds with oil on them, this is your book.<br /><br />What really ticked me off was when she said there are few human fatalities associated with the oil industry.  This is not true, representing an insult to the brave oil riggers.  While the author's job, college teacher, does not make the top 25 dangerous jobs, the task of oil rigging does.  Tell the friends, families and survivors of the Piper Alpha fire that over 160 fatalities in a hour's time was a small loss.<br /><br />As an engineer, I've been trained to address problems at their source, where possible.  For example, piloting the Valdez so as not to collide with rocks, maintaining a collision avoidance radar and associated reflector on the rocks.

Italicized print is inconsistently used, sometimes for author notes, sometimes for the Reformer's own words. Quotation marks are mostly missing, so they are not a guide either.<br /><br />I am sad to see that there isn't more clarification here, as the overall content is really good.

Scratch is open-source, fairly easy to get into if you (or your kids) have a little tenacity in downloading, installing and walking through the interface. It reminds me a little of javascript in the syntax though I've found my kids really like Blockly (and the related Star Wars games on code.org) better and find Blockly less frustrating than Scratch.<br /><br />The book itself uses pixel versions (and some screen grabs) from Star Wars properties to teach kids about Scratch. The games are roughly Star Wars _themed_ but aren't Star Wars based, per se. This won't teach you how to make the games on Code.org, despite that Kiki Prottsman (who wrote the foreword) was curriculum developer for Code.org until the end of August 2018. If that's enough to make you stop right here, then at least this has been an honest review.<br /><br />That said, some kids respond really well to Scratch and just having some familiar Star Wars characters nearby is enough to get them into it, and that's cool and this is a book for them. But I don't think this is something that your kids can just pick up and go with; they will need some help.

Working for the President, he tried to stop the movement of suppressing women's voices but he was too passive. I could see why Jean was frustrated with him all the time. I didn't care to much about any of the other characters because we didn't really get any chances to know them. And I super had no interest in the whole plot with Lorenzo.<br /><br />\"Think about waking up one morning and finding you don't have a voice in anything.\"<br /><br />The overall plot was scary and realistic. The gradual transition from the world we know to the dystopian world we see in Vox seemed to feel natural and probable. I don't think we are on the precipice of this being our reality but I do think that this future isn't as far off as I would like it. The absolute helplessness Jean feels when it comes to trying to teach her daughter vocabulary (with both of them only having 100 words each a day) is incredibly frustrating to read. This kind of dystopian story is so much scarier to me than my normal zombie or children fighting to death in an arena dystopians because this feels like something that isn't a sci-fi or fantasy story. It feels like a warning. It makes me even more ready to speak out and to vote for the changes I want to see in this world.<br /><br />The average woman speaks about 20,000 words a day. The thought of that being cut to 100 words a day and the punishment being pain and humiliation is haunting. The women are seen as housemaids, cooks, baby makers. They punish anyone in the LGBTQ+ community and women are basically not allowed to have dreams or careers that do not involve their families. Their money is wired into their husband's bank accounts. This is all super terrifying. The book briefly talks about intersectional feminism and how important it is to have even more support for women of color. There is a biracial couple and the woman talks about her fear of being taken away from her white husband. Jean's privilege of not having that extra fear of being treated poorly for her skin color on top of being female was a really good conversation.<br /><br />\"You can't protest what you don't see coming.\"<br /><br />However, there is a sudden hard genre shift. The tone gives you complete whiplash as the reader goes through a good half of the book where we are getting this story of what would happen in society if women lost their voices. Then because of a job offer Jean gets in return for her and her daughter being able to speak the genre goes into a very scientific and clinical storyline that I honestly had almost no interest in. I skimmed every time she was in the lab because otherwise I think I would have just DNFed it. And then, we go from this scientific tone to this action tone that seems to come out of no where. I think I would have not minded that if I hadn't lost so much interest earlier on. I think it really affected my enjoyment of the book and by the end I didn't care.<br /><br />I do think this is a good debut novel. It brings up a lot of interesting topics and discussions. Vox is a great book for a book club or a Women and Gender Studies or Feminism classes. Depending on what Christina Dalcher writes next I could see myself reading another book of hers. I found myself genuinely affected, whether I felt anger, fear, sadness, when it came to the topics and discussions mentioned in this story. It made me see things in ways I maybe hadn't considered. I felt the emotions [I assume] the author wanted me to feel and at times it was blinding.<br /><br />\"'There's a resistance?' The word sounds sweet as I say it.<br />'Honey, there's always a resistance.'\"<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who advocates for women's rights. If you liked The book/show of The Handmaid's Tale, this is definitely something to pick up. I may not loved this book as a whole but the parts I did love I really loved. Like I said, it made me want to speak up more about the things I believe in, and it definitely makes me even more motivated to keep being an activist for women's rights.", "images": [], "asin": "B079WQK537", "parent_asin": "B079WQK537", "user_id": "AENCGYYB2WNLUANIANB7IYQ6KD4Q", "timestamp": 1546287648194, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

Still, some of the simpler scenes ring with authenticity so this author is one to watch - he just needs a better editor to drive for better plot structure, more realized characters and better executed twists. Even better, I'd love to see a Preston/Child-like collaboration with his partner to craft the story and characters and McGuire adding action, color and defining scenes.<br /><br />Characters: An odd mix of near-iconic and as if they were selected from central casting. The villain is very well written as a force of nature/evil but most of the other characters don't rise above TV trope land, including the main protagonist, whose tortured past is 'revealed' in a series of flashbacks (which is getting to be a tired crutch) and isn't worth the wait to find out.<br /><br />A great beach/plane read but will probably be available in Kindle Unlimited before too long.", "images": [], "asin": "B015MQA2W2", "parent_asin": "B015MQA2W2", "user_id": "AGW5XMMJEHDMHABA6CPBIPJN2ZGQ", "timestamp": 1484144884000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Author's perspective is disappointingly slanted to the hard left", "text": "I am a great fan of [[ASIN:0393059278 The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home, Revised and Updated Edition]], a book which Ms. Bauer wrote with her mother, Jessie Wise. Ms. Wise home-schooled this author and allowed her intellect to flourish. Unfortunately, she did not protect her from (or perhaps actively exposed her to) ugly, anti-freedom, anti-capitalistic ideas.<br /><br />Think I'm exaggerating? Well, check out these passages:<br /><br />Of [[ASIN:817224164X Mein Kampf]], she says that it's eerie to see Hitler's racist rants alongside other National Socialist goals that \"seem quite reasonable.\" Then she says, \"the twenty-first century may have rejected Hitler's doctrine of racial purity, but his techniques of propaganda are still much in use.\" Not by the federal government, of course, but by evil capitalists! \"They have been turned to the service of the market, rather than the nation-state.\" Nation-states don't engage in propaganda? Really?<br /><br />Of the [[ASIN:1438241569 The Communist Manifesto]], she says it's \"difficult to argue with\" Marx's description of how capitalism exploits workers \"in a world where every family restaurant cowers before the golden arches.\" She rejects his political program in favor a mixed-economy welfare state, though.<br /><br />Worst of all, she totally misses the point (or ignores it) of [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]]. To Bauer, Orwell's classic is not a condemnation of the state (which she slavishly adores), but of ... advertising! Can you believe this? \"Orwell's hell on earth didn't come about in 1984. But in his chilling, detailed version of a world where both mind and will can be manipulated by large and powerful institutions, he was decades ahead of the postmodernists and their condemnation of our advertisement-driven society.\"<br /><br />Speaking of 1984: The page count of this book is padded by entirely worthless summaries of the books covered. They don't just give you a feel for what the book is about -- they give away the entire story in less than a page. For example, the 1984 synopsis *SPOILER ALERT* tells you that O'Brien works for Big Brother, that Winston is captured, and that he eventually caves in the emotional climax and tells the state to put his lover Julia's head in with the rats instead of his own. She spills all of this! I was afraid to read the summaries of any of the books I hadn't read yet.<br /><br />This book is not entirely worthless. Some of the tips on how to get more out of your reading are quite good, and the book lists are good, too. Of course, they're chosen with a leftist/communist bent, but since leftist/communists dominate the culture, it's important for educated people to know what poison they purvey. But please, supplement your Galbraith with Murray Rothbard and your McPherson with some good revisionist Civil War history.<br /><br />In all honesty, you'd be much better off the check this one out from the library, copy down the book lists, and then read Mortimer Adler's [[ASIN:0671212095 How to Read a Book (A Touchstone Book)]] for the limited amount of good stuff contained in this book.

Several times, I came close to chucking the book, but I did plow on and came to realize, after listening to it and the following authors' interview completely, that Ireland isn't entirely at fault for her inept interpretation of the West Virginian accent (although, come on, Marin, you really must do a modicum of research on speech patterns/accents before you narrate books).

{"rating": 3, "title": "A Conspiracy Theory for Jesus Doubters", "text": "In Brief: Acharya S presents evidence that the New-Testament story of Jesus closely parallels pagan mythology. She concludes that Jesus must be a myth made up by the early Christian church. She also documents the abuses that have resulted from this myth. She does a decent job of presenting her case, and her work is informative and mildly interesting.<br /><br />In Depth: Archarya S (also known as DM Murdoch) has written The Christ Conspiracy to demonstrate her case that Jesus never existed as a man. She writes that he was created out of many pagan myths and patterned from pagan gods like Osiris and Mithra. The people in his story are actually based on astrology rather than historical men and women. Acharya describes this theme in her own words (Page 405):<br /><br />&#34;...these priest-masons passionately attempted to keep &#34;the Architect's clock,&#34; wherever they went; thus, they built celestial &#34;computers&#34; worldwide, and they taught the celestial mythos so that the sacred knowledge would never be lost. So passionate were they, that they took enormous pains to preserve the mythos and sacred knowledge and to make it understandable; yet it has been ignored, disparaged and historicized in the most vulgar manner in order to allow powermongers to compete with each other. Thus, we are inheritors of not only the physical ruins of the global civilization but the spiritual wreck as well.&#34;<br /><br />In other words, the &#34;sacred knowledge&#34; of the ancients based in various symbols and mythical gods has been made into &#34;real history&#34; by creating a Christ who has been placed into history as a man who actually walked the earth. The purpose of this deception is the acquisition of power by greedy and evil people. Our civilization has suffered tremendous losses in many ways as a result of this hoax.<br /><br />As should be clear, Acharya not only sees a historical Jesus as wrong in a factual sense, but this story is wrong morally as well. Much of The Christ Conspiracy is a denunciation of the evils of Christianity. She talks a lot about the wars and persecutions instigated by Christianity and other religions.<br /><br />How has Acharya arrived at her conclusion that Jesus never lived? She never really clarifies her logic. She does include a lot of references to other writers many of whom wrote long ago about Jesus as a myth. I believe she is arguing that since the gospel story of Jesus is so similar to myths that became popular long before the time Jesus was supposed to have lived, then it cannot be possible that his life would coincidentally be so much like these myths. There's got to be more to it than mere coincidence. Jesus must be a god made up to resemble these older pagan gods. As such, he might be more appealing to people with pagan beliefs. And as a real guy, he stands out from the crowd of those other gods.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not so sure that I agree with this logic. Yes, Jesus could have been created easily enough, but it's also entirely possible that he was a real guy who was inspired by paganism and tried to live his life in a way that it might be similar to these myths.

When Lucy's son Ben is abducted while Elvis is babysitting, and soon a threat is made regarding Elvis' past exploits long ago in Viet Nam, it mars their relationship to say the least. When Lucy's ex-husband Richard gets involved, with his own \"security\" forces and apparently unlimited resources, things get hairy in the hunt for the bad guys and the hoped for return of the kid. Before long, Elvis calls his buddy Joe Pike to ask for his help, and the plot is on.<br /><br />Frankly, we were disappointed in this tale. Elvis was in no way his usual wise-cracking self, and some stream of consciousness segments throughout, including a long foreword and after-word, were confusing and somehow hardly relevant. We also did not care for the many scene changes and shifts from the point-of-view of many different characters, so that the same scenes were sometimes replayed several times from each character's vantage point. It was almost like Crais was trying harder to write a screen-play than a crime novel. We also thought the otherwise straight-line plot was almost over-the-top violent compared to other entries in the series.<br /><br />While we thought Crais was destined to be a new favorite, now we're not too sure, as so far we're not as endeared to Cole and Pike as we thought we would be, and this particular story was not exactly up our alley.

You can also use Savage Tales for Call of Cthulhu.<br /><br />Where the Call of Cthulhu RPG excels are the written adventures, such as Chaosium's Masks of Nyarlathotep and the Cubicle 7's Cthulhu Britannia: Shadows over Scotland.

Anguiras faces Mecha G early in the film and is defeated.<br />Rodan:  Rodan is referred to as a &quot;pterodactyl.&quot;  He is in fact a Pteranodan.<br />King Kong vs. Godzilla:  Stanley ends the review with, &quot;AKA King Kong vs. Prometheus and King Kong vs. Frankenstein.&quot;  These are alternate titles for the  project that eventually got made as KK vs G. This film was never released anywhere as either KK vs. Frankenstein or KK vs. Prometheus.<br />But, it doesn't stop at the G series.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Blame the others", "text": "This book is seen as the political and economical pillar of the modern Latin American left. As such, it becomes a must-read work for everyone interested in understanding the so-called 'intellectuals' of this side of the world, who mostly share Galeano's ideas. This line of thought is almost a prerequiste to be admitted into the 'illuminated elite' of these countries.<br /><br />The author's thesis, written at the beginning of the 70's, could be summarized as follows: \"We, Latin Americans, are good people. In fact, we are so good, that foreigners have come to our land to take advantange of our good hearts. We are nothing but victims. First, the Spaniards came for us and then, the rest of European powers and the U.S. extended their claws. In no way do we have any responsibility for our sad present. We are just part of a masterplan, created by the forces of evil so we cannot develop. We represent such a threat to these developed countries that they will not let us prosper unless we become comunists. \".<br />As funny as it may sound for any rational person, Galeano actually believes that El Salvador or Honduras, for example, represents a more serious threat to the leadership of the evil imperialsts than South Korea or Singapore (who have stolen thousands of jobs from rich powers). Europe and the US are obsessed with us because we can put their supremacy in jeopardy...<br />Clearly, this na\u00efve approach follows the classical latin tradition of blaming others instead of looking inwards. The author doesn't analyze why is it possible that countries like Australia or Canada, mainly raw materials exporters in the beginning as Latin American countries, have become so good in creating wealth, becoming benchmarks of human development. His model is Cuba, who probably has the same GDP now as when he wrote the book.<br /><br />Having said this, I do share with Galeano the description of the \"conquistadores\" who came to this lands. They were looking for easy money and then go back to Spain. They were not interested in settling here. Their aim was to go back and spend the gold in luxury. But these inherited values, which naturally explain the poor development of Latin America, play no role in Galeano's version of the story. He just wants to live in a system that allows him to be like a \"conquistador\", that is living in lazyness at the expense of others, and to achieve that, no other social system has proved to be better than socialism.", "images": [], "asin": "0853459916", "parent_asin": "0853459916", "user_id": "AHBYYSW5PVA3KZMVF2VXVZA4DU5A", "timestamp": 1311713505000, "helpful_vote": 18, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

But the next two chapters, especially the interminable 45 page-long fourth chapter, which seemed mostly name dropping of all these famous people he worked with.

After the first three chapters, the only two I liked as much were those about Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, which I admit were my favorite films of his. Otherwise it's like a Facebook feed of memoirs, focusing solely on the good stuff. No introspection, no sad stories, nothing about what happened to the rest of his family. Once I got to Chapter 16, I pretty much skimmed the rest. I slowed down for the second to last and second longest chapter, his 25th, \u201cProducers on Broadway.\u201d Only because of that did I see the half a paragraph near the chapter\u2019s end where he tells us, almost in passing, that his wife Anne lost her battle with cancer.

He briefly mentions that certain systems will work while others will fail, gives one or two one-sentence tips, and then leaves this discussion to speak about how to measure performance to determine who gets a reward.  While this is important, even essential to the point of understanding implementation of reward systems, it isn't exactly what is conveyed by the title.<br /><br />This book is also lacking in a comprehensive case study.  Step one looks at clarifying behaviors vs. emotions and looks at rewriting companies' mission statements.  He gives a few examples of where these things started, but not any examples of revised mission statements, and few rewordings of emotional responses changed into behavioral adaptions.  This is something that I consider to be a necessity, and it's all together missing.<br /><br />It's a short book, containing only 130-some pages, and it could have been a gem of a book if a case study and some more concrete examples were introduced.

Any baseball fan immediately recognizes the place--the home of far more baseball players than one could imagine from such a place.<br /><br />The book begins with a sense of the hardscrabble life of those living in this community. A hard life in the sugar cane fields or the mills processing sugar cane. As the sugar industry contracted, life became even harder. There was also racism, given that people from many countries from across the Caribbean came here to work in the sugar industry when it was still booming. The Dominican Republic itself was the home for many major league players, such as Juan Marichal. Still, the number of players coming from this town is striking.<br /><br />The heart of this story, though, is one avenue that--by 2008--79 men had taken to escape the hardships. Major league baseball. Why did so many make it? As Jose Cano said (Page 222): \"Because we don't have anything else here and we weren't tall enough to play basketball.\"<br /><br />One of the most remarkable things about this book is the delineation of those major league players coming from this town.

After listening to both books, I must say that I enjoyed the second book, Stormchaser much better.<br /><br />Beyond the Deepwoods is a fast paced story about a young boy named Twig that grew up with a family of woodtrolls in the Deepwoods. When he leaves his home, he strays from the path and encounters a variety of creatures living in the Deepwoods. Some help him on his journey and others try to kill or eat him. Along the journey, Twig barely avoids being eaten and is forced to watch his friends being eaten alive. These dark elements may be too much for the young readers to handle.<br /><br />Listening to the story, I kept thinking that it was very rushed and that Twig was too passive. He just went along with whatever was happening including being kept as a pet or living with a Banderbear. It felt like a story about a boy who didn't belong with any of the creatures he encountered.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Twig finally meets his real father and has a new home. He is Twig, son of Cloud Wolf (Quintinius Verginix) the Sky Pirate and captain of the Stormchaser. He too would grow up and become a Sky Pirate and captain of his own sky ship.<br /><br />Although the second book, Stormchaser continues the story, in many ways it could be a good starting point for anyone wanting to get into the story.

{"rating": 3, "title": "More Fact Than Fiction", "text": "To be honest, the best part of this book was the historical note in the back. As a writer, I LOVED reading all about Gire's research methods, the information he used, and how he interpreted what he found. The note he included about Mary Magdalene was especially good, since most people (authors and otherwise) portray her in different ways and don't tell you how they came to the deduction that she probably was like that (i.e., a prostitute or one of the sinful women mentioned in the Gospels).<br /><br />Apart from the historical note and the author's factual representation of Ancient Rome and life as a soldier, there wasn't much that kept my attention. Like most Biblical fiction, there was a lot of head-hopping and moments of confusion concerning the POV. It was obviously written in a most omniscient point-of-view than from a particular character's perspective, even though Gire said it was written entirely from the perspective of his main character Lucius.<br /><br />I missed getting into Lucius's head and heart because of this, which really made the story less poignant than it should have been. As the centurion there at the crucifixion, I'd hoped he would have a more dramatic, emotional reaction to what he saw. Maybe it was more realistic that he didn't, but I missed all of his thoughts and emotions concerning Jesus's death and resurrection. There really was no conviction or conversion scene like I would've wanted.<br /><br />Also, the \"romance\" was way over-hyped. Without any depth to Lucius or emotion on anyone's part, any semblance of romance Gire tried to incorporate fizzled out.<br /><br />Long story short, the historical aspects were great. But the prose was lifeless, the story more fact than fiction, the characters more bland than alive.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Mixed Feelings About This One", "text": "&lt;Spoiler Alert - Plot elements may be discussed> I am really still grappling with my thoughts on this book, which tells me I wasn't head-over-heels thrilled with it. Firstly, having grown up in the generation that was raised with the likes of Godzilla, King Kong, and all the 1950's movies with giant fauna of all sorts, I am a sucker for a good monster story. Secondly, as a big fan of Mr Robinson's previous works, especially the Chess Team novels which also deal with monstrous creations, I was eagerly anticipating this \"Kaiju\" thriller. I think because Mr Robinson's previous works were so good that I am a bit disappointed in Nemesis. Don't misunderstand - it is still a good read, but not on the same level as his Chess Team novels. The story has an interesting angle in how the giant creature comes to pass, and leaves open the door for sequels. There is a great deal of action, and the pace never bogs down with pseudo-science explanations. All the usual suspects are here as well: an affable and goofy hero trying to be the hero; a tough-as-nails babe cop who mysteriously is attracted to the bumbling hero; the geeky office trolls; and of course, the government bureaucrats who know best how to do things rather than the guys in the field. The thing which has me conflicted was the alternating first-person and third-person perspectives. My personal preference has always been for third person omnipotent, because when reading, we all tend to identify with a character or the hero. If the first-person character is a fool, then it is a less pleasurable ride. The hero in Nemesis can't make up his mind if he is an immature slacker or a no-holds barred hero. Some of his musings are supposed to be humorous, I'm sure, but tend to be just a peep show into an immature, and often crude, mind. The third person sections were far superior, and more in line with Mr Robinson's other excellent writings. In spite of all this, it was still a good read, just not his best work. I would look forward to more of the \"Kaiju\" story line if the first person perspective were dropped, and the hero grew up some.", "images": [], "asin": "0988672510", "parent_asin": "0988672510", "user_id": "AHBLTFMER4HXDGD5N6NQ7X5FNSXA", "timestamp": 1359048231000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Good for a first novel", "text": "It's an entertaining book. How you react to it will depend on what you care about most in a book/series.<br /><br />The world is somewhat interesting. The book is a fairly standard example of \"we are the people who deal with things that go bump in the night\", but the creatures (\"predators\") are at least nicely described. I would have liked to see more details here. It would have been no trouble to cut a lot from the later, overlong parts of the book to make room to describe the predators, and make them more visible.<br /><br />The protagonist and his boss travel around fighting evil - although his boss is clearly on the border between ruthless and evil herself. There is enough backstory that the characters seemed like they existed before this story starts, which makes it feel more \"real\". Some more interaction with the other members of \"twenty palaces\" would have help set the stage a little better, though.  Why Twenty? What Palaces? Why someone would name a series after something completely absent from the book is slightly mystifying. There's only the protagonist and his boss in the whole story, from the organization side.<br /><br />Where the story falls down though, is two areas. The first is plausibility (I know, an odd thing to say about a story of werewolves and demons). But many things just don't really make sense - like the fact that these representatives of powerful wizards (who have lawyers, with pull in the mundane world) drive a crappy van and have no support. If you can afford lawyers, you can afford mercenaries. Or the fact that our hero runs around solo most of the time, leaving the more powerful, and potentially much more interesting boss offstage. Or just the implausible \"the boss wants to kill him, but her bosses insist she a) not kill him, and b) work with him\". Yeah, there's good management.<br /><br />There are a lot of times when it looks like the writer is just selecting implausible choices because they make the plot twist the way he wants it to. As long as you don't think about it, it's fine. I kept getting bumped out of the story and thinking \"does that make sense\"? And it doesn't.<br /><br />The second is the slow pace of the second half of the book. Once you've figured out who the villain is, and what he's up to, you should be getting near the end of the book. This book could have been a hundred pages shorter, without losing anything significant. I'd also liked to have seem much more of the villain. As it was, the villain was totally generic, with almost no personality (or even stage time).<br /><br />The comparisons with Jim Butcher are reasonable - but it's more in the same genre, it's not a Dresden clone. It's darker, and the characters more messed up. It's not as good as Butcher is now, but neither was Butcher's first book.<br /><br />It kept me entertained for a few hours, and I have high hopes that the obvious flaws will get corrected in later books in the series. I'll buy the next one, because I think they will get better, and the things he got right give the series a good base to build from.", "images": [], "asin": "0345508890", "parent_asin": "0345508890", "user_id": "AHSPVVKIYJCR5RHEIHO6VVS66ONQ", "timestamp": 1274003685000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

Goyer has written Batman Begins, Dark City, Blade, The Dark Knight,  and Man of Steel, and Cassutt has written for the TV shows Max Headroom, Stargate, Farscape, and Eerie, Indiana.  Consequently, there is more emphasis on action than ideas.  There is also one key plot development that is so implausible that I was surprised to see it in a novel, although I would not have been surprised at its inclusion in a movie or television program, for which I have lower standards.

I believe Grafton keeps Kinsey in the past because detecting and investigating were so much harder before the days of interwebby access to everyone's personal information.  Instead of two clicks and learning all about a subject, she conducts labored investigations hitting libraries, police departments, hospitals, and newspapers offices to get her info and this really drags out the plot. And I mean REEEEALLY drags out the plot. (Searching microfiche records?  Seriously?  Does Grafton know how many readers do not even know or recall what microfiche was?)  On top of that, Grafton's descriptive style has reached an exponential level.  Just the act of placing of a phone call became two paragraphs describing how she looked at the phone, picked up the receiver, punched numbers (What?  Not dialed on a rotary?), rested  the handset on her shoulder to her ear, listened to the ringing, and then waited for pickup.  Gee, I described all that in one sentence; I could be a mystery writer.  Using the electric typewriter suffered a similar dissection as did almost every other minor act. Thank God we didn't have to hear about Kinsey tying her shoe laces. That may have required a volume 2.  Without all the hyper-description, the book could have been 75 pages long and I could have saved several hours.  The plot was so boring and characters unremarkable that I kept waiting for some moment of clarity or a major plot twist.  I still don't get why the photo of Ned & his mom were so important.  Okay, it was a photo.  What great revelation came from it?  None but it was discussed and discussed.  Yawn.<br /><br />Keeping Kinsey in the recent past prevents any kind advancement in her own personality and growth as a person.  She's still jogging the same 3 miles but never seems to get better at it.  The quirks that endeared Kinsey early on are beginning to sound like she's some sort of emotional cripple or immature misanthrope who cannot grow up--just a weirdo, and not a cute weirdo, just weird.<br /><br />I will finish out the series because there are only a couple volumes left plus I started reading Grafton when she first appeared on the scene all those years ago but I hope the last two are better than X.<br /><br />P.S.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A highwayscribery \"Book Report\"", "text": "Had Kurt Vonnegut died in January 2009 his literary goodbye, \"A Man Without a Country,\" might have been brighter.<br /><br />Maybe the sea change in American politics was already affecting Vonnegut when he passed on April 11, 2007, but this book, his last sigh, had been published in 2005.<br /><br />That means it would have been written the year before, an annus horribilis, marked by the American peoples' unfortunate validation of George W. Bush's presidency.<br /><br />So Vonnegut, an avowed socialist, was pretty soured on the United States. And that resulted in his swan song being a mixture of a trademark whimsy and heavy doses of dead seriousness.<br /><br />For the book-loving, Vonnegut unpacked this chestnut:<br /><br />\"Do you realize that all great literature -- 'Moby Dick,' 'Huckleberry Finn,' 'A Farewell to Arms,' 'The Scarlet Letter,''The Red Badge of Courage,' 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey,' 'The Bible,' and 'The Charge of the Light Brigade,' -- are all about what a bummer it is to be a human being? (Isn't it such a relief to have somebody say that?)\"<br /><br />Maybe it's a relief if you've lived well and are on the way out, but if a good stretch of road is still in front of you, not so much.<br /><br />In \"Man Without...\" the famed writer riffed often on the oil problem, our national addiction, and the increasingly desperate decisions being made by the country's leaders to placate that addiction.<br /><br />\"Evolution can go to hell as far as I'm concerned. What a mistake we are. We have mortally wounded this sweet life-supporting planet -- and the only one in the whole Milky Way -- with a century of transportation whoopee.\"<br /><br />But, as can be seen from this quote's opening beats, oil addiction is but a symptom. It's the human race that rots.<br /><br />Why was Vonnegut a man without a country? Here's a decent stretch, long in inches, but short in bandwidth, wherein he lays out his case in the writerly way:<br /><br />\"Loaded pistols are good for everyone except inmates in prisons or lunatic asylums.<br />That's correct.<br />Millions spent on public health are inflationary.<br />That's correct.<br />Billions spent on weapons will bring inflation down.<br />That's correct.<br />Dictatorships to the right are much closer to American ideals than dictatorships to the left.<br />That's correct.<br />The more hydrogen bomb warheads we have, all set to go off at a moment's notice, the safer humanity is and the better of the world will be that our grandchildren inherit.<br />That's correct.<br />Industrial wastes, and especially those that radioactive, hardly ever hurt anybody, so everybody should shut up about them.<br />That's correct.<br />Industries should be allowed to do whatever they want to do: Bribe, wreck the environment just a little, fix prices, screw dumb customers, put a stop to competition, and raid the Treasury when they go broke.<br />That's correct.<br />That's free enterprise.<br />And that's correct.<br />The poor have done something very wrong or they wouldn't be poor, so their children should pay the consequences.<br />That's correct.<br />The United States of America cannot be expected to look after its own people.<br />That's correct.<br />The free market will do that.<br />That's correct.<br />The free market is an automatic system of justice.<br />That's correct.<br />I'm kidding.\"<br /><br />Which reminds us of how good writers communicate deep concepts with simplicity and economy.<br /><br />Vonnegut was dead-set against the war in Iraq. His chief grievance was the unprovoked nature of the military action and he drafted a historical parallel with the U.S. invasion of Mexico in the 19th Century.<br /><br />\"More than a decade before his Gettysburg Address, back in 1848, when Lincoln was only a Congressman, he was heartbroken and humiliated by our war on Mexico, which had never attacked us. James Polk was the person Representative Lincoln had in mind when he said what he said. Abraham Lincoln said of Polk, his president, his armed forces' commander-in-chief:<br /><br />Trusting to escape scrutiny, by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory - that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood - that serpent's eyes, that charms to destroy - he plunged into war.<br /><br />Holy s..t! And I thought I was a writer!\"<br /><br />We told you there was whimsy melded into book's gloomy view.<br /><br />One chapter revisits an old Vonnegut favorite about the simplicity of successful story structure, but then goes a step further wherein he demonstrates why \"Shakespeare was as poor a storyteller as any Arapaho,\" whose true virtue was that he told the truth in a world where the truth is in short supply.<br /><br />A lifetime of literary creation and consumption led our subject to crown poet Carl Sandburg a personal favorite, and Ambrose Bierce's \"Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\" as a \"flawless example of American genius like, 'Sophisticated Lady' by Duke Ellington or the Franklin stove.\"<br /><br />He warns writers off using semi-colons, \"transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing.\" And then, after using one, remarks, \"The point is: Rules only take us so far, even good rules.\"<br /><br />\"Man Without a Country\" plugs Eugene Debs and plies the sad story of Ignaz Semmelweis.<br /><br />This gentleman convinced his unbelieving fellow doctors that leaving the morgue after doing autopsies to perform surgery on live patients, without washing their hands first, was causing a lot of death.<br /><br />It is a story of truth spurned and suicide and one of the reasons, along with Vonnegut's presence at the firebombing of Dresden, he lost hope in the human race.<br /><br />Like my distinct betters Einstein and Twain, I now give up on people, too. I am a veteran of the Second World War and I have to say this is not the first time I have surrendered to a pitiless war machine.<br /><br />My last words? 'Life is no way to treat an animal, not even a mouse.'\"<br /><br />Perhaps it was the responsibility of Vonnegut's editor to loyally assist in the assaying of a downer document. We expect these things from older people. Their pessimism completes the arc of our devolutionary intellectual development.<br /><br />But we also expect wisdom from a life lived well and fully. So highwayscribery is going to step in and close this report with something that appeared at the beginning of the book and, for that reason, may have been lost to those who closed \"A Man Without a Country,' in gloom.<br /><br />It is advice with which highwayscribery agrees, often propounds to novice writers, and finds worthy of such a fine man and artist:<br /><br />\"If you want to hurt your parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Has some problems, but an enjoyable read", "text": "\"The Familiar Stranger\" is a contemporary Christian fiction novel. The pacing was very good, and the world-building was okay. In the first half of the novel, a noticeable amount of dialogue (including inner dialogue) felt unnatural to me--and I'm not talking about when awkward dialogue might be expected. In the second half, though, this problem disappeared and the writing was excellent.<br /><br />The characters were sympathetic enough characters, but the only ones I really bonded with were the kids. This may partly be because I've never seriously dated or been married or had a loved one in a bad accident so I couldn't personally relate to the stress the adults were going through. I did like the way the author handled the struggles that the characters went through, though.<br /><br />I suspect most people will thoroughly enjoy the novel, but I didn't fully enjoy it because there were two or three \"mighty convenient\" things that happened at critical points in the story to make it end up where it did. I would have liked for these points to have been fleshed out to make them more realistic and probable.<br /><br />The characters were Christians living out their faith. The novel wasn't preachy, but there was a large amount of God-talk and praying. Non-Christians probably wouldn't enjoy this book. There was no sex and no bad language. Overall, it's an enjoyable book and good, clean reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debbie from Genre Reviews (genrereviews. blogspot. com)", "images": [], "asin": "0802447317", "parent_asin": "0802447317", "user_id": "AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA", "timestamp": 1253289923000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

Picard and Spock working together. The Cold War between the Romulans and the Federation getting renewed after the Dominion War. Even a mention of a post-Sisko Deep Space Nine. Alas, the authors' reach exceeded their grasp.<br /><br />The action jumped from scene to scene with many loose ends left untied. What exactly was the point of the Lotre character? What did T'sart want with the device and why was he even in the book? Folan's actions had no consequences. And all the secondary characters and subplots: Tobin and Nien, the aforementioned DS9, the Klingons. All these elements were thrown together in one big stew without much organization.<br /><br />That said, I did like the Picard, Spock, Data interaction and the dialogue between Data, Riker, and Troi. In fact, I think Galanter and Brodeur have a real knack for writing for Data. Some of his scenes were downright amusing.<br /><br />But even that could not make up for the incomprehensible ending. All those theories and mysterious tools and omnipotent aliens were just too much to keep track of and I still don't understand what happened. I think some Trek authors have fallen in the same trap that many Star Wars writers fell into: the superweapon-of-the-week.

It also seems like one sibling will be more dominant over the other.<br /><br />Like in the case of our protagonist. The night brother is a special inspector, so his job takes precedence over his day brother who is a musician. When the inspector has to leave town on an investigation, the day brother has no choice but to follow, no matter how inconvenient that is for his professional and personal life.\u00a0<br /><br />I would have loved to explore this fascinating world a bit more. Like what happens to the children of those married couples? If the night sister is the mother of the children, but the day sister is unmarried and leads a completely different life, who takes care of the children during the day? Especially when they are babies? Does the day sister have a choice in the matter or is she forced to care for them no matter what? Wouldn't that create resentment between the siblings? Wouldn't the children suffer because of that?<br /><br />The mystery itself is rather complex and progresses at a very leisury pace. In fact almost half the book is setup, and even though the story picks up in the second half, it can still be a slog. There are also some leaps of logic that I found hard to follow. And some plot holes that were rather glaring. Like we are expressly told that the father packed up his family and left town after his wife was arrested. Yet, both the oldest and the youngest children are conveniently present to be sacrificed for the ritual. How did that happen? Also, where is the middle sister and the father? Also, this horrible murder of children isn't even mentioned or addressed in any way afterwards. And the mother doesn't express a single ounce of grief or regret over it. And that is the night-sister that gave birth and raised those children.\u00a0<br /><br />All in all, it was interesting mostly for the unique concept and worldbuilding, but I wasn't totally onboard for the story itself. And while I liked both Christophor and Alexander, I wasn't as thrilled with the other characters in this book. And I would have loved a few more answers to the day-to-day conundrum that having two souls in one body represents, because from where I stand, this is the definition of hell.<br /><br />PS: I received a free copy via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "1801101647", "parent_asin": "1801101647", "user_id": "AHQT3JAIHOGZUP7ADMFMYOCOGGMA", "timestamp": 1678112280106, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Very literary but not very thrilling", "text": "A former Israeli assassin called Shakespeare, now running an advertising agency and attending a meeting with a drug company in New York City, meets by chance a man he had once been assigned to kill. He believed this man, Tino the Syrian, to be dead after a confrontation in the Libyan desert long ago. After a body was recovered, a Belgian pathologist supposedly confirmed his death. Shakespeare attempts to track him down and gets involved with a sales assistant and part time hooker whose pimp is Tino. Satisfied that Tino and the man on the street are the same, Shakespeare sets out to kill him.<br /><br />A plot summary doesn't really sum up this novel very well since it's told in a violently fragmented, non-linear way. It's far more psychological, dream-like and meandering than most thrillers and it's really primarily a literary novel which features a few thriller elements rather than an intricately plotted crime fiction novel.<br /><br />The main character was a member of the unit assigned to track down those responsible for murdering Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. A few flashbacks recount the secret missions of the unit but most of the book explores the themes of fragmented identity, the Jewish experience in the twentieth century and the history of Israel. The author, Joshua Sobol, has won the Sapir Prize, an important literary prize in Israel, and has written many plays.<br /><br />Though much of the book focuses on the memories and experiences of the main character with the chase relegated to the background, the novel does achieve a bit of suspense at the end with a shoot-out in the New Mexico desert. However, those who read this novel for the literary qualities are more likely to be satisfied than those who come looking for a thriller.", "images": [], "asin": "1935554212", "parent_asin": "1935554212", "user_id": "AGEHSZ5MULUYPSHGJDWAUNPP5NMQ", "timestamp": 1299036650000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

I think unabridged is the way to go in most, if not all, cases. But the reader just isn't that interesting to listen to, unfortunately. Maybe I have a shorter attention span than I thought, but I just kept losing interest throughout.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Lot's of missed potential", "text": "I was given a free copy of this book in return for my honest review free of persuasion from the author or anyone else associated with the book.<br /><br />The Emerald Key is a young children's story about a group of friends and their adventure into a fairy world where myths are real and dragons are a regular occurrence.<br /><br />The book started off nicely by introducing all main characters and giving an insight into their personality as well as daily routine. Penny and Lacy are the heroines of the story and the two fit nicely into the popular stereotype of school-aged kids. The two can't be more different. Penny is headstrong, beautiful, confident, capable, and loyal friend while Lacy is the smart, shy, always invisible girl. Later on we are introduced to their two companions which happened to be the boys trying to bully them (although in a friendly way). The story develops rapidly with the protagonists finding themselves in a new world rather quickly. They are immediately introduced to their handsome guide who just happened to agree to follow and help them with their seemingly simple mission.<br /><br />This is where, in my opinion, the author ran into some difficulties. Everything about this new world is just too convenient even for a story intended for kids in junior high. Lacy just happens to have a magical book about dragons in her bag and is immediately aware of what to do and how to use it. Upon entering the world, they just came upon this boy that doesn't even seem to find them strange. Everyone speaks English and this fact is never questioned even once.  There is no true explanation about this magical world. We just hear bits and pieces from the local boy and most seem to be connected (in a disjointed way) to various myths from all main ancient civilizations. All this gave me an impression that the author was just making up the story on the go without any prior planning.<br /><br />The action also seemed very flat with no twists or turns - everything just happens to work out just because Penny is so strong and determined and Lacy is smart. Their two companions from back home add no flavor to the story except for bits of humor. Throughout the journey the kids did not learn any lessons or develop any new traits which I think is the most disappointing thing about a story aimed at young kids.<br /><br />Overall, The Emerald Key left me wanting more.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Neat ending, but a struggle", "text": "The book was a disappointment for me: I was hoping for a solidly written tale and a new incredible author. But I really did not find either of these in this book.<br /><br />The author, as another reviewer mentioned, talks too much. There was just too much detail, which detracted from telling a decent story. The back-and-forth of Aurelia's discussions with her conscience were distracting and something of a turnoff...\"I can do this\" vs. \"You can't do this!\"\u2014over and over, making Aurelia seem a little wifty. It took away from her character\u2014she's described as a spy of some talent, but with a wishy-washy personality, it just did not convince, though I wish it had. (There is no rhyme or reason, by the time we approach the turning point, for her to decide that SHE has to do something about the deaths taking place\u2014the reader is never prepared with Aurelia to understand WHY she feels that way\u2014that thread is never really presented and developed in her.) Some of the language seemed unsuited to the time: for example, \"passel\"\u2014though it's a 19th C. word (I looked it up), it sounds like it belongs in a Western. Also, Aurelia has had three names...that gets confusing and old\u2014and at one point, with no warning, Jason begins to refer to her as Relia. It just comes out of nowhere, having never been used before, and I had to go back to figure out who he was talking about. The author's use of French phrases felt contrived...I don't speak French. At times phrases were explained (even just in context), at other times not...but I just didn't care enough to look them up. Speaking a few phrases does not necessarily create a French character\u2014and I could not understand the reason to try to do so. (Maybe I missed something at the beginning?!\u2014and the beginning does not fit either.) Plot development was rickety...it stumbled in places, rather than flowing along. And the villain just comes out of the blue\u2014I didn't feel like there was any inkling of the person's identity, no subtle clues craftily left like breadcrumbs so the ending provided an \"ah-ha\" moment\u2014it did not! And there were unanswered questions as to why this person killed some of his/her victims.<br /><br />With all that said, the characters are relatively well \"fleshed out.\" They are likeable if not always believable/consistent. But there was enough substance in each that I felt I got to \"know\" them and could cheer them on...to a point. The ghosts, as one reviewer mentioned, were quite a mix of personalities, and really provided a segment of the plot that was unexpected and enjoyable. The turning point of the story was good, as mentioned. Clever.<br /><br />Gabriel, I thought, was a beast, though the author tried to provide him with some moral fiber\u2014he and his entire entourage were, I thought, awful. Redeeming qualities in some? Hard to buy into when the reader knows why they have all gathered with the same intent, the same behaviors, mindsets. Jason's change by the end didn't seem realistic to me\u2014that kind of change does not take place in pages...maybe building throughout the book?... and the ending was just unrealistic\u2014giving the story something of a Cinderella feel.<br /><br />Would I recommend this author?

{"rating": 3, "title": "Good first book for those just starting the road to living debt free. Falls short for most others", "text": "Not much originality in this book to be honest. If you've read articles on debt repayment, none of what Mr. Ramsey has to say should be new to you.<br /><br />The idea of a debt snowball is ONE approach to tackling your outstanding debts. As he himself admits, it is not the most number-driven approach. Attacking the highest interest debt first makes the most sense, while the debt snowball method takes care of smaller amounts of debt offering small, quick victories. He likens it to a marathon- it is tough to go from walking less than a mile to finishing a marathon. Basically, celebrate the small victories even if it does cost you a little more in the end.<br /><br />My major problem with his approach, and many others, is the emergency fund. It is essential for a family to have a &#34;rainy day&#34; fund. Bad times will happen. It is not a matter of if, but when. Mr. Ramsey advocates saving $1000 and using the rest of your available money that is not already earmarked to tackle your debt. If you have a small, unexpected expense crop up, use your emergency fund and stop repaying the debt until you've reestablished your emergency fund. Sounds like a solid plan. It keeps you from borrowing more money when faced with life's unforeseen circumstances.<br /><br />What happens when the emergency surpasses that $1000 mark? Sure you could reduce the money you're repaying on your debt, but that assumes you will have enough to cover the expense. What if you don't? You'll be back to borrowing money, the very thing you were trying to avoid. Now, I'm not advocating amassing a huge emergency fund while your debt continues to pile up, but 1,000 seems extremely low for most families. In Mr. Ramsey's defense he does say to eventually build up your emergency fund to a 3 or 6 month reserve, but it is the in between that makes me nervous. Why not build more of your emergency fund first and then tackle the debt? That way you would have some cushion and not need to worry as much about things cropping up unexpectedly that will likely surpass a $1000 price tag.", "images": [], "asin": "0785289089", "parent_asin": "0785289089", "user_id": "AF2PPSBAI2BQZR66C2U7FS2DMIFA", "timestamp": 1460466873000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Heyer and Austen need not worry", "text": "(Gratefully borrowed from the Greater Phoenix Digital Library, which is why this is not a verified purchase.)<br /><br />It's possible my expectations were set too high, but wow, what a letdown. Whoever wrote the book description, &#34;a novel to make Jane Austen proud and Georgette Heyer envious,&#34; had delusions of grandeur. Jude Morgan can write well, but his skills of characterization need improvement; his characters fall flat. Here's what I mean:<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS...<br /><br />First, there is no hero in the novel. Three possibilities for the role don't pass muster. One, modeled after Darcy, I suppose, is cold, haughty and reserved, all right, but his character is too disgusting to redeem. Sensing this, the author merely throws in an equally-frigid character he can win more easily. Another, whose sullenness the heroine for some unfathomable reason finds attractive, is meant to be Heathcliff-like, or Byronic, or something, but instead of charming, he comes across as pouting and angry for no clear reason. Any charming aspect of his character is too poorly conveyed by the author to be noticeable. And a third one is such a dull wooden character that I'm not at all surprised that the heroine never had a clue he felt anything at all for her. I was still debating that myself, as the novel ended.<br /><br />An attempt to include characters whose quirks can reliably amuse us is a little more successful, but the most humorous ones are near the beginning of the story and are dropped as the book progresses. One would have thought that Mrs. Lappage, for example, carefully drawn at the beginning of the novel, would play an ongoing role, but she disappears 35% into the novel. Another promising character, Miss Rose, a female Uriah Heep, is, regrettably, dropped after only a few memorable contributions to conversation.<br /><br />Caricature and subtlety do not work well together; therefore, I assume Mr. Morgan did not intend to call more attention to the quirks of Sophie, who perhaps was intended to be a less disingenuous Isabella Thorpe. Whatever his intention, Sophie is not clearly developed. Nor is her mother, whose character, I think, was supposed to be a more easily pleased Mrs. Bennet, any more fully-realized.<br /><br />Two villains in the novel also suffer from lack of character development. Suspension of disbelief for the femme fatale is especially difficult, and the couple's longterm lifestyles and machinations are not believable.<br /><br />A secondary character, sister of one of the supposed heroes, intended to be sympathetically portrayed, I think, is yet another whose personality is barely developed and whose action in the plot is lacking.<br /><br />The author's wry observations, and the graceful writing, are striking. Perhaps that makes the letdown worse. I started reading this novel wondering how I could find his other novels, since so few are in e-book format, or even in paper form in my library. Having read this novel, I am less inclined to search for any others.", "images": [], "asin": "1250038189", "parent_asin": "1250038189", "user_id": "AFICUW7LDQ23GIKDGQEISONHHKEA", "timestamp": 1532835448570, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 3, "title": "The new social structure is in trouble  \ud83d\ude44", "text": "3.5 stars<br /><br />In Pierce Brown's 'Red Rising Trilogy' which precedes this book, humans - who had colonized the entire Solar System - were separated into caste-like Color categories. The ruling &quot;Golds&quot; were on top and the low-level &quot;Reds&quot; were on the bottom. The Reds were essentially slaves, who had short brutal lives in the underground mines of Mars. Other Color groups worked as medical personnel, soldiers, police, artists, sex workers, bureaucrats, household help, and so on.<br /><br />The original trilogy revolves around Darrow, who was born a Red. After being surgically transformed to look like a Gold, Darrow infiltrated Gold society and - after rising through the ranks - became known as Darrow au Andromedus of Lykos.<br /><br />Darrow eventually led a revolution that overthrew Gold rule. This led to the establishment of a democracy that would (theoretically) allow all Color groups to have equal rights. Thus, at the end of the trilogy I thought things in the Solar System were running down the right track.<br /><br />NOT SO FAST!!<br /><br />In 'Iron Gold' - the first book of Pierce Brown's new series -it's ten years after the revolution. A Solar Republic has been established, with an 'all Color' Senate on Luna (Earth's moon). The Senate debates and enacts legislation, with input from all sides. The head of the Senate, and elected Sovereign of the Republic, is Virginia au Augustus - a Gold who happens to be Darrow's wife. Darrow is the military leader of the Republic, and he's in big trouble.<br /><br />After the revolution, Gold factions retained control of Mercury, Venus, and the Outer Rim. The Golds hate Darrow, whom they consider a Red usurper, and call him the 'Slave King.'<br /><br />To wrest control of Mercury from the Golds, Darrow unleashed a massive bombing attack on the small planet - called an 'Iron Rain.' This was successful, but resulted in immeasurable damage and cost hundreds of millions of lives. The Senate didn't give permission for the Iron Rain and plans to put Darrow on trial. However, Darrow has no intention of allowing this to happen.<br /><br />To further peace in the Solar System, Darrow feels compelled to free Venus, which is under the thumb of Gold leader Magnus au Grimmus, also known as the Ash Lord. Darrow plans to kill the Ash Lord, a feat that's almost impossible since Magnus never leaves his impregnable fortress home.<br /><br />Darrow devises a complex plan to slay the Ash Lord, but he must first escape from Luna with his most loyal supporters.....leaving his wife and their son Pax behind. Darrow is torn between his duties as a warrior and his responsibilities as a husband and father, and this haunts him throughout the novel.<br /><br />Though Darrow is an important protagonist in this new series, other characters also take center stage. These include:<br /><br />Ephraim ti Horn, a Gray who fought for the revolution, but became disillusioned after his husband was brutally murdered. Grief-stricken and angry, Ephraim left the military to become a professional thief. Ephraim recruited a small group of helpers, and now accepts commissions to steal specific items such as artworks, weapons, and so on. When a vicious crime lord hires Ephraim to steal some very valuable commodities, big trouble ensues.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Lyria of Lagalos, an 18-year-old Red girl who was liberated from the Martian mines after the rebellion. Lyria and her extended family were placed in a refugee camp on the surface of the planet, and promised assistance from the Republic. The administration didn't come through, however, and Lyria lost most of her family to a terrorist attack.<br /><br />When the government finally sends troops to Mars, Lyria rescues an injured Gold warrior named Kavax au Telemanus from drowning. The wealthy man repays Lyria by taking her into his household on Luna, where she works as a servant. Uneducated, na\u00efve, and lonely, Lyria falls under the influence of a dapper, charming older man. Once again, this leads to trouble.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Lysander au Lune, a 20-year-old Gold who's the grandson of Octavia au Lune - the Sovereign who ruled the Empire before the rebellion. After his grandmother was killed, Lysander was taken under the wing of Cassius au Bellona - a Gold who was once Darrow's friend....but is now his mortal enemy.<br /><br />As Lysander and Cassius are wandering around the Solar System in their armored craft they come upon a stranded ship in deep space. This leads to the rescue of a young Gold woman named Seraphina au Raa, who's the daughter of Romulus au Raa - leader of the Outer Rim. As a result, Lysander and Cassius - instead of being thanked - are made prisoners of Seraphina's mother, the merciless Dido au Raa.<br /><br />Lysander and Cassius learn that Dido is planning a massive attack on the inner planets, to try to re-establish Gold rule. The newcomers can either assist with the assault.....or face the consequences. Tough call!<br /><br />*****<br /><br />The book is chock full of clever tactics, stealthy maneuvers, and deadly battles, and the characters have all manner of futuristic weapons and protective armor - which I picture as flexible 'Iron Man' suits. Pierce Brown populates the book with a large array of characters, including several favorites from the Red Rising Trilogy, such as: Sevro au Barca (Darrow's best friend); Victra au Barca (Sevro's wife); Dancer (Darrow's former mentor, now a powerful Senator); Kieran (Darrow's brother); Rhonna (Darrow's niece); and more.<br /><br />The author wisely includes a list of characters at the beginning of the book, with thumbnail descriptions, which I found very useful. Pierce Brown also provides a map of the Solar System, with the location of the various factions, which helped me orient myself in the Solar Republic.<br /><br />For me, 'Iron Gold' didn't stir the same positive emotions as the original trilogy. In the first three books I cheered on the abused Reds who were struggling for freedom and equality. In this new trilogy, the narcissistic, entitled Golds are scheming to re-take (what they think is ) their rightful place in society.....and I'm not on board for that.<br /><br />I almost wish Pierce Brown had just started a new series that takes place in a different world with new characters.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the story is well-written, exciting, and suspenseful, and I recommend it to fans of science fiction/adventure tales. The book could be read as a standalone, but for maximum pleasure it's best to read the Red Rising Trilogy first.", "images": [], "asin": "042528591X", "parent_asin": "042528591X", "user_id": "AHNZRQNJHNSBVKERNXSWNLKOZ6YQ", "timestamp": 1525734382667, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Highly Imaginative", "text": "I chose to read From a Buick 8 by Stephen King as a Lovecraftian read. I had heard mixed opinions about the novel. Some people hated it, and other people felt it is very underrated, overlooked, and deserves more credit. In other words they love it. I have to say I am a bit torn as to my opinion, but maybe my review can shed some light.<br /><br />From a Buick 8 is a story that focuses on the son of a deceased Pennsylvania State Trooper, and a mysterious Buick Roadmaster that shows up in their town. Ned is the son of the late Trooper Curtis Wilcox, and the men and women of Troop D decide to sit down and talk with Ned. The aged Troopers tell Ned a tale that leaves him with more questions. Will their complete story answer questions from days gone by? Will the Buick\u2019s mysteries be revealed? Will more death ensue?<br /><br />I love King\u2019s writing, and of course his story telling and descriptiveness is amazing. From a Buick 8 is a book I feel may grow on you in time. I really enjoyed the telling of the story that spanned from the late 70\u2019s to 2001. It was also interesting how it was told by the older Troop D Troopers. A lot of the descriptions require a lot of imagination. (When it comes to the Buick). I am also torn by the ending.<br /><br />Overall I give From a Buick 8 by Stephen King three and a half stars out of five stars. I really enjoyed the book, but it wasn\u2019t my absolute favorite. It definitely is a book that makes you think, and use your imagination. There was an issue I saw where King said in one chapter that Curt was the one Trooper who didn\u2019t Smoke when they went to the diner. Then a few chapters later it said his wife nagged him to quit smoking for years. That bothered me. I also felt a little bummed at the end outcome even though the journey was fantastic.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Useful references for superhero comic illustrators", "text": "&#34;Freehand Figure Drawing for Illustrators&#34; would be better titled &#34;Mannequin Figures from Any Angle.&#34; The book mostly provided reference illustrations rather than detailed instructions on drawing a figure without any reference. If you don't have a live model or photo reference, you can use this book to look up a variety of poses from a wide variety of angles (front, back, 3/4, high, low, etc.).<br /><br />The author provided many reference illustrations: mannequins and parts of mannequins from different angles and anatomy labels for the ear, hand, foot, a full skeleton, and major muscles. He described in step-by-step detail how to draw a head, hand, and foot. He also described in a generalized, &#34;it'll be about here&#34; way how different angles affect the apparent placement or size of various features.<br /><br />The author assumed a certain amount of previous experience in drawing figures. For example: in his first section, he explained perspective and how to draw a box in perspective. He then gave a two-step lesson: (1) a rotated box viewed from low perspective (2) a fully rendered figure in that box. I was hoping for help in drawing a mannequin correctly into that perspective box or through using perspective lines. That help is never provided beyond a few, brief tips.<br /><br />The mannequins were all super-hero types (skinny women or muscled men) and many of the references were from extreme angles or of exaggerated movements. From this, I assume the book is really targeted at superhero comic illustrators, and it's probably quite useful for them. But I'm more interested in drawing normal humans in natural poses. I got some useful tips, but it's not really geared toward my interests.<br /><br />I received this book as a review copy from the publisher.", "images": [], "asin": "0385346239", "parent_asin": "0385346239", "user_id": "AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA", "timestamp": 1439229447000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

The judge is portrayed as an uncool character, and did not impress me as a credible portrait of even a judge such as he is drawn.

Instead of perhaps showing the more serious side of kids with cancer, she creates a character in Richie who pretends to be king, goes on a wild Halloween night excursion with his Uncle Phil & causes more mayhem than is typically allowable in a hospice or hospital setting. With Sylvie, we have a young woman who has an overprotective to the point of abusively, drunk father & whose one redeeming characteristic is her stubbornness & unwillingness to give up. If that were the theme presented throughout the book, then Seamon would accomplish what she set out to do, unfortunately she fails so miserably by creating a love story that which does work & then goes to an extreme to create a Hatfields & McCoys type setting in the hospital.

So I picked up the 2nd book in the Incarnations series \"Bearing an Hourglass\". After just finishing this book today, I am not sure if I want to continue onto the next story. The book starts off strong with Norton's agreeing to help out a Ghost Marriage, and finding love, but as soon as he takes over the office of Time.....well the story goes downhill. I didn't think the explanation of what Time's duties were was done very well, so we are not sure what Norton is supposed to do on a daily basis. The journey's Satan sends Norton on at the beginning have the feel of short stories that have been meshed into a larger story, but that don't really belong.

What I HAVE read, on numerous occasions, is the fabulous screenplay by Mike Rich on which it's based.<br /><br />That's right.  The book is based on a movie that was created from an original screenplay!<br /><br />While I realize that most screenwriters are unknown to the general public, it seems wrong and unfair that people might believe that the novel they are reading is the source material for the adapted movie that they love.  While that may be the standard chronology in most cases (of adaptation), there are exceptions to the rule, and this is one of them!<br /><br />FINDING FORRESTER began its life as a winning entry in the esteemed Nicholl's Fellowship screenwriting competition.  Only after it became a successful film directed by Gus van Sandt was it turned into a novel.  If you want to know more about how that process works, try reading the original screenplay and see how it served as the blueprint for what followed.<br /><br />The novel may be great in its own right.  But those ideas you so adore -- the vast majority, no doubt -- were conceived in the heart and mind of a hard-working screenwriter, difficult as that might be for some people to believe.<br /><br />Mike Rich is a tremendous writer with compassion, wit and soul.  Try watching The Rookie sometime, another screenplay he wrote that became a popular and beloved movie starring Dennis Quaid.  Or the upcoming (at this time) Secretariat, which I can only imagine will be awesome too.<br /><br />This all may seem a trivial distinction to you.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Did Not Finish", "text": "I see by glancing at some other reviews that this novel \"picks up\" later in the book.  For those of you who can make it that far, that's good news. Place me among the reviewers who found the opening confusing and relatively flat. I made it for about a 100 pages and hit my limit.<br /><br />I rarely understand the need to jump back and forth over time. To what end? I don't mind being challenged to keep track of a narrative thread, but it has to be done for good reason. It takes a special book and a special reason in the hands of a very competent author to pull this off and pull it off well. Even in those cases if I were the editor I would ask, \"why are you choosing to tell the story out of order?\"<br /><br />The additional challenge for Kushner was to build points of view through the eyes of two young children. The challenge, as always with young adults or old children, is choosing a vocabulary and awareness that truly matches that perspective. It would be helpful if it were an adult recalling what he or she thought as a young teenager, for instance, but Kushner never suggests that it's anything but the youngster's point of view.  Coupled with relatively flat and dispassionate writing, the result is a challenging narrative to swallow.  A sample: \"Maybe we should have seen it coming. It takes a while to put thing together. You can't always do it while it's happening to you. A week before the fire started, the rebels closed down the main highway east to Las Tunas. That meant they had control of Oriente, so much of which was owned by Americans. Us, and the American government, who ran the Nicaro nickel mine. Batista was persona non grata with the Cubans and we were caught in the middle. Fidel and Raul, these were local boys, and I think Daddy was hoping he could reason with them. But after the embargo on U.S. sales of military planes to Cuba, that was in March of '57, Batista put pressure on Daddy to convince John Foster Dulles--Mr. Dulles was a friend of Daddy's and a stockholder and his brother Allen was on the company's board--to find a loophole to get a sale of bombers through.\"<br /><br />I know kids are smart and put lots of information together (I've got two teenagers), but this kind of info dump back-story being told by a young person didn't connect.  I wasn't sold.<br /><br />The writing is detailed and the atmosphere is certainly evocative of Cuba, although I've never been there, but I wish the character believability and the plot matched the setting.", "images": [], "asin": "141656103X", "parent_asin": "141656103X", "user_id": "AEYFCXNFRVL5ISYTH7AO2CZH4WZQ", "timestamp": 1230406896000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Random action, unlikeable characters, never gets to the point...", "text": "The biggest fault I had with this book was that it took almost the entire 500+ pages to truly (I think) start the story.  The rest is about the meanderings (well ok, battle filled meanderings) of characters from a wide variety of areas.  Probably the best comparison I can make is with \"Fellowship of the Ring\" by Tolkien.  Both books involve a quest that is a major turning point in the characters' lives and the world (I assume so anyhow for \"The First Law\" series, not having read the latter two books).  But whereas \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" places the start of the quest relatively early but after a buildup which makes the necessity and gravity of the quest apparent, \"The Blade Itself\" waits til the end and the quest appears to come out of nowhere with no indication as to why it's important.<br /><br />The rest of the book comes across as a weak \"Song of Fire and Ice\" clone, with sections focusing on different characters from different political entities but none of these sections really grabbed me or made me care about what might happen to the characters.  One is a bitter, crippled torturer.  One is a pampered, spoiled, lovesick noble.  One is a barbarian well known for his abilities in battle (I'll admit, this character did provide a rather well done plot twist at one point).  One is a wizard who has an ulterior motive.  Etc... The different political factions fight against each other, but I rarely got a sense as to why certain things were done.  Battle scenes were thrown in pretty much at any opportunity.  One of the characters is training for a contest, and those scenes seem nothing more than some medieval version of \"Rocky\".<br /><br />The upshot is that for me, this novel was a slow read, punctuated by somewhat random (if reasonably well written) battle sequences, peopled by characters I couldn't empathize with, in a world with somewhat simplistic connections between the different factions, and left me just as confused as to where things were going at the end than at the beginning.<br /><br />To be clear, I don't need to be hand-held when reading.  I don't mind a bit of mystery, or surprising changes of direction.  But for a change of direction to be surprising, there has to have been another solid seeming direction beforehand, and I never got this impression when reading.<br /><br />I also didn't feel like I'd wasted my time after reading it, but it failed at its task of getting me interested enough to buy the next novel.", "images": [], "asin": "159102594X", "parent_asin": "159102594X", "user_id": "AG6ZZLTMTLBPX7M42WP2VCD32NWQ", "timestamp": 1229022261000, "helpful_vote": 28, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

What would you do if some creepy dark creature offered to eat your fears?<br /><br />* Point 2: Mmmm, cheesy clich\u00e9 filling. The entire middle section of the book is devoted more to shock value than fear factor.<br /><br />* Point 3: The end is curiosity inducing. If I didn't know better, I'd say I'd been devoured because I'm anxious to read the next installment.<br /><br />SHORT SYNOPSIS<br />When her mother ups and leaves, Regina must help take care of her younger brother Henry while their father runs his construction business. Reggie, along with her best friend Aaron, is an avid reader and horror fan. One of her rituals with Henry is to read him scary bedtime stories, the most recent of which is from the journal of a seemingly crazy woman where she talks about frightening creatures called Vours. On a lark, Reggie and Aaron decide they're going to summon a Vour. Of course, they don't really expect anything to happen, but something does--to Henry--and it's up to them to solve the mystery and save Reggie's little brother.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br />Some parts were good, and some parts were lame, but something must have been done right because I have a burning desire to read the next book.<br /><br />The story unfolded well; the process of Henry's devouring was downright chilling (that makes up the first quarter of the book). I was hoping the momentum would continue, but it petered out and the story became something straight out of a B horror movie.<br /><br />Although Henry is acting differently (like people and pets dropping dead in his presence), neither Reggie nor Aaron wonder whether he's possessed until well after any clear thinking person would have. But I was willing to forgive that.<br /><br />What I had difficulty forgiving was the gore-for-scare effect filling out the story, some of the dialogue was pure cheesy clich\u00e9, and character development left much to be desired.<br /><br />Call me jaded, but anyone who's ever watched more than a few classic horror movies would see right through it--in fact, I laughed a couple times. I truly wish it had more of the creepy ominous psychologically frightening effect displayed in the beginning (that section should not be read at night or in the dark), but if wishes were pennies, I'd be a millionaire.<br /><br />What has my panties in a bunch, though, is the fact that I really, really want to read the next book. The Devouring ended at the beginning of a bigger mystery. It's not to say that The Devouring wasn't a full story in and of itself--it was, thank goodness--but the story left me wondering: Who is Eben really? What are the Vours? And what is their ultimate plot? (Which is what a good series style book ought to do.)<br /><br />That's why this book was so difficult to rate. On one hand, a chunk of the story I would consider lame in the horror department, relying more on clich\u00e9d gore than suspenseful gore, but on the other hand, it did an amazing job of painting a larger story, piquing curiosity, and it *was* a fun read. So I'll just say this: if you're a fan of horror and have read/watched many horror novels/movies, you won't find too many surprises here, but the mystery of the Vours is great.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7gDIOwzL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7gDIOwzL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7gDIOwzL._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "031602712X", "parent_asin": "031602712X", "user_id": "AGHVMWDAR6SUDKW2DI373YCDG7NA", "timestamp": 1274413270000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

I can't recall reading any other books by Tess Mallory, and I sincerely hope this isn't an example of her other books. I plan to order another to get an idea of her style. Enough stuff, on to my opinion of the book.<br />I really thought the &quot;mechanics&quot; of the time-travel itself was interesting. A sword with a glowing green stone of unknown origin. I kept hoping Tess would develop more about this unusual sword and where it got it's power, but she just sort of drops the subject. I thought it was strange the characters weren't more curious about the sword's power. I know I would be!<br />The main character is a woman named Jix. She comes off as being immature and a bit flighty. I was really turned off by the stupid stories (read lies) she told her love interest. It really reminded me of the &quot;head games&quot; we used to play with our boyfriends in junior high! But she does see the light as the story unfolds.<br />The hunk in the story is Jamie MacGregor-or at least it was until I met the other man from the past. It occured to me that Griffin Campbell definitely had the better physical description. I had a hard time getting warm and fuzzy over Jamie. The plot...Jix and Jamie and a friend end up back in the 1600's. The friend gets separated from them first thing and we don't hear anymore about her until nearly the end of the book. During this time, Jix and Jamie are &quot;guests&quot; in a castle run by a man that wants his son married off. You guessed it. Jix must marry him, or the sword won't be returned to her. No fireworks fly between Griffin and Jix. Jamie and Jix play cat-and-mouse with thier real feelings. There is a tiny side plot where Jamie must rustle some cattle and nearly gets killed, but I never felt any real suspense. This whole story takes place in three months, but you never get any &quot;meat&quot; about what life was really like day-to-day. I missed those details.<br />Overall, I think it's mildly entertaining, but I wish I spent my money on a different book!", "images": [], "asin": "0505524449", "parent_asin": "0505524449", "user_id": "AHTMQISAR52ULJ4RN4VHCEO3EGXA", "timestamp": 999218282000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Huge Disappointment", "text": "I had read a lot of reviews on the Twilight series before finally deciding to start the first book. It was well-written for it's target audience (teens), I thought, and very entertaining for me. I found myself quickly entwined in the lives of Bella Swan and Edward Cullens. I tore through books 1 - 3 in the series and while they weren't without some flaws, they were really great reads. SO, I forked out the money for Book 4 \"Breaking Dawn\" believing that I'd be entertained beyond measure because that's when the clinchers fall like rain and surely all the bad reviews I was hearing about it were wrong since books 1 - 3 were great. Authors save the best for last, right? I was very sadly disappointed. The book starts out wonderful enough with a beautiful wedding. Then we jump to the honeymoon (which doesn't go into explicit details and keeps the reading at the intended age) and see Edward and Bella enjoying married life until something threatens their happiness - but instead of focusing on that we jump into another story. WHAT?! After I gathered my bearings, I sluggishly trudged through the most boring portion of the book. The thoughts/insights/perception of Jacob Black (\"werewolf\"). From that point on, I mostly sighed dejectedly through the book. It just seemed so hastily written that you couldn't wind your way fully into the story. Renesme could have definitely been reworked a bit to make it more believable, Jacob's imprinting shouldn't have been so ridiculously stupid, the whole \"battle\" was even more laughable - though you are happy to have certain characters still intact by the end of the book. My biggest issue was the speed in which all the changes start taking place and the huge leaps that were made to make some concepts believable. I didn't mind Bella's new found abilities at first, but then they bordered on the ridiculous towards the end.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not an heirloom recipe", "text": "I got this on the cheap, remaindered at Borders, and was in the mood for something like this. It's a quick read, has its fun moments, but it's not some fantastic book. I like the premise, that Julie Powell is feeling a bit of a life crisis: Close to age 30, feels a bit aimless in life, and decides she wants to cook all recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It looks like a fun, unusual challenge, and reading about it is enjoyable. But I'm getting tired of women who are so horrified of turning 30. Seriously, it's not such a bad thing. Thirty isn't old anymore!<br /><br />But in between you read about her government job, which she doesn't like, but what she complains about doesn't sound that horrible. Government jobs have their reputation for red tape, etc., but for someone who wanted to be an actress but for some reason never followed through and starts up a cooking blog, it's almost, why complain? Just do something about it! But I guess that's where the 'project' got started. Worst is I get the impression she doesn't even like to cook (in the book she says she started to impress the guy she ends up marrying). That's not really a passion for cooking, but just an attempt to bait a guy.<br /><br />As for the cookbook, she tackles all recipes. It seems like she did them in order, which makes no sense to me, as I think you'd want to bounce around for variety's sake. But there almost isn't enough cooking in this cooking memoir, and in between you hear about her eccentric friends, selling her eggs for money (and her fertility issue) and her supportive husband and her blog and some of the attention she gets. It's a cute, real fairy tale, but it's missing something: A little bite, a little spice.  The parts I liked best were the tidbits between the Julie chapters about Julia Child's life. I wanted more of these mini-chapters.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Emotionally unengaging, and too much unexplained to involve the reader", "text": "It's always a toss-up whether post-apocalyptic/dystopian novels will be successful at connecting with the reader's emotions. The best of them can do this, whatever the context. Unfortunately, The Wall misses the mark. It has an interesting premise, but the reader is never really engaged or given enough information about the general circumstances to feel much towards the main character or to judge his perspective.<br /><br />Kavanagh has reached the age at which every male and female serves two years as a guard on the cement barrier built around an island nation inundated by rising oceans, trying to keep out everyone else (The Others). The island appears to be England, with the station Kavanagh serves at called Ilfracombe, which today is a town on the north Devonshire coast. Hundreds of thousands serve at any one time around the perimeter of the country. It's a lonely, desolate job, with 12-hour shifts and constant cold, boredom, and fear. \"Others\" who manage to get past the Wall are usually caught quickly because they aren't chipped and are easily identified. But for every Other who makes it and isn't caught, a guard is expelled in a boat to become an Other. Kavanagh makes friends with the guards in his unit, with whom he sometimes spends his holidays (one free week each month or so), and he begins a tentative romance with one of them. The parents of this generation are routinely despised, at best, for it was on their watch that the world fell apart, and yet they elected to bring children into this new world. On the other hand, Breeders, couples who decide to get pregnant, are given special privileges so that the country won't completely fail and the Wall will always have enough guards.<br /><br />There are the makings here for a fantastic story, but it just doesn't gel. The focus is on 1) the misery of the job, 2) the fear that one will become an Other or die if there is an attack, and 3) the misery of the job (yup, the book dwells on it that much). Very little historical context is given. Kavanagh clearly knows how his country works, what's happening around the world, and what the actual apocalypse was. He just doesn't bring it up in telling his story. I would have liked an explanation of how the oceans could have risen an implied minimum of 15 or 20 feet in one generation. The older members of the society still watch TV and are addicted to movies and documentaries about how their lives were \"before\" (especially anything with scenes of beaches, which have been made impossible by the Wall). Transportation, weapons, clothing - all seems pretty much from our today. Food is limited by what currently grows in season. Innovation has largely stopped. In other ways, little has changed: the wealthy still find ways to live in luxury, paying for Help (captured Others who have chosen to become life-long servants rather than be sent back to the sea) and flying off to places around the world as they will. In other words, this is not civilization building.<br /><br />So, give it a go if you enjoy this genre, but you've been warned: you might find it wanting.", "images": [], "asin": "1324001631", "parent_asin": "1324001631", "user_id": "AHUFQMXOCVT7H7C4ICHWMKDKXFYQ", "timestamp": 1553216215473, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Not worth it.", "text": "\"Brothers In Arms\" by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton.  Subtitled \"The Epic Story Of The 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's  Forgotten Heroes\". Broadway books, New York, 2004.<br /><br />Studying History gives you exposure to the overall events of World War II, and the general ebb and flow of the European Theater of Operations, such as which unit attacked which enemy unit and the results. After an MA in History,  I am always seeking more interesting personal accounts, i.e. personal reminiscences, describing what really happened.  This book, \"Brothers In Arms\", appeared to be just that: the personal memoirs of black soldiers in a tank battalion in the EOT, with all those daily minimal details, woven into a real and personal story of the men who served.  Even more interesting, these soldiers were black.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the book did not live up to its promise.  The stories about the individuals involved, with the possible exception of  Leonard \"Smitty\" Smith, did not, in my humble opinion, bring those individuals alive.  Even the nice repetition , (but disrupting to the continuity of the book), of Baseball's Jackie Robinson's wartime experiences were not truly a personal remembrance.<br /><br />Then there are the unnecessary mistakes.  As other reviewers have mentioned the worst gaffe, the German word for panther, is \"Panther\" and \"Panzer\" means, basically,  armor or tanks.  See page 47.  The Luftwaffe's  rotund Hermann Goering is probably rotating rapidly in his grave since this book identifies him as the skinny Nazi propaganda minister.  On page 45, the authors state that  in the Pacific theater, in 1942, \"American and Japanese forces were at a stalemate\".  Sorry!  The Battle of Midway, June 1942, was the turning point and it was downhill for Japan after that. The \"stalemate\" characterization  was wrong.  On page 70, the authors have General George S. Patton being born in 1895; he was born in 1885.  Just as another example,  the book states that the German \"Teller\"  Anti-Tank mines had about one pound of explosive in them.  I could not understand why a \"Teller\" mine should threaten a Sherman tank, so I went on the Web.  There I found that the early models of the German Teller mines  had about 23 pounds, or about ten kilograms, of explosive.  I could see that this concentrated explosive force could do damage to some parts of the Sherman.  My complaint is the book's authors let this poundage gaffe go into print.<br /><br />So , for the personal memoirs, I gave four stars.  For the mistakes , (too many!) and evident lack of knowledge about the History of the EOT, I gave zero stars.  Average: two stars.", "images": [], "asin": "0385503385", "parent_asin": "0385503385", "user_id": "AGFNB7T2TJ6IS7RFQXSV4LG6UJOQ", "timestamp": 1111088447000, "helpful_vote": 18, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 3, "title": "It's always risky...", "text": "...to read the novel before seeing the film adaptation. Because usually, the comparison does the movie no favours.<br />However, as I've learned here, sometimes there's a greater risk to seeing the film first.<br /><br />As much as this is meant to be a review of the novel, the truth is that having seen the film, my view of the book is informed in so very starkly a way that I fear I cannot offer up as objective opinion as I otherwise might have.<br /><br />As a screenwriter/novelist, I'm always fascinated to see how the migration from one medium to the other is achieved, and to what extent it's successful. In the case of 'The Jane Austen Book Club', one thing was consistently apparent: the adaptation succeeded marvellously. In fact, in many ways, the film is a far more satisfying experience.<br /><br />But allow me to clarify.<br /><br />Firstly, I have no history, no relationship with Austen's novels. I've read not a one. So clearly, what Fowler waves through her story Austen-wise, was lost on me. Not that I couldn't appreciate that she was clearly a lover of Austen's works and had fashioned a tale as an homage to the writer. I'm sure that a fan of Austen's books would have added many a satisfaction-point onto their final score. But I suppose what struck me most in this sense was the fact that the movie seemed to do a far better job of utilizing the themes and characters than the novel does.<br /><br />Secondly, while the film is focused, the novel is...well, a lot more of a riff. And perhaps this can be chalked up mostly to the narrator's voice. In the film, it's a typical 'third-person omniscient'. In the book- Well, I still can't figure out why Fowler decided to tell it in first-person omniscient...and then, never really declare that it's being told by Bernadette. In fact, I don't know why she chose to use the narrative voice she did, at all. It makes no sense...first-person cannot be omniscient when we're talking about the narrator having access to information they'd not have access to...and in the end, came off as contrived. In fact, to a certain extent, it ruined the book for me.<br /><br />Finally, the film, while not utilizing much of the novel's narrative, uses what it does explore much better than the book. In fact, maybe this was what surprised me most, that the movie is much more cohesive, does a far better job at delving into characters...it makes more sense. These criticisms are usually made about the film, not the source material, hence my surprise.<br /><br />The novel is lovely. A little scattered, a little idiosyncratic, but with some enchanting touches. (Having read the book, I can attest to the fact that the movie missed some opportunities...but the writer/director should be proud of what she accomplished.) I wouldn't glow about it the way some of the jacket blurbs did...but then I'm not an Austen-ite...and I'm not a woman.<br /><br />I'd like to think that Jane would forgive me both.", "images": [], "asin": "B000X7CN64", "parent_asin": "0399151613", "user_id": "AHYQADUEQJRRSQK6F7YQ6EES4VTQ", "timestamp": 1235777532000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 1, "title": "'Unspoken Truth' Review [MINOR SPOILERS]", "text": "I've come across more than a few reviews of this book online, and the one gleaming review posted on Amazon at the time of this posting. The reviews have really lauded this book as great, a must-read, wonderful ... but the book I read is anything but. It is horribly dull, contrived and just a step above fan-fiction that you could Google and get online. I've read both [[ASIN:0743464079 Catalyst of Sorrows (Star Trek: The Lost Era, 2360)]] and [[ASIN:0743496930 Burning Dreams (Star Trek)]], both by Margaret Wander Bonanno, and both dealing with unanswered questions from the 'Original Series' era. In brief, 'Unspoken Truth' is supposed to do for the character of Saavik what 'Burning Dreams' did for Captain Pike: give a underused character in Trek lore his/her moment in the spotlight and reveal new and interesting things about them that the tv series and movies left untouched. I was disappointed to say that 'Unspoken Truth' really is a bust and dropped the ball when it comes to doing justice for the character of Saavik. Perhaps it missteps in trying to insert the character into one of the most unoriginal plots one could think of: the heroine is pushed to her limits and is lost emotionally after traumatizing events and extreme circumstances (Star Trek: Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock and The Voyage Home). As a result, she reflects on her past and is recruited by the 'enemy' to ruin her mentor, Sarek's, career. Now, 'Burning Dreams' and 'Catalyst of Sorrows' both worked well because their plots didn't involve an outcome we were too sure about. We all know from other Trek movies, shows and books that Sarek lived a long life and his career never suffered a setback as this book tries to hint at. Thus, the reader is treated to a long, drawn out novel that at the end feels very predictable, contrived and horribly executed.<br /><br />The Good: The only good I have to say about this novel is that I enjoyed the scenes that filled-in between the movies. We're treated to what could be considered 'cut' or bonus scenes from Star Trek: The Search for Spock and Star Trek: The Voyage Home. Kirk worrying about Spock returning to his old self after the events of Star Trek: The Search for Spock and Voyage Home was actually entertaining, as was McCoy's few appearances. Another character that seemed to get a lot of great scenes was Amanda, who is seen and portrayed more as a mother in this novel than as a wife as she usually is in most novels. Beyond these two areas, there's not much to praise.<br /><br />The Bad: Where to begin. I feel 'Unspoken Truth' is guilty of really confusing and giving the character of Saavik a makeover when none was necessary. Compared to what was shown in the movies and what was written about Saavik in other novels, this one turns her into a rebellious teen with unchecked emotional problems, lacking common sense and devoid of logic. Basically, gone is the Saavik of the movies and in her place is a character from some 1980s brat pack movie. Every sentence that Saavik thinks or says seems to end with an exclamation point as if she is forever mad or on edge. This book (to my knowledge) rewrites her character's history a bit to make it so that she was found by Spock as a young child, brought home, raised by Sarek and Amanda, mentored by 'big brother' Spock ... and I'm sorry, but the author does nothing to make any of this, or Saavik's relationship with any of the characters, believable. Part of this problem is that there are two plots going on within this book that hardly go together and so both end up being short-changed. The plot described on the back of the book ... sorry to reveal that it doesn't even occur until page 209 at which point it's rushed and pushed through and never fully developed. The majority of the book deals with Saavik seeking a quiet, un-eventful mission following the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. That's exactly what she gets and what the reader must sit through and endure. The first 200 pages of this novel are for the most part a total bore. Then comes the Romulan plot to recruit Saavik to ruin Sarek's career. It's contrived, predictable and meanders without any true focus. A couple of pages in, you're able to guess the outcome at every twist and turn. Annoyingly, 'unspoken truth' appears in the dialogue various times but I must say by the end, I have no idea what the author was trying to refer to or get at with the title. The end of the novel ends with dialogue that made this feel like 'The Little Mermaid' made-over for Star Trek: Father-figure Sarek realizes he can't force Vulcan tradition on his daughter Saavik and that he and Amanda have raised her to the best of their ability and must let her go off into the vast universe on her own. Seriously.<br /><br />Let me not forget to mention that Saavik also finds a new love in this novel and behaves like a promiscuous teenager in heat, at once jumping into bed and a complicated relationship with her new guy ... even after pages of her agonizing over how mating with Spock in Star Trek: The Search for Spock was unwise and complicated her life and brought her much grief and personal shame. So, again, what in the world? I don't understand why so many readers are jumping for joy over this book when it's nothing more than a harlequin romance novel set in the Star Trek universe. This book is pretty much character assassination for the character of Saavik. It doesn't do anything to make her any more clear, likable or smart/intelligent as she was portrayed in the films and in other books. It was as if someone gave Bonanno free range to do as she pleased with the character(s) (because not even Sarek or Spock feel totally in character). On an entirely different note, was this the absolute best cover Pocket Books could come up with because it seems like a pretty lame cop-out for doing something more representative of the events of the novel. I guess this is supposed to be Vulcan, perhaps Sarek's residence ... whatever the case, it's never explained or linked to the events of the novel. Could they not have, I don't know, put an image of Saavik on the cover since the novel is about her?<br /><br />Avoid this book. I rarely give out 1 star reviews but this was by far the worst book I've read in a long time. It's dull, the first 200 pages have nothing at all to do with the book's description and even that plot is dull, lacking and poorly written. I expected a lot more from the author who has written some great novels but as said, this book certainly isn't one of them. The author managed to turn one of Trek's most interesting characters into nothing more than a cardboard cut-out from an adolescent novel. The plot does not feel original and is planted in the middle of a time period and dealing with characters whose outcomes we're aware of and thus can easily predict the outcome of the book, making reading this horrible mess of a novel pretty much wasted money and paper. The novel ends with Saavik pretty much where she was when the novel began and looking forward to getting back to duty and returning to the Enterprise if Kirk and crew will have her. Uh, we all saw Star Trek IV: The Final Frontier and the films that followed so yet again, we know the outcome of that event. This novel was, in my opinion, a missed opportunity. I'd rather have been treated to a novel that filled in a piece of Star Trek history that hasn't been covered to death and was unknown to the reader so that reading it would have created more history. Perhaps having focused on Saavik post Original Series movie era, or even before she came into the picture and really explored her alone, not attached to Spock or Sarek, would have improved the novel. Whatever the case, I can't in good conscience recommend this novel to anyone.

Well, first of all, the American people are hardly anticapitalist. Unless you are a fanatical Randian, you can hardly say that the administrations the American people have elected throughout US history have been anticapitalist. But is true that Americans have become more suspicious of unbridled capitalism. They realize that capitalism is very good at creating wealth, but that is also very good at destroying the social networks that have served mankind quite well through evolutionary times. After all, man is a social animal (unless you want to argue, like Margaret Thatcher, that there is no society, just individuals). Same for free trade. It might bring cheaper goods for the consumers, but it also destroys the manufacturing base of the country.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Ms. Evanovich Please Let Stephanie Grow Up", "text": "Ten Big Ones is not a bad book.  The reader gets introduced to Ranger's hideout (the Rangeman facility) and his apartment on the 7th floor.  Now THAT is fun because who doesn't want to know more about Ranger!  In this book Ranger still maintains that sultry classiness which makes him desirable (the classiness which he loses in book 17 when he is brought down to Stephanie's low class level).  In this book he remains an enigma.  Which is what makes his character so interesting.  We also get to see a faint glimpse of independence in the Stephanie Plum character.  A tiny bit of feminism that her character is almost always completely lacking.  Unfortunately, just as soon as we glimpse it, the author yanks it away.  Stephanie Plum isn't amusing as much as she is cringe worthy.  Which makes me sad.  I would like for Stephanie Plum to be more of a hero.  I would like her to be deserving of Morelli or Ranger.  Ten Big Ones starts out with the worn out rehash of the \"car incident\" (with a car always being spray painted, blown up or catching on fire).  The rest of the book is Stephanie making the usual questionable and even stupid decisions, Stephanie and Lula driving all around Trenton, Stephanie's life being threatened and Stephanie having to be rescued, blah blah blah.  The \"mystery\" factors are always weak and it's the same with book 10.  There is the usual page after endless page of (fattening) food descriptions.  At least in this book the author gets honest and admits the truth about the main character.  Stephanie is asked multiple times if she's pregnant.  Stephanie herself comments on how disgusted she is with her own body. There is nothing sexy about Stephanie Plum. The author asking readers to believe that either Morelli or Ranger would ever look twice at Stephanie as a potential romantic or sexual partner is really pushing the borders of fantasy.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Descending order of good", "text": "When I bought this book, I did so because I like the concept of space marines.  I did not know it was a Warhammer40k tie in, and I knew nothing about the game's universe.  When I realized what I had bought, I figured I'd give it a shot anyway.<br /><br />The leading short story is pretty good.  It's actually a pretty classic senario of small force fighting off a greater.  Quite a bit of it comes off as over the top, like how thirty men fought off hundreds over many hours.  Not great, but a good set up for the characters and their basic motivations.<br /><br />The first book, \"Nightbringer\", surprised me.  The political intrigue around the attempted raising of a sleeping being of ancient powers worked quite well for me.  I thought that the characters worked well and the interactions were believable.  I was quite pleased, actually.  But this is the best of the three books contained in this omnibus.<br /><br />The second book, \"Warriors of Ultamar\", was more of a straight \"blow everything up and move towards a goal\" story.  There was some small intrigue and several new characters, but they both seemed flat and stale.  One group of minor characters, a selfish street gang, never showed any development at all over the story which begged the question why they were included at all.  This is not a horrible book, and the alien menace is quite clever, but it isn't something that would bring me back.<br /><br />The third book, \"Dead Sky, Black Sun\", was the same sort of linear tale as the second one, but just nasty.  On the \"Eye of Terror\", an outcast planet of horrors, the author unleashes all the disgust of a bad splatter movie.  I felt queasy reading parts of it and the plot didn't help distract from the gore.  At times, this book was just a protracted bloodbath of nastiness.  The characters became even more flat, right down to the recycled dialog from \"Star Wars\".  It ends with a touch of cliffhanger, one that I will never have resolved as I plan to read no more of these works.<br /><br />The first book is worth reading, wheather you are interested in the game or not.  The second is poor, but definitly for the gamers.  And avoid the third.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Stereotyping College Life", "text": "This book is about the corruption of a young American girl from Sparta, a remote mountain town in North Carolina, who makes it against all odds to a top university in Pennsylvania (\"Dupont\"), only to find out that not top-notch education but rather sex, alcohol, drugs and generlly being \"cool\" are top-most on her fellow students' minds. Tom Wolfe paints a vivid picture of college life on American campuses, or at least that's what he would have us believe, not too successfully in my mind.<br /><br />I guess Wolfe was out to write the definitive book about college life. And indeed the book is nothing but a long (700+ pages) description of the frivolities of college students. It is full of stereotypical characters: the basketball players who get academic discounts and lead a life (literally) above the rest, the drunken frat boys and the giggly sorority girls, the group of smart nerds who are after the Rhodes scholarship and, above all, the innocent hillybilly who cannot believe it all - Charlotte. Wolfe, in his charcteristic style, does not leave much to the imagination when describing Charlotte's encounter with college life. One of ther first experiences on campus are the sounds produced by a boy defecating loudly in the stalls of the co-ed bathroom (I will spare you the details). Shortly thereafter, Charlotte's room-mate throws her out in the middle of the night so that she can spend time there alone with her boyfriend; thus Charlotte learns what it means to be \"sexiled\". And so on and so forth.<br /><br />Despite its weakness in credibility - I refuse to believe this is what life in Ivy League colleges is all about - what saves this book is Wolfe's excellent writing style, captivating the reader and transporting him to a world that although removed from reality seems at the same time very realistic. I read the book while travelling between three continents and it was a faithful companion on the long flights and sleepless nights. As far as pop fiction goes, it's an entertaining read.<br /><br />One final thought. Wolfe, author of excellent books such as Bonfire of Vanities and A Man in Full, gives thanks in the foreward to the book to his daughters, who apparently let him into the secret lives of college students based on first-hand experiences. If I am Charlotte Simmons faithfully portrays what Wolfe's daughters went through in college, I shudder to think how he reacted, as a father, when hearing their stories.", "images": [], "asin": "0312424442", "parent_asin": "0312424442", "user_id": "AFB74PLDJXKWLXPWZOYZNGFDCGVQ", "timestamp": 1237192522000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Falls Short", "text": "I'm just not sure what Dan Fesperman was aiming for in his novel, &#34;The Prisoner of Guantanamo;&#34; a thriller, a character study of GITMO and its prisoners, the watchers and the watched, a comment on moral ambiguity, all the above? Whatever Fesperman was aiming for, it gets lost in the translation, as if written originally in Arabic and translated by someone for whom the language was as difficult as the culture from whence it comes.<br /><br />I will say that the novel is interesting in its portrayal of GITMO and its environs, interrogators, security personnel, and inmates, but one would be better served by using the Internet to research the prison, its operation, and culture, as long as one does due diligence on the authors and their motives. For example, Gordon Cucullu has written a non-fiction book on GITMO that's very detailed in its description of the place, but quite biased in its treatment of the operation and culture. Joseph Margulies' book covers the establishment of GITMO and its legal precedents and implications. Using the search term on the ProPublica web site will produce numerous stories covering everything from imprisonment at GITMO to trial of GITMO prisoners. The point is, if you're looking for details on GITMO and its prisoners, fiction, even by someone as presumably well-informed as Fesperman, isn't the place to get it.<br /><br />So, that brings us back to book as a representative of the &#34;thriller&#34; genre. Here too, the book falls short. Fesperman builds up slowly to a denouement that never really materializes in any sensible or even satisfying manner. The buildup is slow enough that what seem extraneous &#34;adventures&#34; (scenes) are interjected in an attempt to maintain reader interest. To some extent they do, only to let the reader down even harder at the conclusion.<br /><br />It's my belief that Fesperman never really had a final revelation in mind when he started writing the book, and when he finally got to the final chapter and epilogue he, his protagonist, Revere Falk, and the rest of us were left wondering, &#34;What was the point?&#34;", "images": [], "asin": "1400096146", "parent_asin": "1400096146", "user_id": "AGVXKM7RQQTKUOY6B4J6VAHAFETQ", "timestamp": 1361129686000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 1, "title": "Pictures at confusing for teaching the alphabet", "text": "The choice of words used to depict each letter of the alphabet is downright confusing! For example for &#34;I&#34; the page says &#34;I is for ink, that makes my hands blue&#34; and has a picture of a girl holding her hands up and the hands are blue. The issue I have with this is majority of the picture is of the girl's body. So my toddler looks at the picture and says &#34;girl&#34; or points to the body parts and names the body parts. This book is supposed to help teach each letter- why would they choose ink?! There is nothing distinctive about the coloring to even make you think it is &#34;ink&#34;... In fact I covered the sentence describing the letter and asked 5 people what they thought this was a picture of and what letter they thought it was for. All 5 people said &#34;H for hands&#34; which proves my point that using &#34;ink&#34; for the letter &#34;I&#34; was a poor choice. This happens again for &#34;Q&#34;. The sentence chosen to describe &#34;Q&#34; is: &#34;Q is for quiet as the tired puppy sleeps&#34; and it shows a large picture of a dog sleeping. So now my toddler gets to Q and says &#34;dog!&#34; & this is frustrating as I have to teach her that dog is not spelled with a Q. This happens again with &#34;w&#34; described as &#34;W is for wet, when you're splashing around.&#34; While this photo shows a boy with bubbles on him, it doesn't even show water! Once again I asked people what they thought this picture could be for and they said either B for Boy or B for bubble. This is very counter-productive for a parent!! We should have books that are helpful for younger toddlers, not confusing!! even the seemingly simpler pictures, P for piglet or D for duckling.. Why not choose pig or duck? I understand that they chose the correct names (it is a baby duck, so they call it duckling), but for the sake of word association just use a picture of an adult duck. A 15 month old isn't going to be able to comprehend duckling vs duck and it only confuses the child! Lastly, they have odd choices for the sensory portion. For K they choose a kitten playing with a ball of yarn. The cut out has access to the yarn for the child to touch. Wouldn't it make more sense to put a cut out to the fur? So the child associates touching soft fur of the kitten for K? Not yarn...?<br /><br />To the author/publishing company- please change the Q page to Queen. I page to iguana or ice.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Part fascinating, part disheartening", "text": "I knew little about Cilla Black until I saw a television account of her life and realized she was from Liverpool and rose to fame during the height of Beatlemania. And that\u2019s when I purchased her autobiography Cilla Black: What\u2019s It All About? I was truly fascinated by the \u201cinsider\u201d information about the Beatles and the other groups of the time, among them Gerry and the Pacemakers and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. I loved her descriptions of her close friendships with John, Paul, Ringo and George, especially with Ringo who became a very close friend. She signed with the Beatles\u2019s manager Brian Epstein, and her description of him, their friendship, and her devastation at his death were heartening and entertaining. I loved her telling of how she maintained close friendships with her mates from younger years, especially with her childhood friend Pat Davies and Cynthia Lennon, mother of Julian Lennon and first wife of John Lennon. The book is mostly a seemingly heartfelt tribute, rather than a \u201cdish the dirt\u201d memoir. I, not being British nor having lived in England, was surprised that not only did Black achieve the status of the best-selling female vocalist in her country, but also she became a beloved television personality, hosting several long-term shows. So what just is it that turned me off somewhat to this woman? She wants us to believe she is a still a \u201chometown girl\u201d Liverpudlian at heart, simple and true to her upbringing. That may very well be true. But today the woman is a multi-millionaire, and while many celebrities seem to not flaunt that and live quiet lives, Black is so proud of it that she writes of her estate in England, her villa in Spain, and her apartment in Barbados as if we all have the opportunity to own such (or at least care deeply about her comfort.) Furthermore, she seems to want to refute every little gaff she made in her career as an \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way\u201d moment or \u201cthe press misunderstood.\u201d She seems intent, in this book, to whitewash every error she has made in her very public life, when perhaps it would have been best to ignore the tarnish on her silver celebrity status, letting it fade into the history that one forgets. And when she, at the end, lest us know she is on a quest for a perfect pink diamond, one that will cost her well over a million dollars, because she deserves a trinket of that magnitude, I felt like there is no way this boastful wealthy woman has any of her humble Liverpudlian qualities still intact. She just wants us to think that, counting on her adoring fans to say, \u201cWell, we love her and want her to be happy.\u201d She doesn\u2019t dwell on her charitable activities, although she does mention them, but I have to wonder how much that excess-of-a-million dollars would buy if it were channeled into food for the hungry rather than a bauble for her finger.", "images": [], "asin": "0091890357", "parent_asin": "0091890357", "user_id": "AEZEFRB2AQ2EXQ3ZKPLAB7SSL6QA", "timestamp": 1636915003358, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

But that's where the kudos stop.<br /><br />Book is full of errors, questions are vague or weak (but they are that way on the real exam, too). The book constantly repeated itself on many topics and missed lots of material. It was easy to see that the authors and reviewers did not review each other's work. There was some wrong technical information, especially around the crypto section. Many things the book went over heavily, and repeated through several chapters, were not on the exam (e.g. TCP/IP model, project management, etc.).<br /><br />Even their review of the TCP/IP model was wrong. The book constantly referred to the five layers of the model, and the model only has 4 layers.<br /><br />Yes, several of the book's test answers have the incorrect answer choice (as other reviewers have noted), but even worse, often the answer explanation didn't explain the correct answer. Most exam cram type books do poorly on the test questions, and this book was no different.<br /><br />Overall, I think the book only prepared me for about 1/10th of the questions presented on the CISA exam. I was scoring 85-95% on the book questions and rarely guessing, but on the exam I was guessing a lot more (80% of the time). I probably passed (I do well on most exams and I've got about 50 other certifications), but it would have been nice to have been spoon fed the possible questions better.<br /><br />But the real CISA exam is very weird, and like a lot of the other crappy security exams, one book will never prepare, so buy and study at least two.<br /><br />I did not regret buying this book, and I'll lend it to friends.

{"rating": 1, "title": "All about ordinary guy Joe and little about McCarthy -- or McCathyism", "text": "It is too easy to knock this book, and it is a failure. This is a shame, since the author does a decent job of laying out his story, presenting the sequence of events in a turbulent period and avoiding stereotyping McCarthy as either extreme villain or underappreciated hero. He has obviously worked hard to find the right pitch and tone for his juvenile audience. The writing is crisp and clear.<br /><br />But......<br /><br />The choice of his \"Joe\" perspective and the treating of him as just one of the guys is a major misjudgment. I assume he wanted to avoid the type of demonization so marvelously captured in Richard Condon's novel The Manchurian Candidate, which is gloriously over the top, and the magnificent film version directed by John Frankenheimer, starring a superb Frank Sinatra and even more superb Angela Lansbury. He also tries not to be unfair (I choose the double negative here, because he omits assessment rather than makes conclusions) about the underlying concerns of the Red-baiters and HUAC that McCarthy exploited. (Truth in reviewing; I personally regard them as corrupt, shabby, vicious, mendacious, opportunistic, and devoid of scruple - words that I would apply to McCarthy.)<br /><br />Rather than intrude my own views of the content, here are just a few short quotes from the book that you can use to judge for yourself the likelihood of your getting much insight from reading it. \"This was not the first time... Joe was criticized for mistaking facts.\" \"Joe anxiously awaited the results of the [tax] audit.... He was elated [he got a $1,00 refund].... Joe wasn't content to let the matter end there, however.\" He \"loved to get revenge when he felt someone had treated him unjustly.\" Re Roy Cohn, of whom little good has ever been said and surely was about as vile a person as could be \"I couldn't care less about your politics. I'm only interested in your ability to do the job.\" \"He was also surprised and saddened he would not be welcome [to many Republican leaders] in their local elections in the fall.\" This last remark is about the impact of the Army hearings!<br /><br />The author skips any in-depth discussion of the substance of the political background. That's understandable in trying to write a short book targeted to high schoolers. But there's no texture and key aspects of McCarthy's behavior are skimmed over. Nixon is mentioned only in passing. Roy gets a free pass. Towards the end, his \"drinking heavily\" is mentioned, but in passing. From all accounts, this was a sodden drunk. His motivations are not questioned. His vilification and persecutions of defenseless government and academic individuals are not explained or adequately detailed. While the author lays out facts accurately, they are never fleshed out or put in context. Watch any film or TV presentation of he hearings and the great Ed Murrow counterattack that become McCarthy's fall; the passion, anger, aggression and jousting of the many power players and the sheer drama are so far from the blandness of \"then this happened.... Joe felt saddened.\"<br /><br />I rate this a one-star book, more for what it is not than what it is. It is a workmanlike work (with interesting photos).

{"rating": 3, "title": "A steampunk story by the modern master of robot stories.", "text": "If there's anything Daniel H. WilsonDaniel H. Wilson is good at, it's writing about robots. In his latest book, The Clockwork Dynasty, he takes a steampunk approach by setting the book, not in the future, but in the present and distant past. Returning to the origins of robots via the automatons created for the entertainment of the wealthy and royal, Wilson has crafted another workable piece of fiction centered on robots. Unfortunately, as is the case with some of this other writing, I didn't like a few of his stylistic choices.<br /><br />The Clockwork Dynasty jumps back and forth between flashbacks and &#34;present era&#34; actions, which can sometimes be distracting, especially if one of the storylines is particularly interesting at the time. I almost wonder if there could have been a better way to focus on the action in the present and to reveal the details of the past in more of a &#34;show&#34; instead of the &#34;tell&#34; provided via flashbacks. Additionally, I get why some of the violence was present in this book, but it (along with the few moments of obscenity or sex) seemed a little unnecessary.<br /><br />One of my other qualms with this book was with the audiobook itself. Since the individuals reading each of the sections were different between the past and the present, it did help to know where I was in the story. However, the male voice of the past was a little quieter than the female voice of the present. This meant I turned up the volume each time the story was in a flashback, only to scramble to turn it down when the timeframe switched. Some volume leveling would have made this book a little less difficult to listen to, is all I'm saying.<br /><br />A steampunk story by the modern master of robot stories, I give The Clockwork Dynasty 3.0 stars out of 5.", "images": [], "asin": "B06XNZC2C2", "parent_asin": "B06XNZC2C2", "user_id": "AEPKTKAUAD3ZVLH4NEGWTLQJGV6Q", "timestamp": 1524338448217, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

I mean seriously they wandered around and just sort of happened upon things that started to make sense within the case. Leaphorn was more worried about his wife (rightfully so) then he was about actually catching a murderer on the reservation. Chee felt like that only truly intelligent character and yet very little time felt like it was spent on him as a police officer. The pacing was so slow I actively went out of my way to find other things to do rather then read. I almost had to bribe myself to even finish 15 pages a night so I could finish the book before my book club met up to discuss it.<br /><br />Of the entire 216 pages only the last 25 or so were actually something I enjoyed. I only enjoyed the last 10% of the book because it was the only part where things actually happened and the \"police\" (I use that term very loosely in this as they were mostly just lucky and not actually good at their jobs) managed to mostly figure out what was going on. We won't talk about the fact that they weren't even the ones to take down the bad guy because that just felt like a low blow from the author. We also won't discuss the fact that said bad guy was mentioned a total of around 10 by name. We met the person once and then BOOM, the bomb is dropped that they are the bad guy. Where did that even come from?<br /><br />Westerns are definitely not my favorite thing, be them movies or books, so this was already starting off not well.

It is a high D or low C on a grading scale, for me.  I don't particularly find Dan Torrence\u2019s adult story engaging; it is really just kind of boring. Dan has his life struggles, most of which have resulted from his father's alcoholism and Overlook possession-there are lots of personal internal and external conflicts and demons Dan needs to trap, yet he is a boring guy, so the story is not too engaging in the first half of the story.<br /><br />OK, time for some MILD SPOILERS: Additionally, I didn\u2019t find the antagonists (the True Knot) really menacing/threatening (I kind of envision them as a band of roving decaying circus vampires); King made the heroine too strong for the True Knot. The situations and conflicts created by the True Knot should be suspenseful, but I never felt tension with the telepathic battles. Many times,  I just wanted the story to be over, faster.

His recent work though leaves me baffled. There's so much potential with the Ancient Shores universe that this should have been one heck of a story. However, what was delivered was a random meandering story with no central plot. The character just kinda show up at the roundhouse, explore something, nothing exciting happens, and they come back home. Rinse and repeat. The administration of the roundhouse seems somewhat implausible for an artifact of such interest to humanity, to be sending out missions haphazardly with what appear to be unqualified characters and unclear goals. Security is terrible. A significant portion of the book is characters whining about how the roundhouse presents a threat rather than an opportunity. It's like McDevitt is giving the middle finger to the work that he created. I'm genuinely puzzled why this thing turned out the way it did.

But recently, the federal government and many of the states have adopted the SAFE Act, which limits your ability to sell with financing unless a couple of things. One of them is that you actually lived in the property that you're selling, then you can sell it. But with a Lonnie Deal, that's not going to work out. The other criteria is that you go through a mortgage broker and that they actually take the application for the buyer...and they might want you to close in a title company.  And when you're talking about as few dollars as are involved in these Lonnie Deals...there's really not a whole bunch of extra money floating around in a Lonnie Deal to be able to hire all these extra people to comply with the SAFE Act.&#34;<br />Well thanks for letting me buy your book and read 200 pages before letting me know that doing a Lonnie Deal today is unworkable.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Great idea, poor execution", "text": "I received this book from the LibraryThing.com Member Giveaway.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. The book summary sounded intriguing: a story about an ancient Celtic treasure in the time before the Arthurian legends. The author's note indicated that the book had been painstakingly researched, even though it was fiction. I usually LOVE this type of book - right up my alley! However, the language of the book detracted so much from the story that it was laborious to read. The writing was, at times, stilted, other times, just awkward. At times, I felt I was reading a book that had been written in another language and then poorly translated to English. Other times, it just felt like there had been little effort in the editing - grammatically, there were split infinitives, sentences ending with prepositions, subject/noun agreement, and distracting passive voice. Typographically, there were distracting misspellings (for example: 'dessert' instead of 'desert' and the non-word, \"drunkened\" as in (p237) \"...drunkened with the sensuous craving....\").<br /><br />Some of what bothered me may have been mere stylistic choice - I am not fond of the overuse of inanimate objects taking actions - throughout the book, faces hovered, swords launched, daggers propelled, and on p192 a \"thump bounced around inside the house and they turned towards it.\" Other descriptive terms were awkward, as well - there was a description of a \"tender thud\", and while I understand that there are many authors that use the phrases, \"he embraced her to him\" and \"he curled his mouth\" turn me off. Also, every other expression of good humor was described as \"light\" - the characters laugh lightly, chuckle lightly, smile lightly - I think once, someone even frowned lightly. Sometimes it just felt like the wrong word was chosen from the thesaurus.<br /><br />The story itself was rather entertaining, however I figured out the male lead's secret about 1/3 of the way through the book and spent the rest of the book wondering why the female lead was so dense. I felt the book did not have much in the way of character development, and I did not feel drawn to any of the characters.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Tedious Account of Boston Mob Boss' Trial", "text": "As author T.J. English observes in the Introduction, WHERE THE BODIES WERE BURIED is \"an account of the trial of Whitey Bulger from a particular point of view.\"  That point of view is, basically, outrage against the government law enforcement system that recruited a notorious Boston mob boss like Bulger as a \"Top Echelon\" informant, and protected him from prosecution for many years, despite his ongoing criminal activities (including murders, sex with underage girls, drug trafficking, and racketeering).<br /><br />English \"attended every minute and every day of the trial,\" and recounts the daily events in detail, in chronological order.  Thus he successfully captures the tedium of every long criminal trial.  The author's desire to see the full scandal of the FBI's unfortunate involvement with Bulger \"laid bare\" is admirable, but the scandal itself isn't all that interesting if you haven't heard of Bulger and his crimes before picking up this book.<br /><br />WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED represents a lot of research (through interviews with witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and former federal agents), and is reasonably well-written.  However, as one more reporter's eyewitness account of a famous criminal trial, it's boring.  Those who are already familiar with the Boston gangster's crimes will probably find it more interesting than I did.

Her father, Gabriel, contemptuous and terrifying. When she's 18, Meridia meets Daniel, and the love is instant. Against the wishes of her father and his mother, they marry. His mother, Eva, is a harridan. Meridia and Daniel spend a great deal of energy trying to deflect, ignore and postpone Eva's rages.<br /><br />The difference, in \"Of Bees and Mist\", is that their world has more magic than ours, for good and ill. Not wave-your-wand magic, but mists that make you disappear, coincidences that pop like firecrackers, happiness that turns you into a ghost. And most of all - the bees. This imagery is riveting: When Eva wants her way, she needles and shouts and sends her bees. They surround you, sting you, enter your ears and your mouth, all the while furiously buzzing - stinging your mind as well as your body.<br /><br />The bees imagery is what saves this book. As a metaphor for the cruelty of unmitigated and virulent nagging, it is brilliant.<br /><br />What leads me to give \"Of Bees and Mist\" 3.2 stars, rounded down to 3, is that it is 404 pages of repetition. What new evil can Eva devise? What new subterfuge can Meridia propose. Who will be the next to wilt and rot? Rather like the joke about soap operas; you can miss two weeks or two chapters and find nothing has changed.<br /><br />If the writing style had been more lyrical, my interest may not have waned so thoroughly, as I could have gotten lost in beautiful words. But, though competent, Setiwan's prose is prosaic. The one turn of phrase that caught me was, not surprisingly, about Eva, the most interesting character, even as she repels:<br />\"Like beads on a necklace, Eva strung one snub after another, waiting for the right time to exact her payment from Permony.\"<br /><br />\"Of Bees and Mist\" is described on the book cover as \"magic realism\".

Instead of explicating the poem carefully Mr Bloom spouts out Platonic philosophy, failing of course to connect it to the poem itself.  Because, you see, a close consideration of Stevens' poetry is not Bloom's goal.  He's been writing the same book under different titles since the 1970s.  He's lost in his own hall of mirrors narcissitically aping himself.<br />  Anyone wishing for a fine book on Stevens' should hunt down the two texts by Helen Vendler, a critic whose only agenda is to bring the meaning of the poetry to light.", "images": [], "asin": "0801491851", "parent_asin": "0801491851", "user_id": "AGK4KDBBHQ4Q4M7CD6YRAF3CCQWA", "timestamp": 1397666463000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

Like some of the reviewers, I too feel that the illustrations could have been better (they are kind of colorful but could have been cuter, with more fall colors while showing that season), and I also feel that apart from being very informative, the language could have been more engaging to read. I reduced the 2 stars for the average illustrations and the bland writing style, still worth a buy if you find it cheap(used copies), for the wealth of information it gives within the simple story.

If you're looking to be carried along by silken prose, you'd be better served looking elsewhere.<br /><br />What I liked about the book: lots of information.  I enjoyed reading about a cowboy's relationship with his horse, and reading actual examples of tombstone inscriptions that were placed on those few horses that made such an impact in life that in death they deserved not only burial but a marker with an inscription.  I enjoyed reading the story about the traveler at the train depot hearing good news, and how a nearby group of cowboys - upon overhearing the man's good news - suddenly raised a ruckus simply to help the man celebrate.  I enjoyed reading how important a cowboy's hat and saddle were, the detailed descriptions of his gear, his gait, and the physical deformities he suffered from a lifetime riding a horse - even riding a horse, rather than walking, when no more than 200 yards separated the cowboy from his destination.<br /><br />What I did not like about the book: Most of it reads like this (or worse): \"Associated with these men, obedient to their leadership, taking color from them, and so also a factor in formulating the social and political system of the Range were such of the cowboy's fellow employees as, not being cowboys, were therefore of a station more humble than he was.\"  Sentences are unnecessarily cumbersome, and frequently I had to stop and re-read sentences or entire paragraphs in order to get it.  I understand the book was written 80 years ago, but I'm not accustomed to reading this style of writing.  The author also used quotes excessively.  He often made sentences using the words of the time, but he quoted every word which I found very distracting being that it occurred page after page, chapter after chapter.  In addition, there's no story here, no evolution of learning, no sense of being carried through time or of having a picture of cowboy life magically painted before your eyes.  It read more like a shopping list: Cowboy gear was: item 1, item 2, item 3.  Cowboy personality was: item 1, item 2, item 3.

{"rating": 3, "title": "3 1/2 Stars - Hit and Miss", "text": "Hit and Miss<br /><br />I went into this book as a player of SWTOR and a fan of the lore. I had modest expectations and in some ways it greatly surpassed them while in others it fell short. I'd like to start with the strongest point of the book though, the main character, Theron Shan.<br /><br />Theron is a rather interesting main character and he has a unique perspective on the things that take place around him. He has history with the Jedi even though he isn't a force user himself and is knowledgable on their beliefs and practices though he doesnt follow them. Theron displays this by often going from cynical and indulgent about things such as the force to naive and idealistic on matters of state and the war. That being said, this is such a good main character. Regardless of his views on things he is very analytical and is written in a way where you can really understand what he is thinking as he acquires more information. I always thought the Republic SIS (the republic's covert spy and operations network) was underused in the old Republic era lore and this really adds some nice flavor and depth to their agents and operations. That being said, Theron also has a bit of a backstory with Grand Master of the Jedi Satele Shan and Supreme Republic Commander Jace Malcom and this is where it starts to become more of a mixed bag as the story that is included often feels tacked on for dramatic effect or is just awkward.<br /><br />There are more characters than Theron, Satele, and Jace though, and these characters often feel flat and uninteresting even when you want to feel otherwise. Theron has a female Twilek friend in a criminal gang that he often goes out of his way for and seems to really care for from his youth and his past with the Jedi. However, nothing ever really comes from or changes in<br />their odd relationship aside from her proving to be a useful contact later in the story. He is also accompanied by Master Gnost Dural whom some will remember from the SWTOR historical archives. He is a typical Jedi Master with the twist of the main villan being his former apprentice. He has little interest in saving her though and the only reason I cared about him was because of him being the same character who narrated the historical archives on the SWTOR website. He does his job as a Jedi well, but there is little depth or emotional connection to be had with his character. The villians are what you would expect from the Sith and, like Gnost Dural, they do their job without having any real depth or interest aside from the political machinations of the sith.<br /><br />Another thing that was nice in this book was being able to see the latest events in the Old Republic timeline and how the war between the Republic and Sith Empire was going in its latest incarnation. They throw you a bone with some glimpses of politics and comments pointing to the larger scope of the war but its nothign particulary in depth or substantial which I found a letdown and took away from the sense of scale and conflict. But in the end this is Therons story and all other devices<br />serve as a medium to tell it.<br /><br />It's a decent book in the Old Republic series and the character of Theron Shan is really the selling point of this book in my opinion. I would even like to see more SIS operations detailing new events in the war centered around his viewpoint or have him reappear as a supporting character in future peices of lore. But if you are looking for a good stand alone book that can really suck you into the Old Republic era I would give this a pass.", "images": [], "asin": "0345529413", "parent_asin": "0345529413", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1358988708000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

What I have liked about her other books are the non-stop action and the clever plot.  This book wasn't really a novel.  It's an editorial thinly wrapped in a story.  And the story plods.<br /><br />Ms. Sellers is using this book to press for decriminalizing drug use.  Her passion is so strong that I believe that she or someone very close to her spent some time in jail for drug possession.  When you are so passionate about an issue, I think you lose the perspective you need to write an interesting book.  For instance, the Amazon book description says that the main character is undercover but finds the group she's infiltrated to be sympathetic.  I don't think the writing in the story supported that contention.<br /><br />If you're considering this book as your first Sellers' story, I would select another one.  It isn't characteristic of her work.<br /><br />If you've looked at the other reviews, you can see that lots of people disagree with me.  If you feel as passionately as Ms. Sellers, you may like this book too because you'll be ardently agreeing with what she says and you won't notice that there is very little story.

This book reminded me of Zusak\u2019s Underdogs trilogy, probably because of the personality of the main character. I didn\u2019t really like those books, and I didn\u2019t really care for this story either. There was nothing inherently wrong with it\u2014it\u2019s a really neat, well-written story\u2014but it just wasn\u2019t for me.<br /><br />Ed was a fine character, but I didn\u2019t particularly connect with him or like him. I didn\u2019t dislike him either though. I did think the book\u2019s plot was smart. The ending was pretty great too, and although I should have guessed it, I didn\u2019t. But then the actual ending after the reveal was disappointing and left me with the obvious questions of who? I don\u2019t like not getting answers in my books.<br /><br />I like the message of this book: everyone is struggling with something and everyone needs help, and anyone can benefit and feel better after serving another. I think that\u2019s a great takeaway.<br /><br />Although this book grew on me the more I read it, I was still just feeling very meh about the whole thing by the end.<br /><br />If I Am the Messenger wasn\u2019t written by Markus Zusak, I doubt I would have read it. This is my fifth book by him, and the only good one was The Book Thief, unfortunately. I wish I liked them all, but I don\u2019t. I still have Bridge of Clay left but once I read that I\u2019ll have read all Zusak\u2019s books.

{"rating": 3, "title": "An Insider Novel-Too Narrow in Scope to be Satisfying", "text": "This novel was first published as daily installments in an Edinburgh newspaper.  In turn, the novel is divided into a 100+ very short chapters.  Alexander McCall Smith's intended audience was the Edinburgh newspaper readers who had to follow the novel on a daily basis.  Consequently, the novel is filled with insider references that Edinburgh readers would appreciate.  Afterall, it is always a little bit thrilling to see one's home town mentioned in a story.  All these inside references to neighborhoods and local politics are less interesting to a reader living in another country.<br /><br />I am a loyal fan of Alexander McCall Smith.  His Number One Ladies Detective Agency novels are subperb and the Professor Von Igelfeld stories are some of the funniest stories that I have ever read.  Unfortunately, McCall Smith does not deliver in this novel.  The story line is jagged and many interesting threads are never persued.  There are some very humorous moments but all in all the novel is strangely disjointed.<br /><br />Writing novels in daily or weekly chapters must be one of the most daunting tasks that any novelist can undertake.  Unfortunately, only the greatest writers can do this well.  Dumas and Dickens come to mind.  They were successful because they took on ambitious story lines with very wide scopes of detail and character.  McCall Smith fails in this novel because his scope is too narrow and pedestrian.  These small intimate Edinburgh stories are not made for daily newspaper deadlines.  Unfortunately, he could not realize this novel within the constraints of one newspaper column a day.  This would have been a much better novel, if he would have sat down and wrote it like a conventional novel.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A Movie Script in a Book", "text": "Storyline:  The story is about a boy, Mike, who runs away because he doesn't like the rules in the house.  He and his dog, Barney (who I pictured to be much smaller in the book than is shown in the trailer), get trapped on a railroad car traveling southeast.  When the train stops, they discover that they have been on a circus train and have traveled quite a distance from home.  Big Bob is a circus clown who takes Mike and Barney in.  And the story goes from there...<br /><br />Strengths:  The book moves at a good pace and flows well for the most part.  Readers are put in the driver's seat to imagine what everything looks like.  The book is a very fast read with simple language and sentence structure.  My husband felt it was a very competent book.  I asked his opinion since I happen to be a woman and not a man.  He felt it would be a very easy read for a child who is used to watching television and video games rather than reading books.<br /><br />Weaknesses:  This book is written at a 2nd or 3rd grade reading level, in my opinion.  It has as much description as Dori Hillestad Butler's The Buddy Files series.  Whereas, I felt the description was appropriate in The Buddy Files series, that is a weakness to me in this book because I would want even reluctant readers to learn to comprehend writing that is more detailed and specific.  This book (as you can see by the trailer) is really set in the 1950s or 1960s rather than today.  That isn't specified in the book.  There were also several points in the story that were very stilted to me.  For example, I wasn't sure how he got home in the first chapter of the book.<br /><br />Best Audience for this Book:  This book would be great for a child that is used to watching television and isn't used to a lot of descriptive language in a book.  It is written like a movie script without illustrations.<br /><br />My conclusions...<br />Is this a book you could hand your child and not worry about?  Yes. So, if you are of the mind that you just want your child to read and just want to make sure there isn't anything in the content to be concerned about, then this book would be fine.<br /><br />Is this a book I would recommend across the board?  Well...what we read becomes our model for how and what we write.  We want to read good examples of writing with description and good sentence structure because it helps us become better writers.  Reading helps our children learn how to write, how to spell, and even how to speak.  In education theory, there is an idea explained by Vygotsky about scaffolding.  We want children to read a step or two above where they're at.  We don't want them to get frustrated, but we do want them to be challenged.  This book is written at a 3rd grade reading level for readers 8-13 years old.  I think it would be appropriate reading for a 3rd, 4th, or 5th grade boy who is a reluctant reader.  If a boy is in middle school, they will need more examples of description so that their own writing can improve and they can grow in their ability to complete their school assignments.  This book is what I think a middle school boy might write.  That is fine.  But, by Vygotsky's theory, you want them to read a step or two above that.  The book I received in the mail today from the Christian Heroes: Then & Now series is a good example of that step above for a middle school reader.<br /><br />Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this book from Comfort Publishing for review.", "images": [], "asin": "0984559841", "parent_asin": "0984559841", "user_id": "AGAN3VWXL6UMM45GV4JJSEIDIXCA", "timestamp": 1302121669000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 3, "title": "The Good, Bad, & Ugly", "text": "These books are addictive, or I would not still be reading them, but IMO, the series has a number frustrating faults. On one hand, Mr. Martin can write chapters that are downright brilliant and are as good as any fantasy I have read. Most of the characters are well drawn with a sly sense of humor that can make me laugh out loud. Mr. Martin has a fertile, original imagination.<br /><br />On the other hand....<br /><br />After almost three thousand pages of reading, I am convinced that these books are intentionally padded with fluff that even Mr. Martin's considerable ability cannot sustain. Some scenes are bloated like a wordy first draft that was never edited.  The ability to write economically and move the plot along without unnecessary detail is not one of the author's strengths.  Characters have circular arguments that go on and on, even though the outcome is obvious. This kind of thing happens so often that it's got to be an end in itself.  These books are designed to be loonnnngggg, to bulge on bookstore shelves. I thought  \"Storm of Swords\" was better in this respect than the previous two volumes, but there were still segments I found just plain boring and needlessly over written at the expense of other plot lines.<br /><br />The way that most characters lose out most of the time in this series is a bit depressing and makes me wonder if the author was dealing with some personal demons. It's like a detective novel where the hero inevitably gets beaten up at the beginning, so pay back is sweeter in the end.  Well, there's been thousands of pages of \"beaten up,\" with very little \"payback.\" Also, there's been little romantic love or sex in this series, while there's been quite a bit more sex that's been either forced or paid for.  Why?<br /><br />Much has been made by some reviewers of the author's \"inventive\" killing off of main figures or radically changing their characters, or changing plot direction in this volume.  I just found this capricious and undisciplined. It's like Martin grew tired of some of his characters or didn't quite know what to do with them, or just had too many to deal with, so he bumped some of them off.  While this was done within a plot context, it had the air of simple authorial execution rather than really being plot driven.<br /><br />From the get go, I believe Mr. Martin has spent his writing day focusing on whatever he felt like. He introduces characters or locations that are quickly dropped for no apparent reason, yet he spends an inordinate amount of time on trivial behavior of other characters.  I really think he is making this stuff up almost as he is typing it. If he has any kind of overall vision for the arc of the plot, it appears to change all the time. This mutability is not the imitation of reality, it's authorial self-indulgence. (I am tempted to call it laziness, but the guy has cranked out several thousand pages.)<br /><br />Mr. Martin is particularly effective at manipulating the reader by generating suspense through parallel plotting and cliff hangers. This suspense is often cheap or artificial.  For example, a character appears to die at the end of a chapter. It turns out later that they did not.  Anyone who was in the room when they \"died\" would know they didn't die, but the author has miss-represented the facts to the reader to create suspense. Yes, that's an authorial tool, but I'd call it cheesy pulp writing and not very inventive. Mr. Martin uses such crutches to keep the reader interested. If his pacing was brisker, with tighter scenes and focused plotting that has internal logic, he wouldn't need such tricks.<br /><br />Mr. Martin is very diligent at setting lots of such manipulative suspense hooks to keep the reader reading and buying more books.  It's a needed spur for the reader to get through the boring bits.  \"Well this chapter is really dull, but I must push on to find out what happens to Tyrion in the next one.\" \"That last volume really dragged at times, but I've got to see if Dany gets to Westros with the dragon's in the next one.\"  When a reader has invested thousands of pages in a storyline, it's hard to just put it down, even if it is sometimes dull, especially if the author keeps hatching more intriguing plots than he ever resolves.<br /><br />I have read that there is a rumor that this series will end at six volumes.  Given the pace of plot development, I'm not sure Martin can or wants to end it at only six.  A better series title might be, \"George R R Martin's Perpetual IRA Machine.\"", "images": [], "asin": "0553106635", "parent_asin": "0553106635", "user_id": "AFMEVKYQSE7PPEKPK4Y2JKFE6IMQ", "timestamp": 1150396681000, "helpful_vote": 26, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Trek Isn't Supposed to be Depressing!", "text": "But this is! The book has 3 short stories set in the Star Trek universe, but from different perspectives of time. What would have happened if this person died or this person lived, or this person accepts a transfer to another ship or makes a scientific breakthrough, what have you. Well I don't want to give anything away, but the answer is pain, and unyielding horror and suffering apparently. The Trek as it played out on tv and the movies is apparently the only one worth living in as it is the only one with a potentially hopeful future.<br /><br />Both of the first two stories made me so sad I really didn't want to read the third. Nothing good happened. Usually with Trek even when they face terrible circumstances there is a sense of hopefullness, the possibility of coming through victorious. There was nothing of that here. Something bad happened and then something even worse happened after it and there was no end in sight. Kirk's doomed son, David Marcus is a main character in the first story \"The Chimes At Midnight\" and I can't think of another more tragic character with the possible exception of Othello or King Lear maybe. I haven't read a Shakesperian tragedy in 15 years, what does that tell you, that I should think of such a thing while reading this?<br /><br />It makes me sadder than I can say to give a Star Trek book only 2 stars. Really I'd give it 2 1/2 just cause its Trek but they don't do that here, more's the pity. Still the third story Brave New World was good. It had hope. It has nearly isurmountable odds that our intrepid heroes overcome with cunning and and intelligence and good old fashioned sticktoittiveness. Get the book for that story alone.<br /><br />I'll say this: if you like never ending drama, like the new BattleStar Galactica series, then you should be alright with the first two stories.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Another good holiday read", "text": "Like most of Katia Lief's novels, \"Next Time You See Me\" (aka \"[[ASIN:B00563M3I8 Hide and Seek]]\" -- its UK title) is an above-averagely penned thriller, which makes for an excellent novel for a long plane flight, or an idle few days on the beach.  The story is a sequel to the \"[[ASIN:0091937914 You Are Next]]\" but does not require the reader to have read the earlier work. Indeed, its plot line spins out in an entirely new direction, although readers of the earlier volume may find themselves wondering more than a few times whether it will suddenly tie into the earlier one in some meatier sort of a way.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, the book would convert effortlessly and effectively into a screenplay; it has the right mix of action and dialogue, a comfortable cast size and a sufficiently simple (simplistic almost) plot-line but with a potent narrative capable of delivering a comfortable suspension of disbelief through an atavistic response to the story's emotional flow, rather than needing any rational figuring of the events themselves.<br /><br />Also like its predecessor, the book delivers no real surprises, but neither does it disappoint; it's worth more than three stars really but doesn't quite deserve four.", "images": [], "asin": "0061809047", "parent_asin": "0061809047", "user_id": "AFSEPFTJPNIIEQKDPCIEQSLSFBLQ", "timestamp": 1335723188000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

So, let's start with the characters. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan need no introduction. However, there is this character Rael Averross,who is supposed to be a Jedi, but dresses like a slob, smokes, drinks alot, sleeps around and doesn't seem to have anything to do with \" The Force \". Also, he made a bad decision, that obviously should not have been made, that got his Padawan killed. Ok so the Jedi Council sends him off to rule a planet until its princess , who is a child, is old enough to be crowned Queen. Really? This guy can't handle the job so he asks for back up namely Qui-Gon with Obi-Wan his Padawan, who are at odds for most of the story because they each think they have failed the other. Also, the Jedi Council has invited Qui-Gon to join the Council. Now Qui-Gon  believes in old Jedi prophecies, which the others including Obi-Wan don't, and he actually seems to be one with The Force, when needed. He has a record of being at odds with the Council at times and a bit of a free thinker which master Yoda certainly doesn't care for since he voted against the invite.  So, before Qui-Gon decides off they go to help Rael. They get there and the story drags on and on about the usual corporate greed, mining, using slaves, etc. Now there's a story line involving a couple of jewl thieves that should've been completely left out, imho, since it takes away from the main plot, which is infantile at best, again imho. There's a group of bad guys who are good guys that actually want to save the planet from the other bad guys etc. It's a mess but not one that makes sense in the end. Real is so useless as a Jedi he doesn't have a clue as to what's going on  even at the end when his precious child Queen, whom he adores, turns on him and loathes him more than any other creature in the galaxy.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Stupid is as stupid does", "text": "I write this for those who are not deterred by the negative reviews. I wasn't! wasn't expecting much, but at least hoped for some fun. Wikipedia is actually my idea of fun so I at least thought a thriller about fun things like codes and history and conspiracy theories such would be at least entertaining, even if the majority of the book consisted of People Talking About Things. Moreover, my standards for popular paperback thrillers are low (if people are complaining about the terrible writing, they clearly haven't read many bestseller thrillers. I mean, somebody want to defend the literary skills of Rollins or Grisham etc? Bahaha).<br /><br />Where do I begin with the Stupid? I will not bore you with a laundry list. Suffice it to say that the first time any character does anything remotely intelligent is in chapter *110* when a CIA agent notices wheelchair marks in the carpet (no worries, not a spolier and nothing any generic detective wouldn't figure out).<br /><br />I am a fan of far-fetched plots so long as they're logical within their world, so to speak. I'll suspend disbelief as long as the storytelling is good. I'll even excuse the bloated and formulaic plotting since I have a ffwd button I don't mind using as the same pointless details/dialog are repeated for the 110th time. But all of the above is so dumb I could only imagine that Brown was making stuff up as he went along. Plot twists actually rely on people doing stupid, illogical things. This is not fun.<br /><br />Critics have panned Brown for his latest book being nothing but a glorified travel guide, and even that doesn't bother me! So long as it's interesting and absorbing enough. I didn't mind the Dan Brown Wikipedia Lectures in the beginning...until the story began to fall so flat that my mind would start wandering as I imagined Dan Brown on his 3-day tour of DC grabbing museum brochures and recording docent lectures. Not that I don't like museum brochures. I just don't want to see Dan Brown copying them on his computer, I'd rather be able to imagine characters in those places, which my visions of Dan Brown on Tour kept blocking.<br /><br />Critics have panned Robert Langdon as being supercilious and obnoxious as he lectures everyone because he's smarter than everyone else. Lecture away, professor, so long as what you have to say is actually professor-like! Okay, true, there are lots of misinformed supercilious professors out there. However! The Internet! Libraries! People who know more about a subject than you the writer and can easily be interviewed! More than one book on a topic! Robert Langdon is, in this book, weirdly uninformed about certain religious texts he spouts off about. I've been annoyed by cheap research in other thrillers too, but Langdon should know better! So should his esoteric buddies.<br /><br />I'm telling all of y'all, I should've gotten some enjoyment out of this book. My standards were low, I'm a nerd who likes lectures, I have no fear of skipping pointless passages. But I wasted my time! I should've taken a clue from the Wikipedia article on this book that was probably buffed up by a publicist trying to rebut criticisms of the book...I wondered why even Hollywood dropped the story and politely moved on to Inferno instead. I imagine that, in spite of having paid Brown a ton of moola for it, they eventually had to realize it no amount of script doctoring could make it into more than a terribly boring movie.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're still not deterred, I strongly suggest instead of dropping your hard-earned money on this disappointing story that you borrow this from your local library (tons of *free!* electronic books/audiobooks if you knew not) and be ready to listen to it on 1.5x with your finger on the ffwd button.", "images": [], "asin": "0307950689", "parent_asin": "0307950689", "user_id": "AEZ74DSSJXQICPNTBMKZVFQDQFTQ", "timestamp": 1455869303000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Disjointed and short on detail but conveys the horror.", "text": "Caruso was a Lieutenant in the 9th Marines, 3rd Marine division, which he joined towards the end of its time on Guam. He was involved in only one combat incident there but his two weeks on Iwo saw him exposed to a lot more. Unfortunately these are generally presented in short vignettes, sometimes with minimal detail and a lack of context in terms of when it took place. There are a few occasions where he does go into more detail, like when he is under attack at night, with grenades landing in his foxhole but mostly he is too sparse with the details and it is clear he left a lot out. There are quite a few passages provided by fellow veterans and some of these are quite graphic. They serve, to an extent, in fleshing Caruso's story out a little more. Caruso also includes some potted histories for some of the men he knew who were killed. Altogether these certainly convey the horror of the battle but Caruso's own story is lost at times.<br /><br />Caruso was clearly the real deal as a soldier. The five officers above him were all first day casualties and he found himself commanding the company - from the front - almost from the start. He does provide some interesting information regarding some of his decisions but mostly he is writing about his interactions with his brother marines. Many of these become casualties and he provides statistics that emphasize the scale of these. By the time he is wounded less than 40 men are left in his company.<br /><br />This is a short book that can easily be read in a few hours. It is based on some articles Caruso did about the campaign, which were apparently very well received by fellow veterans. Perhaps because of this, it is closer to a memorial to his comrades than a typical personal memoir - it is just not complete enough for me for that. It doesn't conform to a traditional narrative structure and Caruso doesn't build his story. Accordingly, in my opinion, it fails to engage the reader. I'd have liked to give it 2 1/2 stars. It is still informative in a general way though and the tragedy of it all is very clear. But there are other memoirs (see my list) where it is all revealed in a more complete and compelling manner.

I like that she explained some of their history and how their society works, where they live, how they've managed to stay hidden for so long, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The main character's mother was confusing to me. I suppose she'll be explained in further detail in the following books, especially considering what we learn at the end of the book, but as it is in this one, she seemed to flip back and forth and her reactions to some things were unusual (some readers may point out that that too could be attributed to her secret but considering how long she has lived the way she does, I don't buy it). And actually I felt that way about a few characters - they made dramatic shifts in mood and opinions, and some of their reasoning didn't really make sense.<br />*Predictable. Emma wasn't that much of a mystery to me. In fact I spent most of the book wondering why it took Galen and the other characters so long to figure out what she was and why. Heck it had to basically be pointed out to them.<br />*I get that grieving is different for everyone and some time has passed, but I thought that Emma's overall reaction to the loss of her best and seemingly only friend was a bit well, it flipped back and forth. At first it seemed very realistic but then Galen showed up and it was like she forgot except for very few later points in the book that were used to further the plot.<br />*Based on what I know about shark attacks, I would say that this one was VERY unrealistic. That should have been researched better.<br /><br />On a personal note, why does everything have to be a series? Authors can't get to the point in one book anymore. I ordered three books from amazon vine all from separate authors, only one didn't turn out to be the first in a series.

The author follows a set of unlikely characters involved in the shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage.  Canaris, Heydrich, plus a cast of made up characters, all play their individual parts in this story.<br /><br />We follow a semi-plot of Canaris reaching out to more neutral elements in the United States, and being thwarted time and time again.  We follow a US Senator, his \u201cfixer\u201d and his delicate son as they weave in and out of the fairly convoluted plot.<br /><br />This is one of those books, to my observation, that tries to be more that it is \u2013 pointing the way towards some elusive message.  So, I had a really hard time deciding if this was a three star book trying for four stars, or if it was a four star book, failing to bring in that fourth star and only getting three.  In the end, since I cannot give 3.5 stars, I will settle on three.<br /><br />The author speaks German, and wants to brag about that \u2013 so many phrases in German and without the following translation in English \u2013 pretentious, is my interpretation.  And put in places they were not needed to move the plot along \u2013 for example \u2013 the mention that the film playing was Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cSchneewittchen und die sieben Zwerge\u201d \u2013 which translates as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2013 but the author does not tell you that \u2013 I am.  As far as I was concerned \u2013 unneeded level of complexity or bragging.<br /><br />A pet peeve of mine is the term \u201cgone missing\u201d \u2013 this is a 21st century affectation \u2013 the term is \u201cmissing\u201d \u2013 as in \u201cthe man is missing\u201d not \u201cthe man has gone missing\u201d, or even worse \u201cthe man went missing.\u201d  The author uses \u201cgone missing\u201d in this novel set in 1938 \u2013 that phrase would not have been used.<br /><br />Another pet peeve of mine, people in trouble, take out enemies and then flee, and do not pick up the weapons of the fallen enemy so they have a weapon for future use \u2013 this happens when Oskar slashes the Gestapo man with the knife, and then leaves a perfectly good weapon (pistol) as they move off.  At least the author has Von Ewigholz think to take the weapon from the other dead Gestapo agent, when his Walther PPK runs dry.  Speaking of said PPK \u2013 Oskar carries it for several days, without ever checking to see exactly how many cartridges (note, cartridges not bullets) it contained after they had acquired it.  Another pet peeve \u2013 a cartridge is the entire package \u2013 shell casing, primer, powder, and bullet \u2013 a bullet is just the lead projectile \u2013 thus it is incorrect to say how many bullets are in a weapon \u2013 the correct usage is to say how many cartridges are in the weapon.<br /><br />The author has one of the SS characters in the book standing at his Berlin office on Prinz-Albrecht- Strasse in his office of the \u201cReich Security Main Office\u201d.  The correct term is &#34;Reich Main Security Office\u201d.  For an author that keeps banging us over the head with German phrases, to get this wrong is very jarring.<br /><br />One thing I will give the author is his correct attitude of the German people towards \u201cjaywalking\u201d.  They do not do it.  He has the comment made that the people jaywalking must be tourists.  Very true \u2013 on the street in Frankfurt 20-25 years ago we watched as tourist parents took their child across the road before the light had changed, and they were yelled at by the locals saying they were setting a bad example for their child and were being bad parents.  To be honest, I agreed!<br /><br />A very detailed book \u2013 and it does give a fairly accurate feeling of how it feels to live in a police state where one has to watch every word spoken and care must be taken to whom one will speak freely, even when there is supposedly no one listening.  After all, being paranoid is not crazy when there really are people out there trying to get you.  Just ask most any student on a University Campus today.<br /><br />An interesting book \u2013 it won\u2019t be for everyone \u2013 and as I said right between a 3 and 4 star rating.", "images": [], "asin": "0307270831", "parent_asin": "0307270831", "user_id": "AGFNWLAN7XVFFQEUOG32CPTCSKWQ", "timestamp": 1489334424000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

Going out of her way to shield herself from human contact to suppress her abilities has branded her as a freak at her new high school--but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste...<br />Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition.  He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets.  Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she's thinking--and he's the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head.  She doesn't know who he really is--or what he is.  Damen equal parts light and darkness, and he belongs to an enchanted new world where no one ever dies.<br />* * *<br /><br />Evermore was simply another fish in the current of mainstream paranormal romance. Admittedly, the idea of Alchemy is not a great deal common, but there are the unavoidable stereotypes that hold true throughout all of today's YA Paranormal Fantasy.<br /><br />The unearthly beautiful boy who captivates the female protagonist with his unique looks and debonair charm that NO other man could ever equate to.<br />The main female character that is utterly defenseless when it comes to her love interest.

I can see where the Twilight comparisons come in, but, really, look at Evermore for what it is: A fun read.<br /><br />Ever was kind of bratty, I thought. She was too stuck in the past, not even trying to move forward with her life. She alienated everyone, even her two best friends Miles and Haven. I understand she lost her family in a car accident, but she won't even give her aunt the gratitude she deserves for taking care of Ever.

{"rating": 2, "title": "I don't see this helping", "text": "This does not help students.<br /><br />There are fundamental flaws with the ICTS Basic Skills Test system period.<br />It is not a cheap test to take - it is not covered by grants or scholarships, it is pretty much<br />out of pocket.<br /><br />You can use this prep material, the prep material on the ICTS website, or any of the host of other<br />ICTS 300 test prep books available, but it won't help you.<br /><br />Why?  Because you will never know what you missed on the test.<br />That's right. ICTS only gives you your numeric score and a pass/fail graph results.<br />Each test section you took has a results page. They all lead to the exact same page, which is only the graph and number (like Reading - 199).  You will never be allowed to see your test answers, never allowed to know what areas in which you are weak.<br />This is a huge flaw. ICTS claims they can't give back test results because people would cheat. Sounds to me like the only ones cheating are the folks at ICTS. They cheat the students out of any real help this way.<br /><br />Let's say you scored 180 on the math out of a possible 300 (and the needed 240). Okay, you missed the goal by at least 60 points.<br />So, where is your weakness?  Instead of results that even go so far as to say you got 80% of the algebra questions right, 40% of the geometry questions right and 75% of the basic math right, you get a blanket number with no breakdown. You won't know if you are weak in geometry or some other area. You might have had a perfect score on all the geometry, but messed up the algebra questions, and need to review algebra. You'll never know.<br /><br />As it is, this is a nice financial racket for ICTS, but only milks the students. The Basic Skills 300 is very expensive to take.<br />The majority of students now fail this test after the Sep 2010 changes. I don't think a whole set of students suddenly got dumber, but that is what this test would lead someone to think. It keeps a lot of very good students out of their desired major, because without a score of at least 240 on each of the sections of this test, you cannot get into the education programs. Wanted to be a teacher since you were in elementary yourself? Can't think of anything else you've ever wanted to do? well, time to rethink your life, because Illinois has decided for you that if you can't pass their test with random hidden scoring, you can't possibly teach.<br /><br />What this test DOES do is show who can test well, or who is fresh out of high school.<br />Those people who love tests as a challenge or personal game to be won will love it. The white-knuckle testers, those<br />who break out into a sweat when they hear the word \"test\" will likely fail.<br />Those who are recent high school graduates will have all of this sort of data fresh on their minds, and probably do okay.<br />If you are older, it has been a while since you were in school and you want to go back for a teaching certificate<br />now that your kids are older, good luck with passing! You probably won't be able to get certified in Illinois. After all, there is a<br />shortage of teachers, IL certainly does not rank highly in national testing results, so instead of helping more students<br />get into good programs, they keep them at arm's length and lock them out. There are people with master's degrees who cannot<br />pass this test. Of course, they won't know why either, because of the ICTS policy of not sharing ANYTHING about your test results<br />with you except the grand total.<br /><br />Until ICTS can help students know WHAT they missed so they can study harder, it is a total shot in the dark, and both a waste<br />of money and time. The education programs in the state of Illinois are already very limited in scope and in the amount of space for students. They don't put education as a priority here, in my opinion. I didn't grow up here, thank goodness. But my spouse who did still is lacking in some very basic skills. Much like many states are doing, teachers teach to meet federal funding guidelines, rather than making sure all students have the skills they are trying to teach. They have a tight timeline and can't really spend the time with students like they should - the principal will be on their backs about meeting the school goals for federal funds.<br />So, ICTS helps to feed the un-education machine here by putting this test as a requirement, with nothing but practice tests to go on - there is NOTHING a student can do to help find out what they are missing on the tests. NOTHING. So, students continue to practice a broad variety of skills in hopes of passing it the next time they take it. Good luck - it's another random shot. You'll still not know what you missed or didn't miss - only the little black and white graph that will tell you if you tested good enough to apply to an education program.<br /><br />So, to sum up, if you don't pass the test the first time, you won't know why. You can, however, pay even more money out to ICTS for another chance to waste a morning several months later, long after you need to have passed. You can't get into the IL education programs to help you learn to be an effective teacher until you can prove you already know everything and don't need the program.<br />Yep - if you can do a great job on the test and already HAVE all the skills, then we'll let you into the education program, and you can spend the next two or three years taking classes that might or might not help you actually be a good teacher. But hey - it's only money and time. Those are both endless, right?  Right? (And I think we've all had teachers that were very smart themselves, probably  passed this test with a great score, but who can't manage to communicate the subject matter to the students, or who makes the students hate the subject after being in one of their classes! What a waste of human resources - this test rules out a lot of very good people who are not strong test takers.)<br /><br />This test proves NOTHING except showing who is good at taking tests.<br />It shows NOTHING about the potential to be a great teacher.<br />You can practice until you see test questions in your sleep, but you still will never know what you need to work on, because<br />ICTS keeps it all a secret.", "images": [], "asin": "0738608041", "parent_asin": "0738608041", "user_id": "AFTEMMCIMU62ONZHLLXEXSME4Z6Q", "timestamp": 1312697762000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 1}

It is a nice idea, but it does not work for several reasons. First of all, most of us did not read these books in English classes we took in high school. In fact few books are read in their entirety in English classes; plays, poems and anthologies being preferred as they are shorter and thus provide a wider range of reading experiences. Secondly, some of Smokler\u2019s choices are obscure or lesser works and some are not even books.  Rather, the choices seem to be preferences that the author has now in his adult professional capacity.  Third, what you read in high school depends to a large degree on what school you attended and when. Also, it may be nitpicking, but why are these books \u201cpractical\u201d classics; how does this term differ from an ordinary classic? Finally, Smokler really does not provide much of a comparison between the experience of reading these works as a teenager and reading them as a mature adult.  Instead each passage includes information about the author and some critical and usually positive commentary about the book, the sort of information that is found in standard book reviews.  In sum, Practical Classics reads more like a series of book reviews than an effort to understand books from two different perspectives. Still, the book may well be worth reading.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Disappointing book and code on audio signal processing", "text": "This book is simply hideous, and if the rating system would let me give it zero stars I would do just that. The text will not enlighten you if you do not understand audio signal processing, and if you already do understand it, nothing will be added to your knowledge. The only thing worthwhile about the book is the table of contents, since it does act as an outline of the subjects you should know, in order, if you intend to learn about digital audio signal processing. Following this table of contents as a guide, you should learn about psychoacoustics, digital signal processing in general, analysis & synthesis of sound, user interface methods, and finally effects specific to sound and compression methods if you wish to call yourself knowledgeable of audio signal processing. Unfortunately, you will learn none of that from this book. Instead, what you get is a sort of wandering novel consisting of the author's memoirs and musings on signal processing subjects. There are virtually no instructive diagrams, no equations, no pseudocode, just page after page of conversational text. Sure, I grant you that the author talks about subjects that I have not found in other texts, but that is part of the whole problem- he just chatters on incessantly about these subjects without being the least bit instructive. Some authors who write useless texts at least include source code on their CD's that partially make up for their lack of talent as writers/instructors. In this case you shall have no such luck. The code is one monolithic ball of lint so deeply entrenched in windows-specific MFC code that it is virtually impossible to unravel. There are no comments to speak of to enlighten you as to what is going on in any of the code. Instead the reader will find comments such as \"i suggest somebody to fix that\" and \"saves typing later\".<br />If you do want to learn about digital audio processing, you might want to take a tip from the table of contents and start with psychoacoustics and pick up the excellent \"Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics\" by Perry Cook, which is good enough for self-study. For DSP for the music-centric reader, try \"A Digital Signal Processing Primer : With Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music\" by Ken Steiglitz- it is very instructive, has plenty of equations and diagrams, and reads like a novel. Next, for analysis and synthesis of sound, find a copy of \"Musical Applications of Microprocessors\" by Hal Chamberlain. It was written in 1985, but it is an excellent introduction to sound analysis and synthesis in general and has a very good section on digital filters specific to audio. These three volumes should get you on your way to saying you understand digital audio processing. If you are a more advanced reader, read the two excellent volumes by Udo Zolzer- \"Digital Audio Signal Processing\" and \"DAFX\"- in that order.", "images": [], "asin": "0879305665", "parent_asin": "0879305665", "user_id": "AGLMH7GYYOVSH3IFQDXJZQLWZ3HQ", "timestamp": 1131207468000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 1}

{"rating": 1, "title": "Well Written and Interesting - but not Trustworthy", "text": "This book is frustrating. It is an interesting subject and it is both well written and well documented. So if you come a cross some factoid that you wonder about - there is enough material in the text (but not in footnotes) that you can trace the topic back to its source. But the tone of the text lends a certain skepticism. Mr. Mann is an advocate not just an observer. He takes the position that the Indians who occupied the Americas before Columbus were good and the Europeans who came across the oceans at the end of the fifteenth century were bad. He has a lot of scholarship but his has a persistent anti-white bias that make the whole book questionable.<br /><br />Let me give a simple easy to understand example. He writes (on page 136) that the worst calumny against the Aztecs is the charge of human sacrifice. Mann admits that the Aztecs (which he calls the Triple Alliance) did commit human sacrifice but equates it with the Spanish Auto-da-fe. there are several problems with this account. First Human Sacrifice was not and never has been main atrocity attributed to the Aztecs. The Aztec practice that he totally ignores is cannibalism. Secondly the Spanish auto-da-fe kills only a relatively small number of people whereas the Aztec body count in their ceremonies was much larger. And of course many authorities think the reason the Aztecs were constantly at war with their neighbors was for meat.<br /><br />Wikipedia states that all the victims of the Spanish Inquisition over the entire period of the Counter Reformation were probably only about 3,000 victims. Wikipedia also cites authorities including Victor Davis Hansen that the annual number of human sacrifices by the Aztecs alone was at least 20,000 and may have been as high as 84,000. And you must remember that the Maya and other groups were also holding their own slaughters. The Spanish Inquisition took place for a few years and then stopped. The Mesoamerican human sacrifices took place annually for centuries. Another difference is that the Auto-da-Fe was for adults only whereas the Aztec and the Maya seemed to prefer to sacrifice children. Go to the Yucatan and the tour guides will show the holes where the Maya threw teenagers every year to bring rains.<br /><br />Most modern readers find it hard to admire the Aztecs because they seem to have been a large scale cannibal culture.<br /><br />On page 141 Ma section labeled &#34; Assigning Blame&#34;. Not surprisingly Mann assigns the decimation of New World Indians to the Europeans who introduced Small Pox and other diseases. But this is a myopic judgement. Small Pox may have begun in China. We can't be sure but we do know that Small Pox decimated China and brought an end to the Han Dynasty. Shortly thereafter Small Pox got to Rome (the Antonine Plague) and brought about the decline of the Roman Empire. Small Pox stayed in Europe and Asia for another thousand years . Not surprisingly when Europeans got across the Atlantic they had no choice but to bring Small Pox with them.<br /><br />Five hundred years later white people found a cure for Small Pox and exterminated the virus. You would think that whites rather than being blamed, whites should be thanked for their medical science. The Indians in the New World were victims of Smallpox. It destroyed their civilization just as it had earlier destroyed the civilizations of Rome and China. Fortunately white men found a cure.", "images": [], "asin": "1400032059", "parent_asin": "1400032059", "user_id": "AH7YW43GRNF4KXK2MBZQ7SLEM2SA", "timestamp": 1483752516000, "helpful_vote": 152, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

{"rating": 3, "title": "So you want to be a chef", "text": "Issue 3 of Lucky Peach continues to be a good read, but this issue isn't as strong or nearly as accessible as the first two.  It's the cooks and chefs issue!<br /><br />What does that even mean?  Are there celebrity chefs uttering expletives and regaling us with tales of drunken rampage, cynicism, and life itself?  It means that this issue isn't for everyone.  Yes, there's cussing.  There's also plenty of fantastic stories of and interviews with chefs that range from street food vendors in southeast Asia, to head chefs of Michelin rated restaurants, and everyone in between.  There's also some interesting food tossed in for good measure.<br /><br />If you're someone who is interested in cooking as a career, or wish to have a restaurant of your own some day, this issue is for you.  Some of the lessons and warnings you may have heard before, but it's always nice to get a good slap in the face every now and again for a reality check.  Especially when it's so well written and in giggle inducing anecdotes.  Lucky Peach issue 3 explores a lot of the trials and tribulations of making the career choice of being a cook.  \"Enroll in the Culinary Institute\", they said. \"Be a cook, it'll be FUN\", they said.  Like that old trope on joining the military, being a cook isn't without its share of dangers and unintended consequences.  Chang et al share their ideas on what this career (and lifestyle, in many cases), means for them and where they think it's headed.  For better or worse.<br /><br />I'm not a professional chef, nor do I have aspirations of ever being one.  I don't know the names of all of the hot restaurants and 85% of the famous chef's names dropped within the first 5 pages.  Nor do I care to.  There's nothing wrong with people that do follow those things, but my interest in Lucky Peach and food writing stems from a desire to be awesome in finding inspiration to do interesting things in the kitchen, that my family has yet to experience.  And that causes a little bit of a disconnect for me with this issue.  Entering my 30's, I can totally relate to a lot of the experiences and questions raised when one is figuring out just what the endgame is in any career choice; those things are communicated through the lens of the culinary world in this issue, but they could easily apply to any trade, from porn producer to plumber (same thing?).<br /><br />Again, it's a great read, but I can see this issue not having as broad appeal as the first two.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Saint Louis is Still in Better Shape Than This Book Ever Was", "text": "So Jonathan Franzen is the new greatest American author, huh?  With accolades over his latest novel and the cover of Time magazine, I can only assume that he has improved substantially since writing THE 27TH CITY, his first novel.  And assume I will continue doing because, to put it mildly, this clunker did not exactly whet my appetite to dig further into his works.  It is almost difficult to pull the separate strands apart as to what makes this book really quite bad.<br /><br />The characters themselves are two-dimensional, none giving us a reason to care what happens to them, and none are drawn very realistically.  Bad enough that, but add in numerous minor characters with meaningless connections with everything else, and who add basically nothing to the book except the frustration of taking the reader on meandering tangents, and one cannot help but think that Franzen put them in just to make the book bigger and more ambitious than was warranted.<br /><br />Franzen, apparently under some belief that his characters are not the only ones who should meander, treats us to prose equally confused.  Really, I do not need or even want things just spoon fed to me.  But there were times, more than a few, in THE 27TH CITY, when I had to stop and simply figure out which of the (many useless) characters was actually the focus of some such passage.  This narrative is more winding than 1970s Latin American magical realism, even more unappetizing on American soil.<br /><br />And, really, the plot?  Truly, and I mean truly, ridiculous.  Those pesky Indians coming over to old Saint Lou and just blow the place to smithereens!  Helicopter attacks on private homes, bombs exploding in stadiums.  Yeah, and no one connects the dots.  No FBI figuring out, hey, this is the same type of work done by communist insurgents on the subcontinent, and a bunch of them just moved into town; Hey, maybe there is a connection!!  This level of suspension of disbelief is usually reserved for the works of Ray Bradbury but would be a stretch even for a typical John Irving book.  That Franzen was clearly trying to write an even more realistic novel makes this plot line all the more ludicrous.<br /><br />Sometimes I read an author (Ian McEwan comes to mind) and, based on one book, I want to read more.

{"rating": 1, "title": "rip off alert", "text": "1 star only because Amazon doesn't have 0 stars as an option...<br /><br />Nothing at all in this book resembles the marketing for it or the description for it (the blurb on the dust cover has nothing to do with the content of the book either). Events/characters from the first book - which I enjoyed - are barely mentioned in passing in this one. Anyone buying this, expecting the plot to actually continue - you know, like is kinda sorta *normal* in a sequel - you're out of luck. This looks to be another one of those sci-fi series about to split off into a half a dozen different storylines, with multiple authors *supposedly* co-authoring books with the writer who started the original (you know, like basically every title Baen books publishes, for instance); books which often only vaguely resemble the original work, if at all. Books that I suspect the original authors have little or anything to do with writing.<br /><br />But, the most damning thing about this book is that it's utterly boring. We get stuck with one of sci-fi writers' favorite tricks to fill pages...a \"data dump\" on the space navy hierarchy/procedures for a newbie on board Troy and another one on becoming a welder in space. Fills up the pages, for sure. And of zero interest to me.<br /><br />No thanks.

What is the point?  Nothing really became of the story.  There was lack of a sense of adventure you expect to find with stories that concentrate on exploration of the unknown.  There wasn't much action and the heroine spent most of her time thinking, researching books and databases, instead of exploring the final frontier.<br /><br />I did manage to read this entire book, however, I do admit to skipping through the long-winded parts [which were many].

{"rating": 3, "title": "Of historical interest to conservationists. Recommended for library collections", "text": "I had very high hopes for Paul Errington's OF WILDERNESS AND WOLVES. After all, I was enthralled by Canadian Farley Mowat's classic, NEVER CRY WOLF, many years ago. But I found the Errington book rather disappointing, mainly because of its awkward, often wooden writing style. While Errington was much respected and widely recognized in his own time as a naturalist and conservationist, writing appears to have been somewhat problematic for him. We learn from editor Matthew Wynn Silvis's Introduction that Errington first wrote OF WILDERNESS AND WOLVES in the sixties, but he was never able to get it published. This University of Iowa Press edition is the first time these essays have been published in book form. Ironically, perhaps the main reason Errington could not get his book published was that it was submitted at about the same time that Mowat's NEVER CRY WOLF (1963) was published. Errington's publishers probably knew that Mowat's book, already enormously successful - and far more readable - would overshadow Errington's work.<br /><br />And I think they were right. Because far too much of Errington's text - certainly the first hundred-plus pages - are marred by stilted unnatural prose. Here are a couple of examples -<br /><br />&#34;Complexities in natural relationships have surely been a part of Life as long as Life has been on our planet, and surely Life has been acquiring complexity in relationships as it has been acquiring complexity in its forms.&#34;<br /><br /> - or -<br /><br />&#34;The public generally overrates the population effects of predation upon wild animals, at the same time generally underrating the effects of the less spectacular factors that may operate more fundamentally.&#34;<br /><br />I mean, try reading a few dozen pages of that kind of prose without yawning, I dare you. Especially when what you really wanted - were expecting - was an interesting story of wolves and life in the wilderness. Instead you get what reads like an awkward dissertation or scholarly study. And it IS a scholarly study. I get that. But in reaching for that distinction, Errington made the results of his prodigious research, along with his years of field work and personal observation, simply, well, dull.<br /><br />For me, the one redeeming section of the book, the one INTERESTING and most readable part, was &#34;Of Wolves and the Big Bog.&#34; In that chapter he falls into a much more personal, mostly first-person, mode, telling of a winter he spent as a young man (circa 1921) camping alone, hunting and trapping. He lived in a primitive shack on the northern shore of Upper Red Lake. The Big Bog was -<br /><br />&#34;... a vast swampy area. There on Minnesota road maps, occupying most of the north central part of the state and extending up to the Canadian border, lay one of the biggest blank spaces in the United States.&#34;<br /><br />Although he hoped to bag a wolf or two that winter, he only caught fleeting glimpses of them. There was plenty of other wildlife available though - lynx, fisher, weasel, muskrat, beaver, bobcat and more - and his traplines were pretty lucrative. He tells too of his loneliness and his friendship with a white-footed mouse that shared his cabin and &#34;cached prune pits in my footwear.&#34; Errington's solitary winter in the Big Bog country brought to mind another book I read years ago, Pete Fromm's marvelous memoir, INDIAN CREEK CHRONICLES: A WINTER ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS.<br /><br />One good chapter, however, does not a great book make. Much of the remainder of the book was something of a slog, seemingly cobbled together, with frequent citations from Aldo Leopold, his son, Starker Leopold, and other noted naturalists, a section about wolves in Scandinavia, and a brief mention of an ongoing study of wolves and moose on Isle Royale in Lake Superior. This latter reference served to remind me how very long ago Errington was writing this book, as numerous studies have since come out about the Isle Royale wolf packs.<br /><br />Iowa is to be commended for finally bringing Errington's work on wolves into print, because there is, I am sure, plenty of important wolf-and-wilderness data here, and scholars of those subjects will probably find much to ponder. I doubt, however, that the general public will find very much of interest here. Recommended primarily for library collections.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Bummer", "text": "I was so excited, empowered and happy after reading conversations with God Book 1 (CWG), that I ran to the book store to see which book I should read next.<br /><br />One thing I noticed while trying to decide on a book, was that all the books I was checking, started off with the similar statement of \"you have been led to get this book by a higher power\", not in those exact words, but that was the message. The first time I heard that was when reading (listening to the audiobook) CWG book 1. The first time ever hearing those words felt magical like \"it was meant to be, meant for me\". Reading it at the beginning of each of the other books I looked through, made me feel foolish.<br /><br />Because CWG Book 1 was such an awesome experience (I finished it In a few days, then went back to listen to it again). I decided to get another in the CWG series to see if I experienced the same \"awe\" and purchased the Communion With God audiobook.<br /><br />I was disappointed with Communion with God, it contradicted some of the things explained in CWG book 1. In CWG book 1, one of the things that gave me comfort was that it stated that when we are lookimg to God for guidance or answers God tries to answer us with signs or by trying to speak to us through our feelings, or giving us ideas\\inspiration and if we ignore these even by a song like when we turn on the radio. It stated that God is always communicating with us. However in Communion with God, he states that:<br /><br />* There are no signs<br />* God gave us free will for us to do what we want to, therefore God is not going to direct us<br />* God would not be so cruel as to communicate with us by using signs, if God wanted to communicate with us God would just talk to us directly. Neale states in this book (through the voice of God) that God could present him\\herself to us if communication was necessary....<br /><br />Hmm totally different than what was said in CWG book 1.<br /><br />Communion with God it states you should not choose masters that tell you that the only way to connect with God is if you buy this or that book or if you follow this religion or that. That you only need to silence your mind and go within... Well as my trip to the library showed.... There are a bunch of CWG books, later when reading Amazon reviews online I even found out about CWG memberships and seminars.

The hero and heroine were high school sweethearts until he decided to break up with her before she could break up with him, now years later his pro football career was ended early due to an injury and her life is tabloid fodder when she is dumped by her A-lister Hollywood boyfriend for someone else. They both return home at the same time and end up in a competition over the building her grandmother\u2019s pet boarding business is in.<br /><br />I had a hard time connecting with both of these characters, they were perfectly fine but I honestly felt like we never really got to know them.  Tony (Cam) Cammareri came home to get away from the media and try and figure out his next step which he believes is opening a sports bar type establishment in his home town.  Hadley Wells has worked saving the reputations of some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars but the uproar over her relationship going south sends her packing back to Seashell Harbor where she plans to rest and help her grandmother with her pet boarding business. Both characters just felt a bit flat; Hadley had big dreams as a teenager to save the world, help animals but ended up in a very different career yet she never talked about that change. Cam wanted out of town and knew football was his answer but he has a wonderful family so why was he so anxious to leave?  I guess I just felt disconnected from these characters. The other issue was I didn\u2019t feel the heat between them at all, I felt their friendship even at the start when they were in \u201ccompetition\u201d for Hadley\u2019s grandmother\u2019s building, but no sizzle and this has nothing to do with the behind closed door sex scenes, I read a lot of books like that and sometimes the heat between the characters is so hot that the imagination of what goes on behind those doors is smokin\u2019!<br /><br />The town, it\u2019s residents, Tony\u2019s family, Hadley\u2019s friends were all interesting and I felt the series was set up well.

{"rating": 3, "title": "There's a saying...", "text": "You know that statement \"You can never have too much of a good thing\"? Well, you can, and whoever said that clearly never read Tim Curran.<br /><br />I realize I have praised Curran in the past, and I will still praise him for being such an original and twisted author. He writes like no one else and his stories are like no one else's. In a world where increasingly mundane authors are reaching ridiculous amounts of sales for lackluster books, there are still the underground, clever, and much more talented writers who can still pen something that isn't cookie-cutter and the same old story with different names. Thank God that Tim Curran is one of those kind of guys.<br /><br />Like \"Cannibal Corpse\", \"The Hive\" and \"Resurrection\", \"Hag Night\" is pretty much non stop. The action never relents and Curran, being the clever author that he is, always find yet another way to ramp up the violence or the suspense. He can still craft some pretty believable and like-able characters as well. And unlike his other works, you actually liked every character here...well with the exception of Megga, but then again, I think that was pretty well planed as well. The other thing that is clearly evident in all of the author's library, and shown no better than in this one, is the amount of knowledge Curran has for simple things that could otherwise be overlooked. He knows the details of old, 18th century houses, the way life was in those days, and the guy obviously knows his horror films, mentioning bizarre and B-Rated ones that only a true fan of the genre would.<br /><br />Unfortunately (and I just realized I use that word a lot), it's that originality that comes back to bite \"Hag Night.\" Curran has always been known to scribble down some pretty apt descriptions in his novels. Usually many, many, many times, over and over again. I appreciate new ways to describe things and the more crazy and outlandish the better, but sometimes Curran needs to know when to pull in the reigns a bit and just leave some of it up to our own imagination. Like I did with \"Cannibal Corpse\", I'll leave you one of his numerous examples of overwrought illustration:<br /><br />\"She saw the hunched, tenebrous form making its way amongst the moss-covered slabs and leaning headstones, gliding through the blowing snow. It had been a woman before the raves of interment, before the cold and fat dormancy of its sleep. But it was no longer a woman. It was an appetite. And this was its primary motivation, the candle that still burned and flickered in the hollow mortuary of its flesh. It glowed with an even, hungry light like a black taper seen through a frosted window. And it was this hunger that would renew it, temake it, rekindle it's pestilental spirit, transform it from a sculpture of mausoleum dust and drifting web into the semblance of a woman again.\"<br /><br />Now, I'm all for these kinda details...once in a while. Curran puts these things on every page, often times more than once. I don't know how many times the word \"pestilence\" was used, or how frequently we, the readers were told about the vampires red eyes or their desires by \"feasting on brain and organ, shearing skin and chomping down throat meat.\"<br /><br />I'm not gonna say much else about this book or its author. The details are here for you to see. All I'm going to say in closing is that you could do far, far worse in picking an author to read, but don't go for \"Hag Night\" right off the bat.

She can hear everything and is aware of everything that goes on around her. (Now) The backstory is great and I slowly started to realize that something was wrong with both women. (Then) But...<br /><br />The last third of the book does a 180. It literally blows up. Quickly. Everything you thought was true isn\u2019t. The diary entries are written by Claire. (Before) Taylor is Amber. I felt manipulated and angry that I had to reread chapters to understand what the heck is going on. The three stars are for the 2/3 of the book I enjoyed. The suspense was terrific, and it developed in a linear fashion until it all blew up and ruined everything. These psycho women leave a morbid trail behind them.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Classic Reacher--which, I fear, is starting to get cliche.", "text": "Reacher is back in a big-stakes story. That's not necessarily a good thing. Personally, I enjoy the Reacher books where the scope is smaller--local thugs that flaunt their evil just as Reacher happens to be thumbing or Greyhounding through. That's what makes the series for me--it's like Steinbeck's &#34;Travels with Charley&#34; meets Sherlock Holmes. Meets Conan the Barbarian. It's as if David Carradine's character from &#34;Kung Fu&#34; was rewritten for &#34;Wolverine.&#34; The big-scope books like &#34;Without Fail&#34; and the latest, &#34;Personal,&#34; that's where I usually don't buy all of Reacher's omniscient rampaging. Conspiracies with national security, international jet-setting--that's not Reacher. Not to me. Reacher is ultimately a cop. He just happens to be the size of a professional wrestler with the morality of a samurai in the old west. He has the mind, body, and world-view to understand unnecessary evil and know how to deal with it on its own level. Still (fresh from reading it over a 36 hour period), I can't find too much to hate about it. Possibly because Child has given us a new glimpse into Reacher's past that helps us to understand the antihero's POV. And maybe because there's the classic Reacher monstrous villain (Little Joey). Or maybe it's because we get to see Reacher finally using an iPad or texting. Overall, the stakes seem big, but this ends up being a smaller Reacher story. A &#34;Personal&#34; problem (bad dum shh!) Perhaps that's why I didn't mind the fact that he had secret agents, satellite images, and private jets at his disposal to solve this conflict. Most of it is still classic Reacher, which (unfortunately) is starting to fell less fresh--fairly cliche. The next Reacher book down the pipe will be number 20. I hope we can glimpse more into Reacher's past as Personal provided--while viewing Reacher taking care of business in a new way.", "images": [], "asin": "0804178747", "parent_asin": "0804178747", "user_id": "AGHMLAK2IXSXD7QPUB2UDZRJNESA", "timestamp": 1411044245000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "On the Edge of Being Good", "text": "There are so many things that are wrong with Edge of Evil by J.A. Jance that it is difficult to know where to start. However, let me say that it amazes me that the excellent writer who gives us the wonderful JP Beaumont series can turn around and write something as abysmal as this. Granted, her Joanna Brady series, although fun, also lacks the quality of the Beaumont series, which makes me think that maybe Jance should not be writing female characters.<br /><br />Okay, first of all, within the first 10 pages I discovered two continuity errors that slipped by the editors. And I found more than a few typos throughout the book. So count sloppy editing as one strike against the book. Second, the plot itself lacks cohesion. Okay, veteran newscaster Alison Reynolds gets bounced from her job because she is too old. Her stupid husband of 7 years, who is a network bigwig, gets mad because she intends to pursue legal action against the TV station. But that's okay because she suddenly learns that her husband is a real sleazebag and has been cheating on her for years so she files for divorce.<br /><br />But then her best friend from high school goes mysteriously missing and then is found dead, an apparent suicide after receiving a diagnosis of ALS. And although she hasn't seen her friend in at least 2 years, her friend's small children consider her their best friend and unburden themselves to her. And her friend's husband is also a sleazebag who was sleeping around.<br /><br />But the police don't think the death of the friend is suspicious and are happy to accept it as a suicide. And in the meantime, Alison's college-aged, and too wonderful to be true son, sets her up as a blogger, and her blog immediately attracts a huge audience. The topics on her blog roam the gamut from quack treatments for ALS to spousal abuse to scumbag husbands to the stupidity of the TV station for firing her.<br /><br />I could go on- I've only touched the surface of the iceberg in hitting at some of the various plot points (there are more). However, here's my down and dirty summation-- if you want to read a book that hops from one discordant plot point to another and never has any cohesion and expects you to suspend belief on every single page- hey, this is the book for you. However, if that doesn't interest you, find one of Jance's Beaumont books.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Terrific idea, but I wish it was executed better", "text": "I love thoughtful and intelligent Christian fiction, so I was excited by the premise of this book and the rest of Kingdom series.  It promised to be a Pilgrim\u2019s Progress type of allegory, that paralleled events from Genesis to Revelation.  But would it deliver?<br /><br />In the first book, Kingdom\u2019s Dawn, we meet the main characters Leinad and Tess.  After peril arrives when his parents accept gifts from Lucius, they eventually find themselves in slavery, just like Israel in Egypt.<br /><br />The connections with Biblical characters and events in this story are mostly obvious.  Payton & Denin represent Adam and Eve, while other characters drawn from the Bible include Gabrik (angel Gabriel), Lord Fairos (Pharaoh).  Leinad (which is \u201cDaniel\u201d spelled backwards), represents several individuals in the first book, namely Seth, Noah, Abram, Joseph and Moses.  Arrethrae is Terra Earth spelled backwards, and this technique is used for several names (Benreu = Reuben, Eminafs = Famine), and the Vactor Deluge parallels the Great Flood.  And if you can\u2019t figure the connections for yourself, the back of the book has some commentary explaining everything, including the significance of Cedric (believers from Peter to present), Tess (faithful remnant that believes prophets), and of course Leinad (Old Testament prophets from Seth to Malachi).<br /><br />Does it work?  Sadly I don\u2019t think so.  I enjoy thoughtful allegory, but it needs to be done carefully and well, and that\u2019s not the case here.  The comparisons are just too obvious, that it no longer is a story of its own.  What\u2019s more, the allusions to Biblical characters and events are often cheesy, the use of reversed names being a case in point.  Cheesy dialogue like \"good morning sunshine\" clashes with serious subject matter.  At one point Leinad and Tess hug, and it all feels more like a cheap romance, rather than a serious story.  There are questions and answers at the end, which encourage you to engage with the ideas being allegorized, but these only serve to show that the story can\u2019t really speak for itself, but needs commentary.<br /><br />To the author\u2019s credit, he appears to have used a thesaurus to include some big words.  But quite frankly he\u2019s not a strong writer, and he often makes the mistake of telling us what happens, rather than describe and show it.  As a result there is no sense of immersion in the story, and it\u2019s just poor story-telling at best.<br /><br />In the end, the concept is clever, but it\u2019s just poorly executed.  Unfortunately the story often seems overly childish and cheese, and lacks real literary value, despite the attempt to allegorize important truths.  The result is that it diminishes and cheapens the important spiritual message it is trying to communicate.  Sadly, this is a bad example of Christian fiction, I won\u2019t be reading any more in this series, and can\u2019t recommend it.  Instead, read the Narnia Chronicles or Pilgrim\u2019s Progress.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Neighbors", "text": "In so many ways Ed Andrews' personal story of mortgage disaster was both more and less than I expected. Busted: Life Inside the Great Mortgage Meltdown presents the embarrassing story of a New York Times economic reporter's personal financial and personal crises of the last few years. One would expect that an educated and informed person would have averted predatory loans and would not have spent so far beyond one's means, but we humans are complicated, and Andrews' story is like that of many others. He divorced, and faced increased expenses by adding his own housing expenses. He remarried, and his costs increased further. Both he and his new wife were reckless with spending and never quite found a productive way of talking about money and spending. For readers who love schadenfreude, Busted will be very satisfying. For fans of reality television, this print version of Cribs might be entertaining. For any reader who wonders about what kind of people get themselves into financial muddles, Andrews and his wife offer some answers but little sympathy because of their selfishness, immaturity and overall recklessness. If these people are our neighbors, the neighborhood is in trouble.<br /><br />Rating: Two-star (Mildly Recommended)", "images": [], "asin": "0393067947", "parent_asin": "0393067947", "user_id": "AG473D27NAWRW3N2RMWVYZ6ICBTA", "timestamp": 1246548576000, "helpful_vote": 19, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

After all, is Idina Sackville a particularly interesting character?  I think not.  She struck me as a dime-a-dozen hedonist and degenerate, who managed to convince herself that her lifestyle was sophisticated and worldly, when it was in fact empty and ghastly.  If she were around today, she'd be appearing in amateur porno movies and posting them on the Internet.  And the same is true of the whole Happy Valley set.  What base and dreary people.<br /><br />If Osborne had taken a more jaundiced approach, she might have succeeded in painting a deservedly acid portrait of these upper-crust vulgarians.  Instead, Osborne has allowed her blood relationship with Idina to corrupt her as a writer.  Osborne's portrayal of her relative and the tiresome creeps in her orbit has been romanticized; worse -- softened, sweetened, and sentimentalized to a sickly degree.  Quick, somebody, an insulin shot!<br /><br />An excellent book on these delusional dolts is \"White Mischief\", by James Fox, which focuses on the fascinating mystery of the murder of Lord Erroll.

I mean, that's how Brockmann set it up.  I had received the book the day before I read the reviews.  I was furious that Brockmann decided to change the tide.  I wanted to return the book immediately.  Well, I got distracted and didn't get to the book for a few days and so I got over my initial anger.<br /><br />Well, I ended up reading the book.  I can't say I wasn't disappointed.  Although Brockmann made a good effort of rearranging everything we had hitherto read about Deck, Sophia, and Dave I was left feeling kind of blah.  Yeah, the way she wrote it went okay, but the fact that she changed our perception of Deck, Tracy, Dave and Sophia by rearranging their personalities didn't fly true with me.  I couldn't get over waiting for Dave to do something completely geeky or for Tracy to do something completely dumb blondish.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that Brockmann chose to represent the characters one way in previous books, then changed their characters to show different personalities. I realize it is a work of fiction, but the reason most of us read these types of books is for the realism that is represented.  When things go way beyond reality (i.e. completely changing your IQ and personality), the book and author loses credibility.<br /><br />Does this mean I will no longer read Brockmann books? No.  But I feel like if it happens again, I might go looking elsewhere for my thrills.  I love the troubleshooter series.  I've read EVERY one.

Bottom line,  I love this book -- have read it (and listened to it) at least eight or nine times and I'm not done yet.  It's my turn-to book when I want the comfort of reading something I know I love.<br /><br />So why two stars?  I bought this particular book for a young friend who doesn't read all that much - she's the &#34;Why are you giving me a book?  I already have one&#34; kind of person.  But I thought that if ever there was a book that would hook her from the first page, that she would glory in, identify with, day in, day out, this would be it.  How could anyone not love, not revel in, the tale of Frannie's incredible life?<br /><br />Sorry to tell you, that didn't happen -- and I'm still convinced the problem is this particular edition.  The book itself is very thick  -- which I personally love, but which scared the bejesus out of my young friend.  But compounding that, the print is SO TINY!!  Why would a publisher do that?  Put WIDE margins on the pages, and make the print so small even I  -- 20-20 vision! -- had to struggle with it?<br /><br />The result?  It's an intimidating-looking book: so many pages, such little bitty tiny small print. If I'd SEEN this edition myself, I'd never have bought it for my friend -- I could see right away that this would look was too formidable for a non-compulsive reader, no matter how good the story itself was.<br /><br />Too bad, too bad.

I didn't learned anything, I am afraid, and was irritated at times when I disagreed with authors opinion that was being passed off as facts.<br /><br />What bothered me the most is the lack of rigor, for instance, he advocates for incremental design which costs 10-20% and if you don't it will make you 10%-20% slower after some point.  The only motivation a graph with no units.  It may matter if is 10% or 20%, as that is after all a factor of 2.  Also, it's not really clear that once in a while 10% investment, let's call it 45 minutes is a very different cost than a recurring daily 45 minute overhead due to cost being a mess.  I don't have any data to dispute the numbers, btw, but on the other hand, I have not seen any studies to support it either, and the author does not tell us where he is getting this from.<br /><br />His advise of avoiding lots of small functions as it means you will be bouncing all over the place to understand the code is not necessarily wrong.  It adds lots of boiler plate, for example. Using an argument from the book itself, however, you could argue that good names and comments would mean you didn't need to read those lower level functions.  The counter argument is that smaller functions are much easier to unit test.  Then you have the unit test vs integration test discussion of course.<br /><br />There are 3 chapters on comments.  Why?!  I am towards the \"good code is self-documenting\" end of the spectrum, although I would  say a lot of comments is often (but certainly not always) a code smell that suggest refactoring using better names, extracting code to function etc.  I do like how he describes good comments as either lower or higher level than the code.<br /><br />The text editor example that runs through most of the book becomes trite.

A quick read about a Halloween hotspot that turns deadly, you get gruesome deaths, a menacing masked murderer, angsty final girls and a quiet town rocked by tragedy. It\u2019s straight-forward without much depth, but neither are any of our favorite horror films or books centered on the concept of a night of terror. I came for the scares, the screams and the quick pacing and Ihli delivered.<br /><br />The book gives us multiple perspectives from a victim, a group of girlfriends and the killer. Many of our characters are angsty teens\u2014 emotional and horny and up to such antics like brooding over boys, drinking and gossiping. Given the slasher formula, they are doomed. A couple of them have their head on a bit straighter than others\u2014including Norah, who is grieving her brother\u2019s death. It\u2019s fun to predict who may or may not survive. We also get into the head of our killer. I don\u2019t always love when this happens because I think it takes the scare factor down a notch. Once we are in his head it humanizes him and he becomes less scary. I loved the concept of a haunted forest/camp site turned deadly. It\u2019s the perfect setting for a horror story and Ihli does a great job of setting up the scenes with vivid details.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Maybe a Little Too Wholesome", "text": "After reading \"A Brilliant Night of Stars and Ice\" (2022) by this author whom I'd never read anything or heard of before now, I was looking forward to enjoying this book, one of her earlier works which was published in 2018. However, this weak plot was all wrapped up by chapter 14 (there are 21 chapters total) and by that point, for this reader, this book was very much over. This is the first in what is supposed to be a fun, lighthearted even whimsical series about a group of single women who get married off, one by one.<br /><br />It did start off promising.<br /><br />A large group of mostly forgettable single women, way past their expiration date for the time period in which it is set, 1815, London England who publish articles about their experiences in the local papers. Except for the main heroine of this novel, Georgiana Allen (Georgie) all of her single friends and fellow Spinsters \"with a capital S\" were hard to root for or follow thanks to all the stereotypes this book couldn't seem to get away from. There's a \"shy\" spinster, a \"play the field having too much fun to commit\" spinster, a \"plain and homely\" spinster...You get it. And it seemed on every single page one of these women was either: scoffing, smirking, hiding a laugh in her sleeve, choking back a laugh, groaning, snorting or huffing as they discussed their single state with each other, the lack of eligible men and usually doing so with the only male character of any importance in this book, Captain Anthony Sterling. Naturally, Tony is your typical romantic novel male who never looked at another woman in his life until he saw our heroine.<br /><br />One of Tony's friends wants him to break up the Spinsters, they are throwing off the groove of all the carefree bachelors who don't want to settle and commit. These wholesome women must be stopped! If Tony were to get into their inner circle, get the ringleader Georgie to fall in love with him, then all the eligible maidens in Society would again be fair game for the single men to pursue without the cynical, rain-on-our-parade influence of these old maids who, nevertheless, hold a place of general respect in upper-class Society with their opinions and articles. Not a bad story idea by the author but even a 21st century reader knows such women have NEVER held such a place in culture or society. Childless women who have never married achieve their fame by CHOOSING such a life, which was unheard of in 1815 and these women are most certainly NOT single and childless by choice. They just haven't found a husband yet and are the victims of skewed numbers in the dating circles of their day. Even today, such women never make headlines, are treated like second-class citizens and largely ignored and forgotten by everyone. I'm speaking from personal experience here.<br /><br />This explains why this book by an LDS author was NOT published by Deseret Book or Covenant like \"Brilliant Night\" was. Not sure exactly why, maybe because of the weak plot and story idea, maybe the fact one character dropped the forbidden \"D\" word, the only place in the book I noticed while reading-sorry I can't find the reference. Or perhaps when Georgie and Tony realized they couldn't swipe left and hold out for their nine or ten to come along and decided to get together that they couldn't stop sneaking off into corners to steal kisses and passionate embraces. Nothing offensive, don't worry it was all good, clean wholesome fun but, again, just not as well written as \"Brilliant Night\" which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Pick this up if you need something to read but I recommend waiting for this author's next book to come out as published and edited by more professional houses than the one this came from.", "images": [], "asin": "1943048533", "parent_asin": "1943048533", "user_id": "AHAFU3RWXWOER3FFHPVAEE22IZFQ", "timestamp": 1676395711397, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 2}

Although it contains a very thorough overview of the political and diplomatic relations of the two countries from 1947 to 1979, analysing many issues ranging from the Chinese community in Vietnam to the US-Chinese and Soviet-Vietnamese relations, the actual military operations of the war are covered in only 16 pages of a single chapter (number 5). The writing is also completely dry, reminding official diplomatic report. For someone who's looking for a better military account I would recommend \"PLA Warfighting\" which is much more detailed on the subject, and also \"Brother Enemy\" by Nayan Chanda which has an easily read narrative, albeit it focuses on the Vietnam invasion of Cambodia (December 1978 - January 1979).", "images": [], "asin": "0817985719", "parent_asin": "0817985719", "user_id": "AFY5AYN6BDZBALVVV66HJVO3BHSQ", "timestamp": 1107774466000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

I didn't want to read about other people, I wanted Chris's story. And what we actually get of his story is fascinating and riveting. I just wish we got more of it.<br /><br />I was also perplexed by how many times we got references to Chris's camera and journal, but the entire book is without photos (save one in the very beginning) and almost nothing from the journal (though we get to read a handful of postcard messages and letters). But upon further research, it seems that Chris's family plans to release another book that will include some photos and other material. Why they weren't included in this book puzzles me. I don't want to believe that the family is using this poor kid's tragic story as a money-making machine, but with multiple magazine articles, a book, a film, and another book on the way... one has to wonder. Chris, after all, wasn't especially close to his family.<br /><br />I would much rather have had a book filled with photos and journal entries, than Krakauer's confusing, wandering tales that jump back and forth in time (we begin the story with Chris's death? why isn't that at the end?). The timeline of the book is so jumbled that I had trouble keeping track of what was happening, where it was, when it was.<br /><br />So this book gets 3 stars from me.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The 'big reveal' was disappointing.", "text": "Liane Moriarty is a popular best-selling author and her latest book, Truly Madly Guilty, garnered a lot of hype and many good reviews. That said, the book was just okay for me.<br /><br />Set in Sydney, Australia, the story is about an unfortunate incident that occurs during a backyard barbeque. The cookout's hosts are Vid and Tiffany - a rich sociable couple that live in a luxurious home with their 10-year-old daughter Dakota. The guests include the hosts' next-door neighbors Erika and Oliver and their friends Clementine and Sam who bring their two little girls Holly (5) and Ruby (2). The story skips back and forth in time, depicting events before the barbeque, on the day of the barbeque, and after the barbeque.<br /><br />As the story unfolds we learn the backstories of some of the characters. Erika had a difficult shame-filled childhood with her mother Sylvia, a narcissistic and delusional hoarder. Feeling bad for Erika, Clementine's mother Pam took the girl under her wing and pushed Clementine to be friends with her - which Clementine resented. Erika's husband Oliver also had a dysfunctional childhood, with two alcoholic parents. Thus Erika and Oliver - both damaged - understand each other and have a quiet successful marriage.<br /><br />Clementine, by contrast, had a happy childhood.....aside from being irritated by Erika's constant presence. Clementine had loving parents, a nice home, and musical talent that was nurtured by her family. Clementine is now a professional cellist, happily married to public relations honcho Sam. Though Clementine and Sam's lives are somewhat fraught - with two small kids, two careers, and Clementine's constant fretting about auditions - the couple meanders along quite happily.<br /><br />Vid is an electrician who resembles 'Tony Soprano' and Tiffany is a successful property developer with an eye-catching sexy figure. Tiffany unashamedly admits she once worked as a pole dancer to make money for school. The couple enjoy throwing parties and Vid loves to cook - so he serves tasty dishes from recipes he finds on the internet. (I got a yen to try some of his dishes....ha ha ha.)<br /><br />On the day of the barbeque tension arises early because Erika and Oliver make a request of Clementine and Sam that throws the couple off-kilter. So it's not surprising that there's a little too much drinking and hilarity at the cookout, leading to an unfortunate occurrence. A good part of the book drops hints about the incident at the barbeque, details the emotions and actions of the characters, and relates consequences after the cookout. I have to say - after the HUGE build-up - I found the 'barbeque incident' rather predictable and mundane, and the consequences overblown and unrealistic.<br /><br />That said there are things I like about the story. It has some clever surprises and twists, and some memorable characters and scenes. For example, Sylvia the hoarder (Erika's mom) is sly, phony, funny....and VERY irritating. And social worker Pam (Clementine's mom) is overly self-righteous in her do-gooding, interfering zeal. At one point Pam gives a dinner party speech that made me (and the book's characters) quite uncomfortable. These behaviors - though squirm inducing - add interest to the story. On the other hand, 5-year-old Holly is a hoot when she sprinkles her conversation with &#34;air quotes&#34; on random words.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the book held my attention, after which I was slightly bored. And the story's final scenes didn't ring true to me. I would mildly recommend this book to fans of Liane Moriarty but it's not as good as her earlier work (IMO).", "images": [], "asin": "1250069793", "parent_asin": "1250069793", "user_id": "AHNZRQNJHNSBVKERNXSWNLKOZ6YQ", "timestamp": 1472520246000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

This is the fault of the editor that let his prose, which is rambling and repetitive, be published as is. This is especially true for the chapters on Sartre. It might have been the result of Copleston\u2019s age, for the last chapter is weak, which is unfortunate, since Merleau-Ponty is widely studied today.  Also, the short biography of Albert Camus has errors. Camus was indeed a member of the French Communist Party but was expelled as a result of his sympathy for absurdism and anarchism. He joined several anarchist movements but refused to explain philosophically or rationally the meanings of absurdism or anarchism.

This book, beyond any doubt, has more copy-editing and typesetting errors than any book I have read in print.  Ever!  At one point, I decided to take notes and filled two pages by the time I was done with the book.  Most of the spelling errors were easy to correct, but took a human to do it -- not an automatic spell-checker.  For example, during one of the orgy sequences, \"Roman\" is substituted for \"Ramon\" (when the author obviously intends a reference to Ramon Navarro and not Roman Polanski).  A more serious error involves how the actor Todd Pickett came to hook up with the surgeon who performed botched plastic surgery.  There are two divergent accounts with screwed-up time frames regarding appointments, one that seems to take place before and one after the death of a beloved pet. Obviously, Mr. Barker had done some rewriting here and had forgotten to change what came earlier.  No one else seemed to pick up on this.  The story is enjoyable, with certain similarities to \"Weaveworld,\" but the constant errors are annoying and would deserve a better rating than I have given it if someone (the author? the editor? the copy editor?) had shown enough concern to read through the galleys with a red pencil BEFORE the book was published.", "images": [], "asin": "0060182970", "parent_asin": "0060182970", "user_id": "AETING54V2SMNR3RFNXUY2VCWWQQ", "timestamp": 1034008876000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

She\u2019s also obsessed with the boy who gets paired as her partner, so she doesn\u2019t want to stop working with him.<br /><br />The beginning of the book opened with a prologue that I was really intrigued by, but then the book never really answered what happened with the prologue and never touched on it again \u2013 it seemed like it was forgotten, and I found myself wishing more of the book was like the intense prologue!<br /><br />I found the way some of the characters acted to be unrealistic. Vee\u2019s parents grounded her for something that was important, but the dumbest reason to ground someone. It seemed like a really bad reaction to the event, and made me dislike Vee\u2019s parents.<br /><br />I also hated how many of Vee\u2019s actions revolved around a boy. She gets in a fight with her best friend over a boy, enters the game because of a boy, chooses not to quit the game because of a boy, and so on and so forth. I wanted to shake her and tell her to form her own identity and NOT make it wrapped up in men! You\u2019re worth more than that!<br /><br />That said, I hated the epilogue. WHY was it necessary for this book to end on a \u201ccliffhanger\u201d? It could easily have been wrapped up, and it left me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed by this one. It was a lot of stupid people making idiotic decisions in order to win money and prizes. I felt like the author WANTED to make it like The Hunger Games, but fell way way short.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Pre-Storyville", "text": "New Orleans certainly boasts a colorful history, what with Andrew Jackson and pirate Jean Lafitte teaming to defeat the British at the close of the War of 1812 (actually after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed, so technically after the war had ended), the city constantly battling the encroachment of Gulf waters, and, the subject of this book, the confinement of prostitution and bordellos to a red-light district. While many cities have had formal red-light districts (and some still do, like Amsterdam and many German cities), New Orleans\u2019 version has always held a sort of romantic appeal, perhaps because of its nickname, \u201cStoryville,\u201d or that it is way back in history.<br /><br />Lynn and Martin attempt to resurrect the period, really 1898, the time leading up to the inauguration of the district, by novelizing the life of a young prostitute. While interesting and definitely portraying the misery that was (and is) street prostitution, it\u2019s never as compelling as you might expect a novel on this topic to be. Truth be told, it\u2019s kind of flat. Lynn and Martin might have done better by shortening the build-up to the instituting of the district and lengthening the portion devoted to the district.<br /><br />In fact, there was a real Mary Deubler, the central character. She, however, wasn\u2019t nearly as downtrodden and hapless as her novelized version. She proved a quite shrewd entrepreneurial type who did operate a house called the Arlington, who even in short biographical sketches sounds intriguing. Probably many of the characters who have basis in history, like Tom Anderson and Lulu White, were more interesting than as Lynn and Martin portray them. Which highlights the weakness of their novelized approach, weak characterizations.<br /><br />In the end, Madam isn\u2019t really the place to seek out information about or titillation from Storyville.

Greater Expectations is a romantic comedy book told through the view of a male called only as &#34;Z&#34;.

But, as the book moved on we read as &#34;Z&#34; started to hook back into the dating game and we read of all his up's and downs in the dating world. What was interesting as a reader is that this book is all told through the male perspective and we get a glimpse into the relationship basics of what it's like through the guy's eyes. I do admit being a female and reading this book in parts was quite difficult as the humor was definitely guy's humor and I was like hmmm, ok that's just cringeworthy and not worth talking about e.g jerking off etc. But overall, it was an eye-opener reading this book and glancing from the male's point of view and also written by a male as in the world of romance fiction, it is very rare to have a book with this content written by a male author.<br /> So readers, if you are wanting the &#34;LAD&#34; point of view on relationships and wanting to catch a glimpse of what goes on in your guy's head , then check out Greater Expectations by Alexander McCabe and you will not be disappointed.", "images": [], "asin": "B00MGAQTE8", "parent_asin": "B00MGAQTE8", "user_id": "AHKVAYJF4Q6KU5WOCXNBBUYG34MA", "timestamp": 1424222835000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

The story focuses on four siblings and their various reactions to a prophecy of their death days. It brings to question destiny and if you can change the outcome or if its all self-fulfilling prophecies. Nothing is fully answered or even discussed, just briefly mentioned.<br />It was interesting to see the various reactions to their noted death days. Especially since we were never told how they would die it made you question did their choices lead to death or they would have died regardless. Overall though, I didn\u2019t really care about any of the characters. The first two stories being the least interesting made it even more of a struggle. Bits and pieces were interesting but their overall lives were very boring to me. Even the side characters were rather dull and added very little to the overall story.<br />Something I absolutely hated, the random sexualized text. The story opens with a thirteen year old being introduced by the status of her pubic hair. Another scene adult Klara is skinny dipping and her \u201cpubic hair blooms\u201d before she dives in.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Introduction to the Calculus - Herstein, Sandler", "text": "My earlier aquaintence with I.N. Herstein is through his Topics in Algebra (1964, 2nd edition 1975) which was my first encounter with abstract algebra. In 1971, Herstein's Introduction to Calculus was published, written with Reuben Sandler. There were no further editions. This is not a typical calculus textbook and I wonder how popular it was in its day. The book is cramped and plodding, verbose and tedious. Their intentions, however, were admirable enough.<br /><br />\"There has been a tendency in the last 10-15 years to do the calculus for the beginner in a completely formal, rigorous, and - to our minds - stilted way. This preoccupation with detail and technique of proof, rather than with the basic ideas involved, have made a dark mystery out of concepts which are essentially clear and simple. The student, unaware of the basic direction of the subject, confuses the detail of rigorizing an argument with the fundamental ideas being developed. In consequence, the average student, upon finishing his first year of calculus, has neither a full and coherent picture of what the subject is about, nor a mature understanding of mathematical technique and rigor. His ability to use the reasoning and results of the calculus - and let's never forget that the calculus was devised to handle large classes of problems in and out of mathematics - unfortunately is too limited by this formalistic approach.<br /><br />\"Our motivation for writing this book is a desire to fight this recent trend. In this we are certainly not the first - in recent years a fine attempt in this direction was made by Serge Lang. It should be pointed out that the calculus was taught unrigorously for the largest part of this century; unrigorously, but, unfortunately, too often sloppily. One can give an intuitive approach to the subject which is honest and correct without being sloppy, if one limits one's attention to well-behaved functions. Fortunately, such well-behaved functions exist in abundance and are, in fact, the functions that arise in the basic material of mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, and many other fields.<br /><br />\"We have tried to be completely intuitive and to motivate the various ideas and concepts introduced. But there are times when one must get down to the fine points of an argument in order to give an honest presentation.... All in all, we have tried to keep a uniformly intuitive approach, paying as little heed to formalism and rigor as possible without distorting matters.\"<br /><br />That \"fine attempt\" by Serge Lang has faired far better than the effort of Herstein and Sandler. Lang's calculus books (his \"First Course\" was already in a 2nd edition by 1971) are enduring classics and still in print. Others from that period, and still going strong, include texts by Salas and Hille, George Thomas, Thomas Apostol, and Michael Spivak.<br /><br />This book by Herstein and Sandler is probably nobody's idea of a classic. They essentially talk you through single-variable calculus. Their approach is to pretend to discover the methods of calculus through \"intuition\" and futzing about. The book is laid out in block paragraphs cluttered with mathematical notation without any offsetting emphasis of formulas, theorems, or especially significant information. With extremely few exceptions, every bit of mathematics in this book is written within the linear confines of a prose sentence embedded within a multi-sentence paragraph. The page layout in this book is annoying.<br /><br />Here's what the blurb on the dust jacket says: \"This text presents a short, intuitive treatment of the one-variable calculus. The approach, although careful and honest, does not emphasize rigor, but instead makes great use of heuristic arguments. In preference to the theorem-proof format, plausibility arguments that easily convert into formal proofs are described in a smooth, free-flowing narrative style. Analytic geometry is presented through examples rather than formal presentations. Key points are summarized at the end of each section. In the last chapter, the notion of limits is rigorously defined and used to give proofs of the more important theorems found earlier in the book and to indicate a general way of rendering rigorous the subject matter of calculus.\"<br /><br />I came upon a second-hand copy of this in a local bookstore and bought it, despite the cluttered blocks of text I saw on the pages, because of a good price and Herstein's name on the cover. I thought it'd be okay. His algebra book does alright. But getting the book out recently and trying to read it, I find after little less than 60 pages, and some impatient skimming ahead, that I simply cannot endure it any longer. I do not recommend this book.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Doesn't exactly soar", "text": "Having just enjoyed \"Hawk Quest\", by Robert Lyndon, I allowed myself to be lured into ordering another falconry-centric historical fiction Vine selection. Unfortunately, this is one book I'll have to cut loose and whistle down the wind.<br /><br />Unlike Lyndon, author Katia Fox knows little or nothing about falconry. My husband is a fireman, and he refuses to watch firefighting-themed movies because they're so annoyingly unrealistic. That's how I felt when I started reading this book. The main character, William, rescues a falcon that has been injured while trying to subdue its prey. William is a young kid who gathers up the falcon in his cloak, sneaks it home and hides it in an outbuilding, where he treats the bird's injuries. All with no training, no equipment, no knowledge of animal husbandry (or maybe this was established in the first part of this series, which I haven't read). We are introduced to a falcon as tame and harmless as a golden retriever puppy.<br /><br />The characters are flat and predictable. The dialogue is stilted. The author would have greatly benefited from an editor willing to ruthlessly cut away some of the overblown language and pare this book down by at least 200 pages.<br /><br />I like accurate historical fiction, and I think this particular series could have been a great introduction to 12th Century England, especially for a young person who thinks history is boring and overrated.

{"rating": 1, "title": "This book is ultimately not very instructive about just war - Fourth Edition: Terrible wine in a new bottle", "text": "At a lecture at West Point United States Military Academy April 6, 2006, Naom Chomsky argued, &#34;Just war theory&#34; literature &#34;deserves special attention but is ultimately not very instructive about just war&#34;. &#34;Just war theory&#34; is &#34;declarations of personal preference&#34;, which &#34;never tells you anything. It doesn't tell you when it is proper to intervene, what it tells you is 'I think it is proper to intervene'...there is a big gap between assertion and argument, between surmise and evidence.&#34; &#34;We learn very little about just war from 'Just war theory'&#34; what we do learn is &#34;mostly about the prevailing moral and intellectual climate in which we live.&#34; Walzer's book relies crucially on such premises as &#34;Seems to me entirely justified, or I believe, or no doubt.&#34; Chomsky then discusses scientific studies on human behavior which is noticeably absent from Walzer's book.<br /><br />Walzer uses the term &#34;I think&#34; at least 52 times in the book. &#34;I don't think&#34; 7 times. &#34;I believe&#34; twice, &#34;no doubt&#34; at least 41 times, and &#34;seems to me&#34; 12 times (I write &#34;at least&#34; because the same phrase twice on one page would be counted once.)<br /><br />Walzer's hypocricy<br /><br />In a book which suffers from terribly bad organization, on page 62 Walzer finally systematically lays out his arguments, stating that &#34;Once the agressor state has been militarily repulsed, it can also be punished.&#34;<br /><br />On December 29, 2005, in an interview on NPR Morning Edition ('Just and Unjust Wars' Author Critical on Iraq.) Walzer stated that the Iraq war was not a just war:<br /><br />&#34;If you are going to use military force in someone else's county...There has to be a cause of some urgency, a massacre in progress. A massacre in memory is not a just cause.&#34;<br /><br />Therefore, if you follow Walzer's assertions to its obvious conclusion, the Iraq war was not a just war and therefore &#34;the agressor state&#34;, the US, should &#34;be punished.&#34;<br /><br />But Walzer signed and endorsed The Euston Manifesto, which states in part:<br /><br />&#34;We are also united in the view that, since the day on which this occurred, the proper concern of genuine liberals and members of the Left should have been the battle to put in place in Iraq a democratic political order and to rebuild the country's infrastructure...rather than picking through the rubble of the arguments over intervention.&#34;<br /><br />Therefore in Just and unjust wars, Walzer argues that &#34;agressor states&#34; should be &#34;punished&#34; but yet Walzer signs a document which criticize those who &#34;pick through the rubble of the arguments over intervention.&#34;<br /><br />Although the Iraq War is not covered in this book, Walzer's inconsistent views on the Iraq war should give serious students of International affairs pause before subscribing to his arguments. It is one mans opinion, full of statments such as &#34;Seems to me entirely justified&#34; &#34;I believe&#34; or &#34;no doubt.&#34;<br /><br />Walzer's arguments are unscientific rablings of one intellectual which are &#34;ultimately not very instructive about just war&#34;.", "images": [], "asin": "0465037070", "parent_asin": "0465037070", "user_id": "AGEVNWIXLQ3OU3MKYE6QIBE4XT3A", "timestamp": 1410095105000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 3, "title": "A bit disappointing when compared to The Chosen One", "text": "I had extremely high hopes for Miles From Ordinary considering that I loved The Chosen One.  That book was deep, shocking, and heartwrenching.  I remember sobbing for a half hour after I finished The Chosen One about three hours after I started it.  I expected the same thing from Miles From Ordinary and ultimately, I ended up a tad bit disappointed.<br /><br />I'm going to start out by saying that Miles From Ordinary starts out sloooowwww, like really, really, really slow.  It took me about three days to get through the first 50 pages.  It just didn't hook me at first and I kept wanting to put it down.  It was like pulling teeth for me.  Sure, it was mildly interesting, but I guess there was a disconnect between me and the protagonist that prevented me from making any true headway until after the initial 60 or so pages.<br /><br />That's another issue I had with Miles from Ordinary.  The voice of the protagonist was a bit...off.  She seemed a bit on the juvenile side even for thirteen.  I kept forgetting she was thirteen and thinking she was about ten or eleven.  I understand that dealing with her mentally ill mother must have stunted her growth a bit, but I just expect a thirteen year old to be a little bit more...aware than Lacey was.  Oh, and I totally didn't buy (mild spoiler here) the whole thing with Linda not being able to help Lacey because the mom kept kicking her out.  If Linda had made a big deal about not wanting Lacey to be with her mom because of her initial depression, chances are Child Protective Services would've gotten involved.  Maybe they wouldn't have initially snatched the child, but it would've been enough of an issue to have them, at the very least, make an unannounced visit to check out that everything was fine.  That, of course, would've proved that everything wasn't fine and Linda would've had a good chance to keep Lacey. (end of mild spoiler)<br /><br />Besides my issues with the book, I do have to say that the last 40 pages or so of Miles From Ordinary were filled with tension.  In fact, the last chapters were absolutely terrifying.  I really felt for Lacey there and have no idea how she managed to keep semi-calm because there's no way in hell I would've been calm.  I would have been freaking out immensely.  So, all in all, I thought that Miles From Ordinary was just okay.  It didn't compare at all to The Chosen One and was a bit uneven.

The textbook's authors seem to have some kind of a mania grandiosa because they print their own analysis and commentary in a font that is much larger than the font in which the excerpts from Lope, Cervantes, Galdos, Goytisolo, and other Spanish authors are printed. As a result, it looks as if excerpts from actual works of literature were some kind of an afterthought to the ideas of Perez Rivera and Hurtado.

{"rating": 3, "title": "I'm totally on the fence about this one.", "text": "So it has taken me a bit to gather my thoughts enough to review Grey by E.L. James, which if you didn\u2019t know is Fifty Shades Of Grey told from the male leads POV, Christian Grey.<br />I was really interested in this retelling of the original story to see if there was much of a difference from the story we all know and if it\u2019s been altered a bit since the recent movie. I was also interested in seeing how the authors writing style may have matured since the original as well. Lastly, I wanted to see if there were more details into Christian\u2019s childhood or backstory that we didn\u2019t get in the first telling. So here\u2019s my review and a bit of a synopsis.<br />Christian Grey is a man obsessed. A man who is in control of his world. That is until Anna Steel crashes into his office and into his life. She is an innocent and definitely not in control of anything. The two will embark on a journey of discovery; in and out of the bedroom and only their willingness to be together and bend their own rules can love prevail.<br />This book is a cliffy, so be warned. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you haven\u2019t read the original Fifty but let me say this, if you haven\u2019t read Fifty, you could pick this one up as a standalone, seriously! Even though it\u2019s a cliffy, it does wrap up nicely. A newbie could walk away with having sampled a taste and know that the two will ultimately be together.<br />Anywho with that being said, I did like hearing the story from his POV. I personally prefer male POV\u2019s much more then female. I like the darkness of them verses the usual light and fluffy female telling. I also liked hearing him cuss and call her sweetheart and baby in his head, it was a much more endearing telling of the same story verses her take. You walk away from the story understanding his stalker-ish tendencies a bit more and how she becomes a lifeline for him, only to completely screw the pooch and cut the line by hurting her and how it takes him finally bending his ways and deciding rather then fit her into his life, he needs to fit into hers. He tries so hard in the first book to make her into what he needs that he ultimately loses her until he realizes through therapy that rather then make her into what he needs, he should try the opposite and try to be what she needs, which I don\u2019t think came across in the movie or in the first book. So I did love seeing that POV of the story.<br />What I didn\u2019t like was that we didn\u2019t really get much more of his past. We got some scene snippets and we do feel the heartbreak of an abused child but I really didn\u2019t feel like it added to the story as much as I had hoped. Granted, I don\u2019t want to relive his childhood through the book but I didn\u2019t feel that much more was gained through the scenes that I didn\u2019t know about from the first telling. Also, I felt it was basically the EXACT same story but with a male slant, if that makes sense? Scene for scene, it follows the original Fifty except with a build up or interjection of his life.<br />I'm not sure if it's worth the read or if it added much that you didn't already know. I'm totally on the fence about this one. Check out what I said above and if you want the new slant on an old store, give it a shot. If this is new to you, give it a shot.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Fascinating wilderness world, but ultimately this story frustrated me", "text": "This might be the first time where I picked up a book that a few of my SF&F blogger friends enjoyed... and didn't like it as much as they did. Which is a bummer, because Sarah Beth Durst does a few things quite well in THE QUEEN OF BLOOD. I just wish its weaknesses hadn't frustrated me so much.<br /><br />THE QUEEN OF BLOOD is the first book in a YA/adult crossover epic fantasy series that features malevolent nature spirits, human youths (mostly girls, but also the occasional boy) who can control these spirits, and queens who are skilled in this practice and chosen by the spirits to keep the tenuous peace between nature and humanity. Daleina is one such candidate for this honor. At age 10, her village is destroyed in a spirit attack, and her powers manifest for the first time as she saves her family. The horrors she endured spur her to join one of Aratay's academies later on so she can protect her people. But as Daleina grows older and learns to harness her powers, spirit attacks like the one her village suffered continue to plague Aratay. Who's behind these attacks? Is Queen Fara losing her sway over the nature spirits? Most frightening of all, what if the attacks aren't accidents at all?<br /><br />For me, the two dominant strengths of THE QUEEN OF BLOOD are worldbuilding and plot. The best word to describe the forest realm of Aratay is &#34;wilderness.&#34; It's inhabited yet untamed, dangerous and beautiful. Its people are closely tied to the land and the spirits they co-exist with. Entire villages and cities are constructed in gigantic trees. The lore of the nature spirits and the overall way of the world is demonstrated quite well without info-dumping, so it's easy to become immersed in Aratay's happenings.<br /><br />As for the plot, it seems fairly straightforward until the second half - and then HOLY PLOT TWISTS. This story serves turn after turn as it closes in on the end, and the suspense mounts to the point where you absolutely NEED to know how it ends. I did predict one of the plot twists correctly (it's easy to guess who's behind the spirit attacks), but the others... Wow. I did not see them coming, and they make for a fitting yet unexpectedly brutal ending.<br /><br />The characters of THE QUEEN OF BLOOD, though... I did like Daleina a lot. She's far from any &#34;chosen one&#34; or &#34;special snowflake&#34; trope. Rather, she's one of the weaker students in her academy magic-wise, but she compensates for it with courage, determination, and an enviable work ethic. Her motivations are noble, too; she's more concerned about her family and the welfare of Aratay's people than power or prestige. But the other characters... Apart from Ven, I don't feel like I got to know them very well. The other academy students seemed too similar and blended into one another by the end, and Queen Fara was a stereotypical corrupted queen-seductress-madwoman.<br /><br />I also wasn't that impressed by the writing in THE QUEEN OF BLOOD. Durst certainly knows how to build a believable world and plot an exciting story. But for a fantasy novel that's meant to appeal to both YA and adult audiences, the writing lacked a distinct voice and sense of maturity. And for me, the quality of an author's writing can either enhance the story and fold me further into its spell, or disengage me from the experience. I think you can guess where this book fell on that spectrum.<br /><br />Ultimately, THE QUEEN OF BLOOD frustrated me as much as it fascinated me. And that's a shame, considering the stunning and unique worldbuilding. Maybe if the sequel improves on this first book, I'll continue the series.<br /><br />Maybe...", "images": [], "asin": "006247409X", "parent_asin": "006247409X", "user_id": "AGXOFDKGAESNV62XRQ2ISG76YGCQ", "timestamp": 1496173314000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 4}

{"rating": 1, "title": "Preaching to the Choir", "text": "I tried to be open and listen to this. I reached a point, I just couldn't go any further.  Maybe it was the style.  Maybe it was the vitriolic writing rather than impartiality?  Or perhaps it was the opinions stated as fact?  Maybe it is the glorification of the past without regard for what it has caused in the future?  For example:  While it is true that social security initially started as a social redistribution program paid for by the rich, it isn't a glorious program when it became compulsory to be paid for by everyone.  Dare I mention that it has now grown to be one of the largest unfunded mandates in the U.S.?  And Medicare?  Has it really pulled the common people out of poverty?  Between Social Security and Medicare they are the top two problems with the national debt.  So while they might have been good ideas at the time, over time they act as the biggest debt chains on everyone in the U.S.<br /><br />Or another example - the term 'Economic Equality' when used by a liberal.  Economic equality to a liberal means that those who work or have money support the lazy ones .  Why don't they just say socialism or communism and bring up Russia or China? Russia collapsed and China found that people wouldn't work if they couldn't be rewarded for their efforts.<br /><br />So while it may be true that conservatives Bush and Reagan did bad things, it is also true that the liberals have done some abominable things to take away the rights and economies of the common person.<br /><br />So while this may be a study in viewpoints that perhaps shows a different perspective to conservativism, this book isn't what I had hoped it would be.

In total, this book has more than 400 photos.<br /><br />- The photo are sharp and colorful.<br /><br />- It lists places of interest and famous citizens of each city.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />- I believe 4 photos can not adequately describe the beauty of a city. Eight photos will do. That means the book would be 480 pages thick not 240 as it is now. That was manageable but may be the publisher did not like the extra cost.<br /><br />- About 25 percent of the photos are smaller than 1/8th the size of the page. That makes it too difficult to clearly see the details.

By the time she gets to the small herd on pages 3-4, she is now wearing brown pants and somehow there's a sweater involved according to the text.  Prince has a blue streak flashing out of his open mouth, which is supposed to be his tugging on a sweater, although his mouth is open and the \"sweater\" seems to be coming from UNDER Anna's short-sleeve shirt--and an open mouth equals no tugging.  The rest of the story has no illustrator-author incongruities.<br /><br />We do learn from the story how a horse has to develop trust in a handler, a handler needs patience with a horse, and how some horses are easily spooked by unfamiliar sights and sounds.

{"rating": 3, "title": "... this book to read this week - and I love cookbooks! I have quite a few of them", "text": "I got this book to read this week - and I love cookbooks! I have quite a few of them, and always prefer books with clear photos of the dishes described. It helps me when I am choosing a recipe to prepare. If I can't see the picture, and I am not familiar with the dish, I have to carefully read the recipe, and try to imagine, which I don't always have time to do. Also, when we are talking cookbooks, we judge them by the pictures. We cannot smell the food, we cannot taste it yet, so we have to use our vision sense to help us imagine, and smell the dish if you will. If something is not photographed right, you can usually still have a feel of what it would be, but if there is no picture at all - it is just hard to imagine what the book is telling you to do. No pictures next to recipes is a major downfall of this book.<br /><br />Now, there are some pictures as dividers of chapters but they are not named, and it is hard to see what recipe they actually represent. This book looks more like an old-fashioned cookbook without those key pictures. Even bloggers like myself with no budget, and passable photography skills can take pictures to show. I understand the author has no budget for photography but should have made a better effort - I could take pictures for free just to be mentioned in the book! I am sure a lot of other starting out photographers would do it - and it is not hard, you are going to cook those dishes anyways, why not take pictures?<br /><br />Here is what I like about the book - it gives a recipe of homemade garam masala, even several versions of it. This mix is essential for Indian cooking, and it helps to see this book's version as it is such a great spice to have - I use it a lot, I buy mine pre-mixed, but when I get to a point of having more time for cooking I will definitely consult this book for advice!<br /><br />One recipe that I also find to be more of a filler is the recipe of plain basmati rice. This is a specialized cookbook. I can find how to cook rice on the package of rice, or look it up. I don't really need to be taught how to make rice in a specialized book - this is an easy recipe, and too basic to list in my opinion, or it shouldn't take the whole page, but be a part of a recipe that uses rice like pilaf. I don't know, that's my opinion.<br /><br />Other than these comments, I think the recipes in the book are very regional, sound delicious, and it is great to be able to learn and share the knowledge of the chef by trying these out - sounds like a lot of family and regional secrets revealed in this book, so my trips to my favorite Indian restaurants are going to be less now since I can simply cook all of those dishes myself - and I trust they will turn out! A lot of new to me dishes that I will love to try like carrot halva, spiced fried eggplant, and makhanwala - an intriguing name!<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "images": [], "asin": "1623156963", "parent_asin": "1623156963", "user_id": "AHQOOECTZG2C5QSFGXET2VTVXKEQ", "timestamp": 1462223824000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 2}

The ambling preamble promised NEW insights into the 'flak war', but none were forthcoming.<br /><br />MINUS ONE STAR: Failure to analyze or even mention some of the most decisive AA battles of the war, such as the successful Allied air defense of the Remagen Bridgehead or the pivotal role played by Admiral Lee's battle line during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.<br /><br />MINUS ONE STAR: Questionable data. Too many times this author cites 'facts' that are in complete disagreement with those cited by reputable sources. Example 1: the effectiveness of the US Navy's 5/38 vs 20mm and 40mm mounts. The author cites an extremely low effective rate (based on pre VT-fused data sets?) that i cannot find corroborated by any other source. The Author's number is in fact 37% lower than any other source's mid 44 -- 1945 data. This book, more than any other, should at the very least explain the difference. Example 2: The author claims the first use of fully automated gun laying (US 90mm AA guns coupled with the M9 gun director coupled with the SR584) occurred during the defense of Antwerp (Nov 44). Other sources cite Henderson Field (1943) or Anzio (early 44). Why the discrepency?<br /><br />MINUS ONE STAR: Unsubstantiated Claims. One example: Author claims war time experience shows that low to mid level air attack against an alerted AA defense was doomed to fail. Really? Perhaps he should imagine himself in the shoes of a Japanese AA gunner in 1943 New Guinea attempting to defend his airfield against a treetop B25 strafing/parafrag attack.", "images": [], "asin": "0811719928", "parent_asin": "0811719928", "user_id": "AFBSM2PBPE36NL2PPVR5ULQHRTZA", "timestamp": 1554814433690, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 1}

This one, however, was almost torture.<br /><br />  The story is ludicrous. A Vietnam-era rogue CIA agent who supposedly stole millions commits robberies with multiple-murders for a few thousand dollars. Then the, supposedly super-secretive, big-time secret agent allegedly worth millions moves from his San Francisco home to the same part of the desert where he committed some of these penny-ante robberies and allows pictures of the interior of his new house to be published in an architectural magazine - pictures that show some of the stolen loot.<br /><br />  Nonsensical. Ludicrous. Just plain silly.

Tommy Vang alternates between playing one of the dumbest characters to grace the pages of a bad novel to one of the most astute.

While main plot won't rock your socks off with originality and complexity, I believe that this book actually never meant to do it in the first place.

He touches briefly on all aspects of Gretzky\u2019s career and gives you just enough insight to wet your appetite before moving on to his next topic.  Unfortunately, the book as a whole was like eating cotton candy:  sweet and tasty but not filling.<br /><br />Strachan, who is a hockey journalist and a good friend of Gretzky, certainly provided some glimpses under the curtain (or under the ice if you will), but for the most part it is just a regurgitation of Wayne\u2019s many achievements and almost reads like a lifetime achievement award video.  The information skips around, touches on elements and then moves on with little additional analysis or  substantive counter points of view.<br /><br />After Gretzky\u2019s short time in St. Louis (that debacle was an interesting), Strachan chooses to focus more on Wayne\u2019s involvement with the World Cup and Olympics (interesting and deserving of discussion) ignoring his time in New York. \u00a0As a Ranger fan I was looking forward to some glimpses into this tenure of his career. \u00a0The book\u2019s only Ranger focus was on his last game and when he decided to retire.<br /><br />Strachan\u2019s close relationship with Gretzky also made the read slightly tedious with his constant praise and biased view. \u00a0I am surprised the title of the book wasn\u2019t \u201cGretzky: \u00a0A March Towards Sainthood\u201d. \u00a0Granted, the man was a great player, ambassador, and is seemingly a genuinely decent guy off the ice, but there were too many times when Strachan would blame the failures of other people if Gretzky didn\u2019t achieve \u201cgreatness\u201d, or ignore many of the contributions of other people in helping Gretzky when he did achieve \u201cgreatness\u201d.  I could practically hear Jan from the Brady bunch just screaming \u201cGretzky, Gretzky, Gretzky\u201d instead of Marsha\u2019s name.<br /><br />I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it but I did enjoy reading about Gretzky\u2019s contribution to hockey, his many individual accomplishments, and his passion to help spread the love of the game. \u00a0However, I would have liked a more objective view with more insight from other players, coaches, and NHL personnel to give a more rounded perspective of certain times during his career.", "images": [], "asin": "0771083386", "parent_asin": "0771083386", "user_id": "AEM4JQ2VJH5HOB7YA4U5CFYEHXUA", "timestamp": 1423191689000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 3}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Yawn...", "text": "Sick Little Monkeys details the career of Ren & Stimpy\u2019s eccentric and rebellious creator John Kricfalusi, who has been described by many as either an animation genius or a creative control freak. Mr. K always insisted on doing things his way whether his bosses agreed with him or not. The byproduct of his madness was cartoons that embraced toilet humor, bodily horror, and an uncaring attitude towards the youths they were marketed to. John K made many enemies during his time creating cartoons, but it begs the question of whether or not it was all worth it given the cult following Ren & Stimpy had and still has today.<br /><br />I swore I would finish this book all the way through, but the repetitive and dull writing style makes it impossible to do so. Many of the same talking points were shoved down my throat over and over again whether it was John K\u2019s rebelliousness, his inability to meet deadlines, his cartoons\u2019 disgustingness, and worst of all, how \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d competing cartoons were. About the last item on that list, it would appear as if the author was taking sides with John K, but there were also times when he criticized the animator with as much venom as he did the competitors. If this book has a message, it was lost a long time ago the minute the writing style bored me to tears.<br /><br />Perhaps the writing style could have been improved with some showing instead of telling. Instead of telling me how \u201cbad\u201d other cartoons are, show me what specifically made them that way. But of course, the author couldn\u2019t do that without alienating the laymen of the animation world. Insider terms are used a lot in this book, which would have been fine if the book was marketed to professional animators as opposed to merely fans of Ren & Stimpy. I went into this read wanting to learn about the cartoon that made my childhood a happy time of my life. Instead all I got was technical drivel combined with a desert-dry writing style.<br /><br />The closest the author ever got to showing instead of telling was pictures scattered here and there of John K\u2019s sketches and storyboards. While pictures are always more effective at communicating than words, if that was all I wanted, I would have watched a movie. I wanted to read a book and use my imagination, an imagination guided by an author who\u2019s supposed to be as entertaining as he is informative. I would have even settled for a graphic novel if that\u2019s what the author really wanted. At least with a graphic novel, it wouldn\u2019t feel like my eyes were being dragged across sandpaper. Now there\u2019s a visual worthy of a Ren & Stimpy episode!<br /><br />This was not a fun book to read and I can\u2019t recommend it to my friends. I tried. I really tried. I wanted to like it and become a more educated person because of the reading experience. But no matter what, it just wouldn\u2019t happen. I\u2019d already known John K was a little off-color and this book does a good job of illustrating his depravity, but ultimately it\u2019s not enough to keep my interest.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Boring", "text": "This is easily the most boring book I ever attempted to read. I wasted one evening trying to like it. I even committed the cardinal sin of book reading by skipping ahead to see if it improved over time. No such luck. It was consigned to \"the thrift store basket\" the next morning (today as a matter of fact). I was very disappointed as I had read \"The Omnivores Dilemma\" by the same author and found it wonderfully interesting and thought provoking and was looking for more of the same.<br /><br />This book is not about gardening. It is about the authors philosophy regarding gardening and how that developed along with his garden. This book is extremely cerebral. Too highbrow for my tastes. I was hoping for an amusing anecdotal tale of how a beginning gardener battled the forces of evil (pests,weeds and soil) in New England ground that had never seen a real garden before.<br /><br />Instead, for example, I was treated to pages upon pages of philosophical discussion of the place of Lawn in Americas cultural and societal structure and how how our Lawn differs from that of the English in terms of fenced and walled vs not fenced and not walled and the reason for Americas break from the English method-revolt. Not to mention the place, or lack thereof, of Lawn in the garden schema.<br /><br />We are similarly treated to more pages regarding the philosophy of eliminating pests in the garden be they flora or fauna. Not to mention the sexual enticement of the Rose-but not any rose-only a old world rose will do-not a ridiculous modern hybrid tea rose. Really?<br /><br />However other reviews indicate that other people like it. And, according to the book cover, it is listed as being among some horticultural society's 75 most important gardening books of all time. So what do I know.<br /><br />I do know one thing. That buying books on line because they \"sound good\" cannot take the place of actually looking at them in a real bookstore. I had learned the hard way that one only buys cookbooks at a real book store.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A Political Thriller without the Thrill", "text": "President Charlotte Kramer has just won reelection for a second term after breaking from tradition and choosing a member of the opposition party as her vice presidential running mate instead of the incumbent from her first term. Now only weeks into her term, she and others are noticing some problems with Tara Meyers, the new vice president. She's not as focused on the policies and issues as she needs to be, is canceling appearances, and working from home frequently. Staffers are starting to ask questions, and members of the press are digging for answers.<br /><br />The premise of this near-future political thriller was an interesting one, tracing the ripple effects of a possibly impaired elected member of the federal government and how that could spawn investigations, grand juries, and special councils that impact not only the politician in question but the administration itself. Unfortunately the execution of the idea was not handled in such a way that did it justice.<br /><br />Much of the punch of the story is removed in the first few pages of the book when Tara Meyers's household goods are being packed and moved from the vice president's official residence. So the reader already knows the outcome, just not whether her removal from the office was voluntary or forced. After that, most of the book becomes a look back at how things got to that point and removes the suspense from the story.<br /><br />The focus of much of the book is centered around the vice president's senior adviser, Dale Smith. Again since the final outcome is already known by the reader, Dale's observations and concerns seem less of a shock, as do those of all the other White House characters and members of the press and Congress.<br /><br />Another failing of the book was the big build up of the congressional battles being faced by the president on account of her vice presidential choice, yet the reader is not given the payoff of her testimony to stave off impeachment proceedings or that of others' testimony in grand jury hearings. As a result, the story ends in more of a fizzle than the big bang that the situation would inspire. The inside, dramatic details are omitted leaving the reader with an unsatisfying experience. The outcome was revealed from the beginning, so there is not even a mystery left to fall back on.<br /><br />Not recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "1451610963", "parent_asin": "1451610963", "user_id": "AHKVCPZTICIDUMFGKSTZAVCBCBWQ", "timestamp": 1471981086000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 2}

{"rating": 3, "title": "The statistics and facts stated in this book should not be overlooked.", "text": "I would probably give this book 3.5 stars if I could. It's definitely somewhere in between 3 and 4 stars.<br /><br />I picked up this book because I happed to agree with the author. As anyone in Corporate America knows these days, leading or managing people isn't what it used to be - even 10 years ago. Things have changed - and continue to change drastically - as global economy takes over more and more everyday. Personally, I am on the fence about this global economy. On one hand, I think it's good that goods & services can be traded around the world - it invites more competition and provide people with goods & services that they might not have otherwise. On the other hand, it doesn't do much for job growth, particularily in the U.S. where trade laws remain unprotected, if looking at it from a labor workers' point of view. But that's what great about this book - it literally loads you with facts about countries, the population of the world overall, different types of economies (Capitalism, Communism, Socialism), and provides you with the good & bad of each, allowing you to make up your own mind about if the end of power is a step forward or a step backward.<br /><br />Some of the reviews state that this reads like a textbook - and it does. However, the facts that were researched in this book cannot be dismissed, as the author has obviously completed some SERIOUS fact-checking & researching. And, the fact that a lot of what he says in the book (written in 2006), has actually come to fruition in 2015. I think as most people read this book they will agree with the facts that the author points out, especially if your a leader or someone in management.<br /><br />I will disagree with a quote on the back cover that states that the book &#34;will change my views on how I see and read the news&#34;. This is not a true fact. As one should realize by now, most of the news station broadcasts are done so by corporations that own them, so people should know that the news is already biased, so I'm not quite sure why one would think that from reading this book.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good read with some fascinating statistics in it. It's definitely a slower read, as it does read like a textbook at times. Although the book is a small paperback.

The concerning issue is the author\u2019s response to the 150 or so critics that he cites, and dismisses, in the book, primarily, with the rationale that most, supposedly colleagues, whom he believes are more interested in history, are seemingly indifferent to the \u201cfuture\u201d, at least the far future where computers are able to emulate humans, as suggested by the title, The Age of EM.<br /><br />Hanson wants to legitimize his analysis or predictions by his adoption of a heavily footnoted, academic style, while simultaneously dismissing others who have adopted a narrative often cast in the genre of science fiction.  What he fails to understand, and denies leveraging, is that much of the analysis of artifacts and scientific research are also woven into \u201cstories\u201d. In fact, Yuval Harari\u2019s \u201cSapiens\u201d makes the strong case that what is responsible for human progress is language and the ability to tell \u201cstories\u201d.<br /><br />Hanson has a strong history of research and development in the hard sciences and information technology and if he had focused that knowledge to take the global research and carefully develop a scenario to show the pathway to machines that can emulate human brains one would have an understanding of the current and needed directions to a promised realization. But, one suspects that such a book would have limited readership, and only within a select community. This is clear where the author makes the distinction between machine emulations and what he sees as a weaker research arena, artificial intelligence which, today, is in ascendance and which has captured the imagination across academic disciplines and the commercial sector, globally.<br /><br />The author\u2019s intellectual path took an orthogonal turn into the social sciences, particularly, economics. Herein lies the fatal flaw in the book\u2019s thesis. Unlike fiction, particularly science fiction, the book does not have a cohesive story, with the exception that the volume is written from and within a western cultural paradigm with seemingly a conventional neoclassical economic perspective. The book creates a very sketchy evolutionary model from foraging to farming to industrialization. And there it stops. It is a standard western rendering. While there are copious references, they are selective and many of these taken within their academic frame are, themselves, not necessarily without their own controversies and accepted interpretations.<br /><br />More importantly, in an age of \u201cEM\u201d with the wired equivalent of Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s Noosphere, it is questionable whether that cultural mold can hold.  In fact, in an academic environment characterized by ever narrowing disciplinary focus, scholars may less readily accept the selective citations as rationales.<br /><br />Hanson eschews the idea of fictional stories, yet he uses this model to selectively pick potential traits of his EM\u2019s in some distant future, one that looks much like North America or Europe with its current culture and economy. It is as if all the work in creating EM\u2019s will yield a 1:1 socioeconomic and personality matching of the current middle class and that world is the future. Hanson seems to believe that by playing the academic and selectively, but extensively, documenting his narrative that it avoids the idea that his \u201cstory\u201d takes credence over the metaphorical world relegated to science fiction, at least in validating his concept of what EM\u2019s will be and how they will function in the evolution beyond our current industrial models.<br /><br />The fatal flaw is trying to treat a complex bio/physical/socio/economic system with a rational/scientific model. Hold constant all variables except the one under investigation. In this case, humans create EM\u2019s and then they are written into fringe obscurity devoid of any advancement since EM\u2019s fulfill those niches in both the mundane and the creative, except for leisure. Somehow that which drives humans to create EM\u2019s and the world up to the manifestation of EM\u2019s is exorcized. Somehow the current economic models now under evolutionary pressure by what has been defined as heterodox thinking, and tied to the growing environmental concerns with global warming and many other issues, remain frozen until EM\u2019s with their superior processing and advanced physical capabilities reach consciousness.<br /><br />While Hanson tries to inject some emotion into the EM\u2019s, since they are emulations of the human brain, his one-dimensional focus on pleasure with sexual relations, artificially induced in electromechanical systems, fails. He, like many of those he criticizes, fails to release the single vision constraints by assuming that all EM\u2019s, except for \u201cwork\u201d have the same socio/cultural homogeneity. Issues such as minority rights, religious differences and global cultural tensions across individual and geo/political boundaries disappear, probably because humans have become socio/political eunuchs or perhaps, as in the movie, The Matrix, all are fed the \u201cblue pill\u201d in their diets and live in a dream world.<br /><br />Rudy Rucker is another scientist who has crossed the academic boundaries but, unlike Hanson, has, also, written in the science fiction genre. His substantive work, The Ware Tetrology, carries EM\u2019s into the time when they inhabit biological forms resembling humans and who eventually seek citizenship along side of humans. Rucker, Stephenson in his \u201cDiamond Age\u201d, David Brin in the Hanson cited \u201cKiln People\u201d and a number of science fiction writers have taken, as has Hanson, that EM\u2019s will be constructed.  But they have removed the social constraints.<br /><br />In many ways Hanson has adopted the same conservative idea of the distant future of his critics, by constraining his \u201cstory\u201d to that which can be footnoted or which can be molded within the current collegial fabrications.  This review is being written in 2016 during the current presidential race in the United States. One understands the potential global ramifications at a time when the Middle East is in the midst of violent culture and political discord.<br /><br />Similarly, the issues resulting from the 2008 financial meltdown have not been resolved and the international finance communities are also in a quandary. One can readily understand why it may not be thinking about the future that is the problem, but rather it\u2019s the cognitive dissonance in the attempt to academically rationalize this analysis into its reductionist format.", "images": [], "asin": "0198754620", "parent_asin": "0198754620", "user_id": "AHUARC4SOYQZXL4G4OEPNO62VWNA", "timestamp": 1478534745000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

As this book had captured my attention from the cover and also the fact it had said it would be a \"romantic suspense\". However, going into it - I clashed with the main female lead as I found her one of those spoiled housewives who eventually realize that she doesn't like the way she has turned out and so she packs and leaves and starts again. Our main character didn't come from money and was at a point a hard worker and then she married a rich and wealthy husband, course the next part is very cliched - she fell into the role as a rich man's wife and then one day, experienced a tragedy that caused her to wake up from her stupor and discover her whole life was a sham and then she leaves her husband and settles into a small-town where she secretly had brought a fixer-upper cottage for herself. We also learn that due to Grey's life with her husband, the bottle aka alcohol became her best friend and soon she will find herself always needing that next fix, and soon the drinking will cause her to lose everything including a job she did at one time love, but as she won't stoop to the level of the others and sleep with the boss - that was at a standstill too. Of course, while she is in town - Grey will discover a couple of potential love interests in either Lucas - the developer, and Declan- the neighbour.

Rickie's life develops in ways he initially believes he wants, but that ultimately end up denying him his dreams and diminishing him as a person.<br /><br />Although set in stereotypical English locations of university and boarding school, it is clear that the narrative uses these locations to show their hollow underpinnings. Much of the narrative hinges on the personal disasters and tragedies that expectations, mores, and conventions bring to individuals who fall outside the realm of what is considered acceptable. The book as a whole is much more a send-up of English society than a conventional novel that plays out within its boundaries.<br /><br />For me, none of the characters really connected. They were all ultimately rather unlikable, with some more overtly evil than others. The stylistic choices are also unusual, and the language is generally more associative and based on thoughts and feelings than clearly or linearly structured. At times it is difficult to get a clear sense of each character within the scenes, or an understanding of the sequence of events. I found it an interesting experience to read this kind of language, but was left with the memory of jumbled, bright images, not really a clear recollection. I understand that this was the author's favorite novel he had written, and that there was much in here that was personal and important to him.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Constable Needs to be Better at Detective Work", "text": "I liked the debut Bess Ellyott Mystery enough that I read the second in the series.  However, this one is not par with the first with regards to detective work.  For those of you who did not read the first one\u2014\u2014-Bess Ellyott is a widow escaping some shadowy intrigue in London after her husband is murdered.  While ensconced in her brother\u2019s house, she somehow entangles herself in two mysteries.  As a herbalist/healer, she can gain entrance to other people\u2019s houses without suspicion.  There is a constable in the village named Kit Harwoode.  The constable job was thrust upon him by his cousin Gibb.  He\u2019s really a landowner/farmer.<br /><br />A traveling troupe of players (think Elizabethan time) is in Wiltshire entertaining the town.  A player is found murdered on a hill that the townspeople fear, and a young woman is found in Bess\u2019 backyard bloodied.  The whole village is up in arms about witchcraft.  The characters are likable enough.  Unlike the first in series, this story is not saturated with terminology I had to stop every five minutes to look in the dictionary.  I found the detecting by Constable Hardwoode lacking.  An epiphany discovered by the two really could have been gained earlier if the constable had been more inquisitive in his questioning of the suspects.  Granted he is a landowner not trained in this work.  There were so many characters involved in this web that I was thankful there were summary conversations to catch me up.  It was a light read for me.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Unsatisfying and Ultimately Boring", "text": "I bought this book because I  expected to enjoy it, but although I read the whole thing, only one chapter, on the Irish Famine, actually held my interest. The problem with the other chapters is that they are so diffuse that they end up seeming to say almost nothing. The weather, it is a'changin, is the theme, and it is supported by paragraph after paragraph of sweeping generalizations. Yes, there are small anecdotes scattered throughout to enliven the weather-reporting, but in the end, they all blur together.<br /><br />Picture reading a summary of the weather in the United States over the past 10 years, and you will have a very good idea of how this book reads: Some regions experienced extreme cold and snow during the winter, while other areas in the west were dry and sunny.l The springs were warmer than average, rainfall was heavy, and there were hurricanes and tornadoes in the south.  Now stretch that out for page after page and see if your head does not begin to nod.<br /><br />The thesis of the book is that, well, we can't engage in environmental determinism, because that is an academic taboo, but we can say that the climate has changed and that history has happened, and that there seems that there might be a connection. Not very compelling, is it? *Of course* changes in climate *cause* changes in human behavior and thus in history! If the area where you can or cannot grow food changes, then that will perforce change where people live and how they live, and that's history! Was the French revolution caused by the extreme poverty of French peasants, and by the fact that their overlords seemed to have no interest in how they produced the food they all needed? Who can doubt it? And does climate affect the ability to grow food? Obviously!<br /><br />The one chapter that really hung together was An Ghorta Mor, about the Great Hunger in Ireland caused by the failure of the potato crop. For the first time in the whole book, the author slows down and focuses on a single region and a single period of time, rather than sweeping from decade to decade and place to place. And that works. But mostly you read things like, &#34;Weather in northern Europe was extremely cold. The rivers in xyz froze over. New Zealand, meanwhile, was also cold, and there was famine in China.&#34; Just too broad to be of any interest to read.<br /><br />Some people complain about the fact that the author tacks on comments about our current Global Warming controversy (if controversy it is) and appends a chapter at the end making a somewhat half-hearted argument that yes, global warming is real, it is man-made, and it might be bad. I really don't care by the time I get to that chapter, because he has already demonstrated to my satisfaction that the climate has changed many times and we don't really know why. If a Little Ice Age brings suffering, might a warm age actually ameliorate human life in some way? Maybe. Might it spur new technologies? Probably. This is hardly a screed telling me to give up my car and ride a bike to work. All the evidence herein suggests that mainly, we don't know, the patterns are irregular and hard to interpret, and that extreme cold is no picnic for human civilizations.<br /><br />One other point that deserves mention is the choice to use metric measurements throughout the book. Ok, I get it, as Americans, we are the only ones who aren't very familiar with those measurements. But the intro gives false information about the relationship between kilometers and miles. And then throughout the rest of the book, I would have to mentally translate every fact: winters were 2 degrees C. colder, and the glaciers advanced 2.5 kilometers down into the valleys. Often, instead of absolute numbers, we are given comparisons, but all this just makes it hard for me to form a mental image of what it was like. New York was 2 degrees C colder than 10 years before, and there were 28 days of below-zero weather. (Is that below zero C? If so, isn't that pretty much what winter is?)<br /><br />I really expected to be interested in the daily life of Europeans from 1300-1850 and how weather impacted them, but in the end, I didn't feel that I got that. Maybe it's because the facts are just so diffuse--no trend is obvious enough close-up to make much of a picture. But I think the author made many bad choices, giving us too many broad statements and not enough picturable narratives.", "images": [], "asin": "0465022723", "parent_asin": "0465022723", "user_id": "AH7P7GYUT5IVPA5LDIFQ75MAKEUA", "timestamp": 1452355785000, "helpful_vote": 50, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

{"rating": 3, "title": "strong three, more than satisfying conclusion to series", "text": "Hour of Need is the concluding book in Michael Pryor's Laws of Magic's series and it brings a good series to a fitting and satisfying close. I won't bother recapping the general premise as you'll want to have read the prior (or should that be Pryor) books first so you can check out the setting etc. in my earlier reviews. Suffice to say it's set in an alternate Edwardian time period that has been moving toward and then finally arriving at their version of World War I involving both technology and magic.<br /><br />All the major characters return for Hour of Need: Aubrey--whom I've described as a mix of Holmes, Tow Swift, and Hermione Granger; his best friend George--reliably strong and warm-hearted; Caroline--his crack shot, martial artist maybe-finally-girlfriend-this-book; and Sophie, coming into her own magically in this book as well as moving more seriously into her relationship with George. As one might expect in the conclusion, the villain--Dr. Tremaine--is here as well, and yes, he and Aubrey do have a final confrontation.<br /><br />The book is darker that the earlier ones in the sense that while the first few were heading into the war and the last one has the group fighting at the fringes, here we see the actual front and it has all the horror as the non-alternate-universe WWI--the trenches, wire fencing, shell-shocked soldiers, are all here and it makes for a nice raising of the stakes as well as some strong, affecting imagery.<br /><br />The grim nature and darker imagery in the middle section strengthen the book, as does the continued development of the relationship among the characters and the movement toward an awareness of the horror of war no matter which side (that isn't to say Pryor offers up any moral relativism here; he simply doesn't shy away from the sometimes monstrous things being done).<br /><br />Hour of Need `s flaws will be familiar to readers of the series--though they are presented as difficult, it still feels that things come a bit too easily or quickly to Aubrey and that's true as well for Sophia, whose magic skills are moving perhaps a bit too fast. Though Pryor still does an excellent job in the presentation of the magic itself as a kind of science in its intellectual rigor. Tremaine remains a bit too abstract, the confrontation is a bit perfunctory, and this book, like others, could have lost 50-75 pages or so.<br /><br />But overall, as mentioned, it's a fitting and satisfactory conclusion. I've called the series \"charmingly old-fashioned\" and it remains so to the end. Too old-fashioned for some I've no doubt, but personally I found it to be one of the series' greatest strengths and, to be fully honest, a bit of a relief amidst all the \"gritty\" or dystopic YA fiction.

This book describes various cults the world over, and attempts to explain the power these leaders have over their flocks.<br /><br />What a huge pile of disappointment this book was.  It had the potential to be really interesting, but sadly it was not.  The book is divided into three sections, and the first section just seems laughable.  First off, for a book of \"case studies\" there is absolutely NO citation of the information written.  The first part reads more like what most people think or suspect, as opposed to documented statements of fact.  I get the idea that informants may need to remain anonymous, but with no other citation, the stories just seem far fetched.<br /><br />In the other two sections, on almost every page, a lengthy direct quote of someone else's research is listed, yet there is no bibliography at the end of the book.

I am not an editor, but these were glaring mistakes, and so many, I suspect the book was not edited.<br /><br />The subject matter of the book was great, and the last 2 sections touched on quite a few cults I had never heard of, so I did learn some things from the book.

Jordan and Chase are young guys who\u2019ve stolen sleeping pills and are travelling. Lila is a teenager whose folks have sent her on the road to protect her from their insomniac rage. Biggs is searching for his insomniac wife. So basically, all these folks have found themselves in a symbolic dark wood and angry raging sleepless folks are blocking them from the path direct.<br /><br />I really didn't feel the sleeplessness vibe. I just didn't. The author seemed to be exploring the frustrated, malicious, existential resentment of he \u201chave-nots\u201d towards the &#34;haves.&#34; Those who cannot sleep are pretty vicious towards those who can.<br /><br />As is to be expected when everyone in the nation goes sleepless, the entire infrastructure falls apart. Universal insomnia being the cause of anarchy, I can believe. But I'm not sure the sleepless would have energy to be so nasty. As for the cause of the sleeplessness, the author riffs on the probable spiritual, emotional, or societal cause of this ongoing catastrophe.  But in the end, I'm not sure what \u201csleeplessness\u201d is a metaphor for.  Are the ones who are able to sleep the true victims? Or are they the strong ones because they can shut off life and fall into peacefulness when they want to?<br /><br />The story feels like a series of poetic meditations thematically held together by the male characters\u2019 goals, especially their goals toward their wives. If you intend to read this book, put away all thoughts about \u201cbeginning, middle, and end.\u201d There is no real \u201cending\u201d here.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Too much history, not enough storytelling", "text": "This review has some spoilers. I've tried to mark them for those who haven't read the book.<br /><br />O editor, editor! Wherefore art thou editor?<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've been this disappointed in a book. I wanted to love this book. I truly did. The All Souls Trilogy has so much potential, but, alas, readers are given a history lesson with a little storytelling thrown in. (And I use the term \"storytelling\" lightly).<br /><br />Let me just start with the things I enjoyed about the book, however few they may be.<br /><br />- I still like the idea of the plot. A powerful witch who doesn't know her own strength, a hidden manuscript that contains all manner of secrets about the creation of witches, vampires and daemons, and a bunch of crazies running around trying to prevent change and forbidden love.<br />- The rich history that Harkness portrays in her stories. She is a historian through and through, and it shows in her writing. If she would just tone it down a bit, I think it would appeal to a wider audience. She does a fantastic job of depicting the culture and architecture of Elizabethan England, and creates an outstanding visual for the reader.<br />- The last thing I liked about this book is the appearance of the fathers: Phillipe and Stephen Proctor. They were the only characters with any common sense, and were actually likable. Phillipe was the only thing that made the first part of the book bearable.<br /><br />And that's about it for the goods. I will try to keep the bad list as short as possible.<br /><br />- As I said, Harkness has the ability to portray a time and place of the past that only a true historian could do, but apparently it's assumed that readers have no imagination and must have EVERYTHING spelled out for us. There is way too much detailing that could have been edited out, and that is my major issue with this book. It's devoted, entirely, to miniscule details that in no way relate to the true plot of the story. The first half of the book consists of introducing you to the new surroundings and characters that put a damper on the story. There is no flow to it, and it drags on until well over halfway through the book.<br />- Character development is sketch in this second installment. There are so many contradictions to these characters, that by the end of this book I was done with all of them. Diana, who is supposed to be a student of alchemy, is still scared to death of her powers. Sigh. I'm sorry, but anyone who studies alchemy for a living would jump at the chance to have magic. She (supposedly) is an independent individual, but yet she relies on everyone else to do things for her and still has no desire to use her powers. Matthew is just a conundrum. He is controlling and possessive, yet somehow lets Diana romp all over England getting herself into trouble. (SPOILER) Not to mention that his best friend, Christopher Marlowe, is in love with him and therefore hates Diana, which leads to him spreading gossip, betraying Matthew, and ultimately trying to kill her. But get this! At the end of the story, Diana thinks it's best for them all to kiss and make up. Please. Where is crazy Matthew when you need him? That whole triangle of a relationship is too messed up for words. And I'm still not sure why Matthew didn't just kill him...<br />- The name dropping in this book is out of control. I'm still not sure how Shakespeare gave anything extra to this story. He is mentioned repeatedly yet we have no insight into his character. There are writers, alchemists, and royals thrown into the story at random, and it's just too much.<br />- (SPOILER) Lastly, and this is a completely personal opinion, I have some issues with one of the deeper subjects discussed in this book, which is Diana's miscarriage. After this happens, Matthew takes off with Marlowe every night getting drunk and high, but apparently this is okay, and Diana understands that he needs to act this way?? Umm... No, I'm pretty sure it is not okay. After this happened, I lost complete respect for Diana's character. No woman with any self-respect would make excuses for this type of behavior. Unfortunately, this is a normal way, for some people, to deal with grief, but it is not healthy and should not be brushed over with insignificance. It matters. This is not a light subject to throw into your story to create complications. Women deal with this issue all the time, and they should be empowered to stand up for their self and expect their partner to help them through the healing process. This act alone put into question exactly how genuine Matthew and Diana's relationship was. For me, everything else went downhill from there.<br /><br />Sadly, I don't think I even care at this point about reading the last book. I had issues with the first book but was hoping that the second would be a step up, and that just wasn't the case. If you are absolutely crazy about history and don't care about mindless prattle, then this may be the right fit for you, but don't expect a strong story line.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Good, but......", "text": "Original review, 2 November 2004<br /><br />Revised 25 January 2005<br /><br />Turns out my original review was referenced to the wrong edition, and with that I accept the objections which Raks and Nick raised.  The problem goes back to Amazon.com, who sent me the wrong book.<br /><br />That said, much of my original review still holds, though I am raising my evaluation from three to four stars.<br /><br />This book has much to recommend it--especially for beginners in a classroom situation.  However, it has too many errors and omissions to be fully satisfactory for unassisted use by the beginners it targets.<br /><br />This is a tutorial, not a reference work.  That is, going page by page from the beginning to the end, one gets reasonably complete coverage of the main features of Wildfire.  However, many features and operations are omitted from discussion or covered only superficially.  This would not be a problem in a classroom situation, or if there were an experienced Pro/E user close by to answer questions.  But a student working on his own will often be left floundering.  It helps if one has recourse to the Pro/E Help Center, though that is unnecessarily difficult to find answers from.<br /><br />Given the nature of Pro/E and the editorial style of the book, it is not practical to use an edition of the book which is not specific to the particular release of Pro/E.  Among other things, PTC Corp is in the process of converting the Menu Manager with its submenus to dialog boxes, so that a student may be misdirected unless matching editions are used.<br /><br />This edition appears to have fewer errors than the previous one.  Still, Mr. Tickoo needs to submit his manuscripts for editing, both of grammar/punctuation and of technical directions, by persons competent in English and in the programs.  The language errors are aggravating but do not diminish the technical value of the book.  The technical errors and omissions are more serious.  The instructions are often incomplete or incorrect to the extent that the indicated operations cannot be completed based on the information given.  For example, on page 4-14, Figure 4-24, the student is instructed to select the Edge.  That doesn't work.  The correct instruction is the corner--the \"Vertex.\"  The discussion of the Datum System, perhaps the most difficult and most critical aspect for a working knowledge of Wildfire, is skimpy at best.  The examples and instructions given in the text only equip the student to stumble around looking for workable solutions.<br /><br />The tutorials are for the most part explicit and complete, though sometimes excessively redundant on common features and short on instructions for new or uncommon features.  The Exercises, at the end of the chapters after the Tutorials and Review Questions, often rely on operations which are not discussed until a later chapter.<br /><br />Neverthless, all things considered, I would judge this book as a qualified success--excellent for classroom use or under the tutelage of an experienced user, OK for a resourceful independent beginner willing to poke around for solutions when things don't work as expected.<br /><br />It should be noted that Mr. Tickoo has provided extensive material on his website supplementing this book.  However, those materials work only for the Student/Tryout version of Wildfire, not for the commercial release.  A person using the commercial release should obtain a tryout version (free for two months) if he wants take advantage of Mr. Tickoo's supplementary materials.", "images": [], "asin": "1932709037", "parent_asin": "1932709037", "user_id": "AFQQYQ5ZME4Z35VCPJYIOM4CABYQ", "timestamp": 1099421480000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true, "label": 3}

Fiske, a professor of Psychology at Princeton.<br /><br />Humans, for their survival need to make quick, spontaneous judgments about others' intentions and how capable they are of carrying out those intentions.  Are they trust worthy honest and kind? Are they competent, capable and skilled?<br /><br />Successful companies need to exhibit both qualities.<br />Too much of one attribute without the other is ineffective or detrimental.<br /><br />The authors use grids with emotional responses as illustration. `Each combined pattern of warmth and competence perception leads to a predictable set of emotional responses.'<br />High warmth and low competence makes us feel pity.<br />High warmth and high competence make us feel pride.<br />Low warmth and low competence makes us feel disgust.<br />Low warmth and high competence make us feel envy.<br /><br />Think of a cold, yet competent surgeon with no bedside manner or a kind-hearted yet bumbling neighbor who bakes cookies.<br /><br />The authors highlight the brand Lululemon as using the winning formula by of what they call the Principal of Worthy Intentions, `a customer relationship strategy that involves attracting and keeping customers by consistently putting their best interests ahead of those of the company or brand.'<br /><br />This was written before the recent debacle with Lululemon's recall of Yoga pants that customers complained about being too sheer, (made too cheaply) and CEO Chip Wilson's inadvertently insulting apology, a cringe worthy example of how to destroy customer perception of worthy intentions. According to the ideas presented here, Lululemon has most recently exhibited low warmth and low competence.<br /><br />The book presents a simple eye-opening concept that makes sense and is backed up by research.<br /><br />There's another book entitled Compelling People by John Neffinger and Matthew Kohut which offers similar ideas to The Human Brand. That book says we judge by our unconscious perception of a person's strength and warmth.<br /><br />The Human Brand is worth reading, but in light of what we know to be Emotional Intelligence, this book doesn't really break new ground.

The only thing was that I figured out what was going to happen quite early - and hoped for the rest of the story that it would surprise me by going a different way. I was wrong. Oh well! It was also littered by some issues I have with Lackey's writing style, in particular the separation of words describing action. This isn't an example from the book - just an example. Lackey would say, &#34;I'm going to look the house over before I sign&#34; instead of &#34;I'm going to look over the house before I sign.&#34; It has more punch (and is grammatically correct) the second way.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The book of the super-werewolf", "text": "\"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf\" is one of those rare books that truly and completely defies classifiation.<br /><br />Rather than a straightforward fiction or genre story, Victor Pelevin's symbolism-crammed book hops from one style to another -- Eastern mysticism, Russian urban fantasy, inhuman love story, wildly funny satire and postmodern exploration of Russia's place in a post-Soviet world. Despite the wealth of symbolism and a heavy dose of Buddhist philosophy woven in,, it's not stuffy or boring -- instead it's a wickedly funny personal journey that slowly slips into a bittersweet pathos as our shapechanging heroine learns some truths of the universe.<br /><br />A Hua-li is a werefox -- an ancient, genderless creature with a hypnotic tail, a currently obscene name, who feeds off the energy emanated by humans during sex. She's also a virgin, and is starting to get an \"old maid complex.\"<br /><br />And to stay energized, she works as a prostitute in Russia -- she doesn't have actual sex with her clients, but manipulates them with her tail. But after some disastrous encounters, she finds herself being investigated by the Russian authorities -- and particularly by the handsome Alexander, a werewolf who transforms and molests A Hua-li. She's shocked but captivated by the young werewolf, and soon they're in the middle of a passionate affair. Yeah, great message to be sending.<br /><br />The subject of the super-werewolf prophecy comes up when A Hua-Li's older sister and her flaky English aristocrat hubby come for a visit, with said hubby intent on becoming the super-werewolf himself. And A Hua-Li sees the werewolves being used to call oil from a dry well. But when a shocking change comes over her werewolf paramour, A Hua-Li must reexamine their relationship as she keeps her lover safe -- and reveal what the prophecy of the super-werewolf truly means.<br /><br />Buddhism, wereanimals, aristocrat/chicken-hunting, mass media, Rainbow Streams, Nabokov, DVD sex games and hypnotic tails who contain all the truth of the universe. Victor Pelevin has a knack for bizarre postmodern fiction that is rarely seen outside a Haruki Murakami book\"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf\" is like a brightly coloured mosaic of randomly sized and shaped pieces.<br /><br />Along that ride, we're privy to A Hua-Li's intricate meditations on everything from sex to watermelons -- often described in carefully numbered lists. Pelevin fills his meandering storyline with literary allusions (hello, Nabokov!) and infuses it with plenty of wry humour (\"We foxes are keen hunters of English aristocrats and chickens\"). There's even a hilarious scene where Alexander and A Hua-Li contemplate what DVD movies they should play out as their sex games (\"Listen, how old are you, twelve?\" \"Okay, let's forget the Matrix\").<br /><br />Yet he has a knack for hauntingly memorable scenes as well. Any creature as ancient as A Hua-li will have a sense of bittersweetness in their life, and her view of her lover's shocking transformation and his subsequent fear and confusion are striking. And as the book winds toward its esoteric end, Pelevin unrolls a heavy swathe of Buddhist philosophy that finally explains who/what the super-werewolf is, and what the prophecy means. Let's just say that it's not your average \"chosen savior of Group X\" prophecy.<br /><br />And modern Russia, as Pelevin paints it, is all grimy cold urbanity speckled with American products and foreign businessmen. He injects a lot of symbolism (Alexander, the oil well, the super-werewolf, the hypnotic tails that can reveal the true nature of things) as well as a mocking satirical edge (a doomed aristocrat's nonsensical ramblings about how HE can become the super-werewolf without any enlightenment).<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like? A Hua-li being raped by Alexander and immediately falling for him.<br /><br />But A Hua-Li is a pretty oxymoronic character -- she can be ruthless, manipulative, loving and sweet, has the enthusiasm of the young nymphet she pretends to be yet is ancient and experienced beyond even her own measure. And Alexander is her total opposite -- rough, brash, traditional yet modern, and possessing a straightforward mind that struggles with the more unusual spiritual paths of the \"super-werewolf.\" And then there's A Hua-Li's sister -- merciless and wickedly funny, especially since she marries British aristos in order to \"hunt\" them.<br /><br />\"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf\" is a bizarre crazy-quilt of genres -- a sort of symbolic Buddhist urban-fantasy satire, with a mingling of bittersweet and hilarious.", "images": [], "asin": "B003VYBECU", "parent_asin": "B003VYBECU", "user_id": "AHVIMKECEZDXXK5QIGX7KWJPN6DQ", "timestamp": 1294000590000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label": 5}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Meh", "text": "My least favorite literary genre is fantasy.  I\u2019m just not a fan.  Every now and then I read one that I enjoy, and sometimes I read one that blows my mind.  However, most often I just don\u2019t love them.  I likely wouldn\u2019t have even had this one on my TBR list if it hadn\u2019t shown up on one of the book lists I follow.  This one was an add-on option for the Book of the Month Club\u2019s May 2022 box.  I didn\u2019t add it to the box, this isn\u2019t one I would want for my personal library, but I did add it to my TBR queue and grabbed it from my library (I love the library!  So many free books!).  I wasn\u2019t excited.<br /> This book has a setting I can identify, and the characters are actually people instead of some other entity with which I\u2019m unfamiliar.  Those two facts worked in its favor.  I dislike most fantasy because I don\u2019t want to have to visualize a completely different world and try to picture non-human entities.  I just want to dig into a story and lose myself.  While this book\u2019s format allowed me that privilege, I found myself struggling with the story.<br /> I became increasingly frustrated with back-and-forth timeline within Charlie\u2019s story.  I understand that Black needed to allow the reader to fully grasp Charlie and her background, I didn\u2019t like the way it played out.  It didn\u2019t seem to have a specific format, i.e.: one chapter now and one chapter then.  Black just sprinkled in Charlie\u2019s backstory whenever she felt like it.  I also felt like the story meandered.  There were minor storylines added in that seemed to have little purpose, despite being part of the bigger picture.  Then when the big picture was finally revealed, it felt very anticlimactic.<br /> And finally, I wanted more of Charlie\u2019s sister.  I can only assume that further volumes of this series will dive more deeply into her character, but until then I\u2019m just disappointed.

{"rating": 1, "title": "This third edition is truly a rip-off!", "text": "OK, what have we got here?  To cover six years worth of Star Wars continuity since the last edition of the Guide, we get around 100 pages of new materiel.  Except it isn't new.  The author made a point to include materiel fom The Phantom Menace and Vector Prime, but other than that it seems nothing released in the last 2-3 years made it in here! No material from Allston's X-wing books, no Union, no prequel-era stuff except for the movie itself.  While there is a bit about Kyle Katarn from the Dark Forces game, nothing about his role in the sequel, Jedi KNight, which came out about four years ago.  There are virtually no new pictures, most of them are merely lifted from the Essential Guides.<br />But perhaps the biggest problem is in the organization.  Gone are the categorical indeces of aliens, droids, ships, planets, creatures, etc... which were so helpful at the beginning of Edition 2, gone is even a rudimentary timeline, absent is the galactic map which has been gracing most of the more recent Star Wars fiction. Also gone is the neat seperation in the earlier edition between &quot;canon&quot; materiel -- that established in the movies and their novelizations -- and just about everything else.<br />For about twice the price of this book you can get the Star Wars Encyclopedia, which has more materiel, many, many more color photos and illustrations, and better organization of materiel.

The Fifth Heart is a ponderous elephant that doesn't even try to pick up the pea in the corner, but just talks endlessly about it. Simmons sophomoric attempt at metafiction (Holmes suspects -- wait for it -- he is a fictional character) is nothing more than a silly thought experiment, resolved by the intervention of a profoundly fictional character from another undistinguished Simmons novel (But not until James and Sam Clemens discuss whether they too are merely fictional characters: Deeep, dude!). His infatuation with Henry James seems to mainly center on whether the novelist was gay; his interest in Holmes centers around an [invented] taste for heroin. We are treated at one point to a two-page description of dinner (the food, not the event) in which Simmons flaunts his research by putting cigarettes on the menu only to be crossed out as vulgar. We are given not one but two tours of the Columbia Exposition. Likewise two anecdotes are both told twice, each of them half a page and barely necessary to the plot. The entire book rants about &#34;anarchists,&#34; which is a code word in SImmonsspeak [See Black Hills] for socialists and the labor movement. But it turns out that anarchists (the point is not explicit) are not responsible for the nefarious plot after all. In the last fifty pages, Simmons finally realizes that he has to deliver something after dragging us through a 550-page Baedeker, so something actually happens -- something totally void of credibility. I'm sorry, but even SImmons' misogynist recreation of Irene Adler would not do what she does. Just no.<br /><br />Simmons seems to feel that any historical personage he can wedge into his novels should be smirched in the process. This teenage nastiness made reading Drood a exercise in masochism and left me wanting a brain rinse after Black Hills. I don't care if John Hay and Henry Adams cheated on their wives. I don't care if Teddie Roosevelt was a buffoon (who knew??). I don't care if Henry James liked to look at naked men. I don't care if Sam Clemens missed the Columbia Exposition because he had a cold.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Did Not Meet Expectations", "text": "The Good Girl by Mary Kubica was one of those books that I have been looking forward to reading, believing that it\u2019ll be a great read especially from all the positive reviews I\u2019ve seen and heard. Unfortunately, the book didn\u2019t live up to the anticipation and expectation that I have been carrying around.<br /><br />While the book had a good concept and merit, the majority of my issues was mostly on the execution of the story. First, the writing was just average. I thought there were instances in which scenes and actions could\u2019ve been manipulated in such a way that it wouldn\u2019t have taken as long as it did to get to the point. As a result, the story had this slow pace that took the energy away from the story which in turn took away my energy in reading it. I wasn\u2019t exactly eager to get back to the book, even though I was close to finishing it. If the book isn\u2019t evoking a sense of excitement or eagerness in the reader, it would be difficult for said reader to reciprocate it in reading it.<br /><br />Second, I couldn\u2019t muster any kind of emotional attachment/reaction, positive or otherwise, to the characters. In a remote way, I know what I\u2019m supposed to be feeling but I just didn\u2019t feel it. I just felt the portrayal of the characters were stuck to the surface, never going any deeper or giving something new. Considering how the book was advertised, I was expecting something deeper and more complex than what I got.<br /><br />Finally, my biggest issue: the different viewpoints. I didn\u2019t have problems following the story through the switching of POV\u2019s. What my issue was the way Kubica used it. I thought the book could\u2019ve been better if she narrowed the number of POV\u2019s and assigning a particular character/POV with either the past or the present. If there wasn\u2019t a lot of switching of POV\u2019s and time flipping, it would\u2019ve made the story move at a faster pace and more efficient in its storytelling. As it was, it created a sort of discombobulated story flow to compound the issue of the story\u2019s pace.<br /><br />This book was one of those that I would include with the others who didn\u2019t meet my expectations. Perhaps that is my fault, I should know better than to have such thoughts going into a book. But I did and unfortunately, it fell a little short.
