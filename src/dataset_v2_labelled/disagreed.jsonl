{"rating": 4, "title": "My 3 years in Belgium is ending ... this book was a big help!", "text": "All in all, in my 3 years living in Belgium, I found this a really helpful guide book.  Prices are always wrong in guidebooks, but I found the contact information (web, address, phone) nearly always right, and the descriptions accurate.<br /><br />You will be very challenged to find another guidebook that has this level of coverage of Belgium in its entirety, as most seem to focus on Brussels, Gent, Bruges, and perhaps Antwerp.  Belgium seems to typically be an afterthought on most tourists' itineraries.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the author's picks, both hotels and restaurants.  What can I say to the other reviewer where the hotel unfortunately cancelled their booking because they found a group that would pay them more?  Is that the authors' fault?  No, welcome to Europe, and to Belgium, where the customer is always ... wrong!!<br /><br />So you're browsing guidebooks, and wondering which one to get?<br /><br />I would have to say, based on my experience using an earlier edition of this book for the past 3 years (I imagine they're pretty similar!), if you're swinging through Belgium for 2 days, and going to see Brussels and Bruges, this book is probably not the best for you.  You'll probably do better with a thinner city-specific guidebook.  But if you're going to tour around Belgium, or spend an extended amount of time in a city or two, then the in-depth coverage of this book is a real benefit.<br /><br />One criticim I do have to echo:  Lonely Planet, let's face it, is not known for its maps, and this book is no exception.  They're good enough, and I've never NOT been able to find something, but sometimes the maps, er, well, don't necessarily reflect reality.<br /><br />So all in all, this is a solid book, and if you follow my advice in paragraph 5, I think you'll be happy with it.", "images": [], "asin": "1741042372", "parent_asin": "1741042372", "user_id": "AFISQVMFNIG2GQF2Q4GYIXFZTSFQ", "timestamp": 1214337799000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "The will is weak", "text": "This book attempts to answer the question that has been hovering all over, not just in America, but across the world \u2013 Why have so few corporations been prosecuted for fraud? Eisinger begins by reminding us that that prior to 2008, especially at the turn of the 21st century, there have been notable prosecutions of white collar crime by the big boys. Arthur Anderson was first, and it was followed by the three big men of Enron Corporation itself, Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Andrew Fastow. Other Arthur Anderson clients, Sunbeam, Qwest, Boston Chicken, and WorldCom were also investigated.<br /><br /> But prosecuting white collar crimes is not like prosecuting drug trafficking and petty theft. First, as Eisinger says, \u2018White collar crime had to be invented\u2019. He quotes sociologist Edwin Sutherland that white collar crimes were \u2018committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation\u2019. Eisinger goes on to say that such crimes are \u2018nonviolent, economic crimes of fraud, collusion, or deception. Often it is not obvious the behavior is criminal. Embezzlement is as easy to understand as purse snatching. But securities fraud is a more abstract concept. An the historian Laurence Friedman sums up, \u2018The business of America is business; there was a certain lack of zeal for punishing business behaviour\u2019.<br /><br /> Hence, in spite of what we all now know about the recklessness of the people in charge of the banks and big corporations who played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis, there was hardly any prosecution of note. Eisinger traces the history of white collar prosecution, discussing the process of negotiated settlements that covers up most of the cases that might otherwise have ended in criminal trials. He explains the cause of the government\u2019s failure. Here he points a finger at Charles Schumer, the powerful New York senator, who, though not an enemy of regulation, \u2018subtly undermined it\u2019. Schumer picked Preet Bhara to be the US attorney for the powerful division of the Justice Department.<br /><br /> Eisinger says that \u2018Today the justice system is broken\u2026[the Justice Department] has become fearful of losing and lost sight of its fundamental mission to make this country a just place\u2019. Even prosecutions of smaller people and smaller corporations and not involving big banks \u2018face profound problems\u2019. This book is about all those problems. The title of this book was taken from a phrase used by the sacked Attorney-General, James Comey, when he took over the helm of the Justice Department in 2002. He used it in a speech, aimed at inspiring the law enforcement institution. Sadly, it fell on deaf ears.", "images": [], "asin": "1501121367", "parent_asin": "1501121367", "user_id": "AG2DS6RVU3U4YZTESLLKGDZO75SA", "timestamp": 1500305679048, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Bold effort to put Trump's presidency into fuller biographical context", "text": "Haberman has been reporting on Trump for years. On the negative side, sometimes she's let him use her to get out his own message in the New York Times. On the positive side, she appears to see through him now. When he says (in front of his aide) that he \"loves her\" and says she's \"like my psychiatrist\", she recognizes the tactic for exactly what it is--the usual schtick to ingratiate himself with someone and manipulate the message.<br /><br />This was heartening to see. There is less \"both sidesism\" than I expected, and more clear-eyed exposition of who this man is and the damage he has done to the country. As she points out, there was ample reason to not take him very seriously as a cartoonishly larger-than-life NY celebrity real estate developer/self promoter.  Now, however, he has become a serious historical force.  Like it or not, everyone needs to take Trump, his message and his \"movement\" seriously, and Haberman does--while providing many anecdotes that would be comical if they were not so alarming and so dangerous.  I haven't figured out yet if the 600+ pages are really necessary as it's a long slog at points. On the other hand, it's Trump, so probably the answer is \"yes\".

{"rating": 4, "title": "3 in 1...what a deal!!!", "text": "It's great when one of your best friends just happens to own a book shop. I found this trilogy of Nora's in the book shop and got a great deal on it. I think my favorite was Finding The Dream, with Laura Templeton & Michael Fury, probably because he's the handsome, dangerous type of guy that every woman wants to fall in love with.  And he struggled to be good enough for where he  finally ended up. And she was so level-headed in so many ways, except the creep of a husband she was married to. Laura struggles with her two daughters after she divorces their father, with the oldest blaming Laura for his departure. Kids can be so cruel when they don't understand. The story just took me to tears at times. Then too, I really enjoyed Daring to Dream with Margo and Josh Templeton. She finds out about her mother's one and only love, Margo's father, and Margo regains a relationship with her mother that she'd felt was lost. Margo is the beautiful, well-built woman that every man dreams about, but she's a wild child that Josh Templeton has long been waiting for to return home. The dialogue is great, both witty and warm at the same time. Margo is nearly bankrupt when she returns to Templeton House, but finds her roots again, not only with starting a new business, but also with her mother. Josh was my second favorite of the men in this trilogy. He's so cool.<br /><br />And then there's Holding The Dream with Kate and Byron. This story was okay, but not nearly the page-turner that the other two were. But Kate is an altogether different type of woman than Laura and Margo. It's the bond that holds them together as sisters, even though they aren't, that I really found endearing. This trilogy was great.

I actually felt like I was reading a story that could have been told about any real-life firehouse and the members who inhabit it.  I was slightly disappointed in the heroine at one point, because she veered into a stereotypical reaction that seemed out of character.  But that moment was actually small enough that it didn\u2019t affect her overall character.  All in all, this was an excellent story and I would definitely recommend it.

I LOOOVED the character Black Knife.  Jodi Meadows has a way with her male leads that draws you in with the first meeting.  The world building was adequate.  The world itself, fascinating and mysterious, however, our interaction with it as the reader was somewhat limited.  There are several novellas planned in the series, unfortunately, I do not think they will be enough to quell my desire to know more about the world and the ancillary characters involved in the story.  Overall, I did grow to really enjoy this novel and am sad that it is only a duology as I think there is so much material smooshed into this one book that could have been developed in a longer series.<br /><br />Final Recommendations:  if you love high fantasy, mysterious organizations, even more mysterious vigilantes, swoony romance, royal jerks, strange magic", "images": [], "asin": "0062317385", "parent_asin": "0062317385", "user_id": "AGKXACINPQNH5PBKKDYEUCOLVGDQ", "timestamp": 1430235318000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

However, if the only thing you've seen of Piers Anthony is his Xanth series that is so popular, then you may want to screen this for the kids. All of these books deal with adult issues. You can judge whether someone is mature enough to read it, but all the books in this series follow a girl who is suicidal, the older man she loves and who loves her and their various companions. They deal with issues like suicide, rape, sex, etc... They do it in good way that is relevant and fits into the story. The story is about a girl Coleen, who was raped at a party once. Her father is an adulterer and her mother is a drunk. She puts on a good act and is a very popular girl on the outside, but cuts her self and frequently contemplates suicide, though she's very smart. One day on the way home from school, she comes across a man passed out in a ditch. Her suicidal nature leads her to take him home. After learning a little of each others language, he says that he's from another world/mode and that he wants to take her to be his wife there. She doesn't believe him and he disappears. She believes him and realizes she's made a mistake and he realizes he shouldn't have left. The method he takes is random though and the only way to reliably get back to Coleen is by invoking a virtual mode. The rest of the story is about how Coleen and Darren are trying to find each other and get back to his mode. They continuously encounter problems and solve them with the help of their friends from the other anchor modes. The whole time Coleen is trying to deal with her issues so that she can be with Darren in a health relationship. So there are many different things going on in this series and I have just gone over the general gist so that I don't give anything away. Everything is done in a tasteful manner, but as I said it contains very adult subject matter.

{"rating": 3, "title": "I dunno, electricity is nice.", "text": "This review originally published on the DRTTMK website.<br /><br />It's kind of a maudlin book. The main character is the personification of a little house that is built out in the country. \"The man who built her so well said, 'This Little House shall never be sold for gold or silver and she will live to see our great-great-grandchildren's great-great-grandchildren living in her.\" It talks about how the house is in the countryside, and at night she watches the stars, and what it's like in the different seasons. She hears about the city and kind of wonders what it's like. \"One day the little house was surprised to see a horseless carriage coming down the winding country road.\" Then they build a road next to her, and build more houses and gas stations, and then more roads, apartments... Everything crowds around her, but no one wants to live in her so she just kind of stays there. There's a trolley that goes by her, and an elevated train in a subway, and then they tear down the apartments and tenements next to her and build up skyscrapers, and she feels terrible and nobody's living in her and she's all broken down. Then one day, \"Along came the great-great-granddaughter of the man who built the little house so well.\" And she says, 'Hey, it looks kind of like my grandmother's house when she was a little girl, except that was out in the countryside.' And they realize that the area used to be countryside, but isn't anymore. Then they go to some movers and the movers say, 'Yeah, the house is well built so we can move the house somewhere else.' So they put her on a truck and take her out in the middle of the countryside and paint her and fix her up and then she's happy again.<br /><br />It's another one of those books decrying industrialization. If you think about it, that little house built back before cars and before any roads were in the area wouldn't have had air conditioning or central heat. It probably didn't even have indoor plumbing if it was so isolated. Obviously, it could be retrofitted, but the book just seems nostalgic for the past, like it's saying that things were better back when everything was countryside and we didn't have roads and cars and things like that. But there's so many trade-offs that it doesn't take into account, and it's a very simplistic and naive way of looking at the world. It just boils down to a house that likes living in the country, and then the country changes to a city, and then somebody takes her back to the country so she's happy again. Looking at it from the house's standpoint, it's a perfectly reasonable story. It's not great, but not bad. And it's rather dated.<br /><br />Message: Some houses prefer to be in the countryside.", "images": [], "asin": "039525938X", "parent_asin": "039525938X", "user_id": "AH4XKRSSSWAO6CZ5WH66V6PIQJTA", "timestamp": 1566913208013, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Dame Agatha visits the supernatural", "text": "This series of interlocking short stories is unusual in that Christie's mysteries usually centered on the everyday aspects of life, whether they were set in a small village or some exotic location the mystery usually revolved around the average, mundane bits of daily life.  Except for her few plots involving mysterious Master Criminals, a reader could quite easily imagine the story taking place in the house down the block or at last year's vacation spot but this one is very different.<br /><br />The stories begin quite conventionally, Mr. Satterthwaite is a wealthy, elderly bachelor.  He knows everybody and even though he is a bit of a busybody and gossip, they either know or want to know him.  His life has been and is interesting and fun but Satterthwaite has begun to feel that perhaps he has been missing something, at this point he mets the enigmatic Harley Quin.  Mr. Quin will listen to what Satterthwaite has to say and then just make a comment or two that will point Satterthwaite in the direction of something quite interesting.  As a result of these encounters Satterthwaite rights some wrongs, solves some crimes and reunites lost loves.<br /><br />It is never quite clear whether Mr. Quin is real or not.  He manages to just appear at a critical moment, and to know just the right bit of information to set Satterthwaite in the right direction and then disappears.  At times Quin is visible to, and interacts with others, but at others only Satterthwaite can see him.<br /><br />Even though there is a touch of the supernatural about these stories Christie, as always, plays fair with the reader.  The clues are all present to solve the mysteries in these stories although the true focus here is on the romance rather than the puzzle.  This is a charming set of stories, perfect to read on a lazy summer afternoon but if you are looking for a challenging mystery look elsewhere.", "images": [], "asin": "0312981600", "parent_asin": "0312981600", "user_id": "AHXWUCTMVBQXDVMDFPA3NO43QF2Q", "timestamp": 1150811457000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Ruth is not an organized storyteller so readers expecting a linear storyline might be disappointed. However", "text": "I had ordered the book as part of my Book of the Month subscription, excited by the synopsis. While the novel gets off to a slow start early on, it begins to pick up the pace, and you can't help but want to continue reading. There is a tender melancholy that begins to pull you in.<br /><br />Fresh off a broken engagement, Ruth quits her job and moves back home to take care of her dementia-addled father. Told via journal-style, we follow Ruth as she explores her relationships with her family, friendships, even the unsteady footing of a new romance. Ruth is not an organized storyteller so readers expecting a linear storyline might be disappointed. However, I found that it worked in the novel's favor.<br /><br />I liked that we didn't dwell too deeply in the far past. I think had the author done that, I would have been taken out of the story fairly quickly. We stay in the present with Ruth, as she reflects on the end of her engagement with Joel, her re-readings of her father's diary entries. Howard, a history professor, is witty and human, and certain interactions just break your heart. As you get to the end of the novel, it begins to feel like it's speeding up, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />For a novel with a heavy subject matter, it didn't feel overwhelming or depressing.

Fun!<br /><br />We see some of the same themes in this book as we did in the first two. Renna's, Brandi's, Jaimie's, and Leith's faith will be put to the test. Renna has the realization that she's been trying too hard to fix things, and she has to let God take control. Brandi thinks she has to be the happy one, and it nearly crushes her. Leith decides he is willing to sacrifice anything to help the ones he loves. All realize that people, even Respen, aren't the true enemy, and that God can call anyone to be His child.<br /><br />I don't like torture. I like when characters are in pain (wounded, not crippled, dying but knowing they'll recover), but I don't like torture. It's messy and ugly. Thankfully, TM glosses over most of the gory stuff. People are whipped and burned and bandaged.<br /><br />Brandi's deception didn't work for me, deciding to join the army.  She doesn't know how to fight!<br /><br />I liked that the king lived, that Leith saved his life by failing to kill him.<br /><br />The romance was good. I liked that they did a lot of hand-holding (Brandi noticed there was so much hand-holding!) rather than a lot of kissing. I don't feel like there was one conversation where they sat and talked enough to get on the same page with their feelings and hopes, though. They both just assumed they liked each other and went from there.<br /><br />Writer thoughts:<br />I love the naming scheme TM has going here. Dare, Deny, and Defy. 1, they're all four-letter D words. 2, they're all verbs of resistance. 3, they progress from mild refusal to outright rebellion. 4, they explain Leith's character growth and the plot all in one.

He covered information about our atmosphere, air, winds, heat, and clouds, and how it all works together to create weather.<br /><br />The author has a gift for making difficult ideas very easy to understand. He also included many black and white illustrations that reinforced what was taught in the text and made it clear. The book was packed full of practical information on how to become weather-wise. This book was first written some time ago (in 1949) and was based off of articles that the author wrote for sailors and aviators. Most of the information is still completely relevant, but it does show it's age in a few places.<br /><br />I'd highly-recommend this well-written and interesting book to anyone who's curious about how weather is created and how to predict it.", "images": [], "asin": "0486443574", "parent_asin": "0486443574", "user_id": "AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA", "timestamp": 1277225581000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

The setting is a Human Resources department in a New-York-based consumer research corporation, which has gone through several rounds of &#34;down-sizing&#34; due to the economic climate.  The novel opens in late 2009 with another round on the horizon.<br /><br />Rosa Guerrero is the Executive VP/Human Resources Chief who has devoted 15 years of her career to the corporation.  A childless widow, estranged from her siblings, she is approaching retirement, but dreads the loss of her purpose in life and her work &#34;family.&#34;  Rosa has been a stellar leader with the ability to balance corporate goals with human needs.  Consequently, she is well-respected and has engendered loyalty from the CEO and her staff.  In the midst of the looming reorganization, Rosa suffers a health crisis that compromises her mental faculties.<br /><br />The author has captured a cross-section of human nature with the characterization of the staff, ranging from caring to cunning, compassionate to cruel, committed to apathy.  In other words, this is a typically flawed collection of humans forming a sometimes productive, yet dysfunctional work &#34;family.&#34;  The characters are interesting and well-developed, but oddly I didn't seem to form an emotional connection with any of them.<br /><br />My one criticism is that the plotline got bogged down in repetition.

She doesn't cook unless she has to, and even then, she takes *gasp* shortcuts.  Meeting Mike Flynn at her sister's wedding, she is at once intrigued and surprised by the feelings he invokes in her.  She can't help but notice how much he favors her now deceased fianc\u00e9, and while it unnerves her, she is still attracted to him enough that she wants to see what happens.  Plus, there is nothing like a good mystery, and Annabelle is determined to get to the bottom of this one.<br /><br />Mike Flynn has been taught by his mother from an early age to take care of himself.  He doesn't mind cooking and cleaning and running a household. Life as a physician doesn't give him much opportunity to do so, but when he does, he relishes being able to take care of someone he likes.  Annabelle Ronaldi is such a person.  Meeting her at her sister's wedding, he is instantly enchanted and utterly charmed by her.  Their explosive night together makes him even surer of his decision to woo the beautiful and sassy Annabelle Ronaldi.<br /><br />Family secrets and lies are the name of the game in TOO HOT TO HANDLE.  Annabelle lost her fianc\u00e9 to tragedy, and at her sister's wedding, she meets a man that could be his twin.  Intrigued by, but also attracted to Mike Flynn makes Annabelle want to keep him for her very own. The fact that he is the exact type of man she desires plays heavy on her mind, and she falls for the handsome doctor.  Their sinfully sexy first night together was sensuous and heady.  Both characters fell hard for each other, and that in turn made this story that much more entertaining.<br /><br />Robin Kaye spins the tale of Mike and Annabelle in such a way that I felt their emotional ties and their lusty thoughts.  From Annabelle's fun loving Italian-to-the-bone family to Mike's single but dedicated and loving mother, I didn't miss a single breathtaking word of this fine novel.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Outstanding collection of interviews and articles", "text": "Around the 1950's, the studio system of Japanese film started to show cracks.  Not large cracks, but big enough that a few ambitious rebels could squeeze their fingers in, and start breaking molds and showing their own individual styles.  Crazy psychedelic colors, hot warrior chicks with big floppy hats and big guns, rice-sniffing assassins...Japanese film got a whole lot more interesting.<br /><br />Author Chris Desjardins describes these \"outlaw masters\" as \"the directors coming out of the Japanese production lines of the late fifties, the sixties and the early seventies: genre filmmakers who made genre movies usually labeled as samurai, yakuza, horror, pink, etc, but who pushed the envelope beyond the usual conventions in some way, either in style or content. \"  These are the men and women who didn't mind working in the \"b-films\" because of the freedom it gave them to create their own vision and keep pushing boundaries of sex, violence, politics and style.<br /><br />In much the same way as [[ASIN:1903254434 No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema]], \"Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film\" springs from a series of film festivals and director retrospectives, in this case from The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles.  Film programmer Dennis Bartok and author Chris Desjardins shared a passion for the edgy, hard-boiled cinema that came from Japan during these times, and the actors and directors who exemplified it.  They put together the \"Outlaw Masters\" series starting in 1997, and have been bringing these fantastic films to a wider audience ever since.<br /><br />This film festival gave them insight and access to these directors, many of whom were not even aware that their work was appreciated outside of Japan.  Each section of this book contains a short biography and filmography, followed by an interview.  There are fourteen featured in all, twelve directors and two actors.  Some of these, like Fukusaku Kinji ([[ASIN:B000F4LPJ6 Battle Royale]], [[ASIN:B0002V7O1A Battles Without Honor & Humanity]]), Sonny Chiba ([[ASIN:B00006JMRZ Street Fighter Saga]], [[ASIN:B00068ULLY Kill Bill]]), Suzuki Seijun ([[ASIN:B0000YAEI4 Underworld Beauty]], [[ASIN:0780022041 Tokyo Drifter]]) and Okamoto Kihachi ([[ASIN:B0007989YS The Sword of Doom]]).  Some, like Kaji Meiko ([[ASIN:B000AYNFV2 Lady Snowblood]]) and Ichii Teruo ([[ASIN:B000RHMQJE Horrors of Malformed Men]]) are a little more obscure except to hardcore fans. As well as these classic film-folk, two of Japan's \"modern outlaws\" are included as well, Miike Takashi (Ichi the Killer) and Kurosawa Kiyoshi (Cure).<br /><br />All of them are fascinating, giving intelligent and informed interviews.  Many of these interviews, in fact, are featured in video form as bonus features on some of these director's DVDs.  I know I have seen a few of them, but it is a real treasure to have them all collected in book form.<br /><br />It is also fantastic to live in the age of the DVD.  If I had picked up \"Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film\" a few years ago, I probably would have been frustrated at the lack of access to all of these cool flicks I was reading about.  Nowadays, however, almost all of them are only a search away.

It starts with with a dead body and then it gets a bit lost within itself for just a little while. When it picks up though, it really picks up.<br />When Paris Secord, otherwise known as DJ ParSec, is found dead the local music scene is thrown into mourning. Two of her best friends, one before fame, Kya, and one after, Fuse, already completely despise each other but things soon get a lot worse between them. Not only did they both discover the body together they also find themselves in a huge mess when some extremist followers of DJ ParSec decide to take things into their own hands when the police aren't able to do their jobs.<br />I won't tell you more about this because it all happens in stages and phases that you have to read in sequence for it all to come together so perfectly.<br />This story is very well written but there are times when things happen that leave you scratching your head for a bit.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Taut, Smart, Dramatic Little Thriller", "text": "It's not hard to see why Hitchcock made John Buchan's \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" into a film (which I have not seen).  It's a taut, smart, dramatic little thriller, full of the unlikely events Hitch really grooved on.  I was quite pleased at the end of this breezy novel, which is a pretty obvious source of LeCarre, Fleming, et al.  It's also a marvelous example of fiction incorporating the zeit geist of the era in which it was written.<br /><br />Richard Hannay, late of South Africa, finds himself terribly bored in London, 1914 (which, having been to London, can't possibly imagine), until he meets the mysterious Franklin Scudder.  Allowing Scudder to live in his home, Hannay is astonished by Scudder's bizarre raving tale of an elaborate conspiracy to initiate war among the European powers.  Hannay takes this story with a bit of skeptisism until he comes home one night to find Scudder pinned to the floor by a knife.  Thus begins an elaborate and episodic chase, as Hannay, fully believing Scudder's claims, must run from the police and from the conspiracy, the Black Stone.<br /><br />Buchan is most successful in creating Hannay's elaborate schemes and escapes.  Hannay is a likeable hero, so the reader readily roots for him.  Further, the villains, while never fully developed (it is Hannay's story), make for sinister threats just off-page, so to speak.  The denouement is satisfying, if more than a little tragic.<br /><br />This book is also fascinating because the conspiracy, with changes in detail, basically mirrors the events that ignited World War I.  Various radical interests seek to assassinate a prominent figure (although Princip had no idea of the consequences of assassinating Franz Ferdinand), and trip the various political alliances to start a war.  Thus, Buchan incorporates the weird mixture of patriotism and panic that most historians point to when they chronicle the First World War.<br /><br />The downside of that zeit geist is that Buchan incorporates a certain level of anti-Semitism, some of it being of dubious necessity.  Scudder is convinced that Jews are responsible, because they want Russia to be destroyed by the war.  While we later learn that Scudder had prejudices against Jews, Scudder himself acknowledges the anti-Semitic history of Russia.  Another occasion, Hannay makes an analogy that plays on the stereotypes of Jews as being wealthy.  Again, that is probably an accurate reflection of the times, but it is uncomfortable.  To Buchan's credit, the conspiracy is more than simply an \"evil Jewish plot\" (it's telling that some of the rhetoric Buchan uses is still floating around today).<br /><br />Nonetheless, as with most older literature, you have to take the prejudices in context of when the book was written.  \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" is not an heir to the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".  It is an exciting thriller, featuring a heavy does of suspense and intrigue.  Simply put, it's a blast.", "images": [], "asin": "0486282015", "parent_asin": "0486282015", "user_id": "AFTRQJPXDBG2C5LKZWPUU4EC3YVQ", "timestamp": 1103933483000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Jake Blake Goes for a Wild Ride", "text": "First published in 1956, Wild Wives is a short but very entertaining novel from Charles Willeford, the author of Miami Blues and a number of other crime novels.<br /><br />Jake Blake is a struggling San Francisco P.I. who lives in the same cheap hotel where he has his office. One slow afternoon, Florence Weintraub, the inevitable Hot Babe essential to the beginning of practically any classic P.I. story, waltzes into his office insisting that she's desperately in need of his help. Even though she's twenty-six years old, her father allows her absolutely no freedom whatsoever and has her accompanied wherever she goes by two goons who are allegedly there to protect her. She'd just like a couple of hours to herself, she says. Could Jake possibly help her lose the two thugs?<br /><br />Well, of course he can, for twenty-five bucks a day plus expenses. And when the lovely Florence agrees to the terms, one thing inevitably leads to another. Florence is very attracted to Jake and once they finally elude her guardians, they go out to dinner, which Jake naturally adds to the expense account. Other more interesting activities accompany the dinner, and Florence insists that she'd like to see Jake again the following day.<br /><br />Complications ensue and poor Jake soon finds himself entangled in a mess he never envisioned when he accepted Florence's seemingly simple assignment. It's an engaging story with plenty of Willeford's deadpan humor and enough action to propel the story forward at a fairly rapid clip. While not quite on a par with some of Willeford's better known books, it's still a fun read and will appeal especially to those who have read and enjoyed the author's other work.", "images": [], "asin": "1400032474", "parent_asin": "1400032474", "user_id": "AFR34VATA3I43FGP3RQVEBA6TO4A", "timestamp": 1428529943000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Laugh-tastic!", "text": "This book tries to teach manners (no idea if it's successful), and avoids being totally condescending and didactic by putting them all in the case of bizarre, childish make-believe scenarios. What do you say when you're walking backwards to town (because you like to do that) and bump into an alligator? What do you say when you're flying your plane and remember the Duchess asked you to drop in, so you do and break her roof?<br /><br />It's silliness incarnate, and you have to love it!<br /><br />There are three scenarios in particular that reviewers have commented on, so let's tackle those.<br /><br />The first is the \"decapitation\". In this case you're asked what you say when you're out picking flowers in front of your castle, a dragon appears and breathes smoke at you, and then a knight saves you by chopping off its head. (You say thank you.)<br /><br />There's no blood or anything gory shown, and as far as I'm concerned the princess being saved from the dragon by the knight is a common fairy tale set-up. I don't have a problem with this. There are more violent scenes in both classic and recent Disney animated films, nobody is claiming the dragon was talking and friendly and just violently attacked - I have no problem with this scene for this age group. Let's move on.<br /><br />The next one is where you are a cowboy. Suddenly the bad guy shows up and holds a gun to your head and asks \"Would you like me to shoot a hole in your head?\" (You say \"no thank you\", which strikes me as perfectly sensible.)<br /><br />This one is a bit trickier. I'll be honest and skip ahead a bit by saying I, personally have no problem with ANY of this book - but in this case I can really see why some people do. The scene is a bit explicit, and the Western is no longer a popular form of drama anyway so it's not like this situation is likely to have come up in your child's play.<br /><br />However, as nobody actually gets hurt, I'd say most kids won't even notice to be upset. There's more violent scenes on cartoons in the morning.<br /><br />And the last one that people have complained about is the one where you're a pirate and have captured a lady and tied her up. Every morning when you untie her to eat breakfast she says \"Good morning, how are you?\" and you are supposed to say the same.<br /><br />As far as this goes... meh. Clearly nobody is being particularly ill-treated.<br /><br />Now, overall, I don't mind any of these scenes because I know quite a few children. This sort of thing and more is exactly what they come up with when they're playing pretend. If you think children do not play-act violence you are very much mistaken. They do. They do it because it's exciting. They do it because it's fun to practice being really bad in a safe way that doesn't actually harm anyone, when in real life they work so hard to be GOOD. They do it because these things scare them and playing them makes them less scary. They do because the stories they are exposed to have violence there, explicit or implied, and they want to understand that. They do because you can't have a good story without a villain.<br /><br />And children have been doing this for as long as there have been children to play pretend at all. I do not believe that this is in any way linked to actual violence when these children grow up.<br /><br />Obviously if your child is bothered by this sort of pretend violence, don't read them this book. Or if you are. However, truthfully, I don't think it's that big a deal in this context.", "images": [], "asin": "0064431126", "parent_asin": "0064431126", "user_id": "AF3B7N46YKJFHVZJWAKKCUIDO6HQ", "timestamp": 1272772694000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 5, "title": "The subjectivity that holds it back also makes it exceptional", "text": "It's hard to entirely explain Into Thin Air and why it works, especially since the very elements that make the book work as well as it does are also the ones that hold it back, in some ways. Into Thin Air is the story of what was, until recently, the deadliest day on Mount Everest. It's not an event that's easily summarized, nor one where there are clear lessons to learn; yes, there was a horrific storm, but there are countless other factors, from oxygen deprivation to overconfidence, from medical conditions to isolationist groups, from bad planning to human error. That makes for a sprawling story, and a shapeless one at times, and what it needs is someone able to take all of this information and process it coldly. Instead, we get Krakauer, a notable nonfiction author who was on Everest at the time of the expedition and, in ways both direct and indirect, contributed to some of the disaster. Krakauer's involvement means that Into Thin Air is never a cold or dispassionate work, and while Krakauer does a superb job of explaining the background and the context that's led to the commercialization of Everest (an aspect of the book which was fascinating to me), this is as much writing as catharsis or confession as it is storytelling. The result is a book that's a very subjective account of a nightmarish situation, with Krakauer trying as much to explain what happened to himself as to any audience. It's a fascinating book, largely because the very thing that makes the book so powerful and effective - Krakauer's involvement - is the same thing that keeps the book from attaining the focus or clarity that might make it better in some ways. And yet, I think the personal element is what makes Into Thin Air so gripping, as we experience both the confusion and chaos of the mountain as well as Krakauer's deep and inescapable guilt about the part he may have played in the disaster. It's a quietly haunting read, and while there may be better nonfiction looks at what happened, it's hard to imagine them being as painful as this is, or as memorable.", "images": [], "asin": "B000FC1ITK", "parent_asin": "B000FC1ITK", "user_id": "AESESBLLG3ZZISQONG5SOAEUGC3Q", "timestamp": 1434471525000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Story is pretty basic but illustrations are delightful.", "text": "Nothing new or ground-breaking here, just a sweet little story about a shy little squirrel making new friends by attending a party. There are parts which may strike you as a bit clunky and odd-sounding, and I suspect that this might have flowed a bit more smoothly in the original French. For example:<br /><br /> &#34;..Ant asked the seagull what the vast emptiness of sea and sky was like (Because it's so mysterious...this emptiness!)&#34; Your preschooler won't be the only one puzzled by phrases like that.<br /><br />In addition, much is made of the mysterious 'nothing tart'  which will be served at the party. Ant asks Harry the bear will there be a tart? What sort? Harry says it will be a 'nothing tart'. Next page: ant's mouth waters just thinking about the 'mysterious' nothing tart. Next page: Harry is &#34;still thinking about the nothing tart&#34;. He tells George the owl that &#34;the evening would be absolutely unforgettable because of the wonderful nothing tart.&#34; Next page: George wonders what sort of costume goes with a nothing tart. Several pages later, at the party, ant is speaking &#34;between bites of nothing tart.&#34; That's it. Never mentioned again. Was that supposed to be funny? I don't get it.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the illustrations, very brightly colored and done in a retro early-1960s style. An extra star just for those.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Life After Life", "text": "Hey, wait a minute, didn't I just review this? No, but I came upon it when reviewing another book of the same title by Aminatta Forna. And my review title is borrowed from two other novels that have also recently appeared (by Kate Atkinson and Jill McCorkle). Both titles are eminently suited to Linda Olsson's new novel, though it is smaller in scale and less ambitious in theme than any of the others.<br /><br />I have greatly enjoyed Olsson's previous novels, [[ASIN:0143038079 ASTRID AND VERONIKA]] and [[ASIN:0143114700 SONATA FOR MIRIAM]], for the quiet interiority of her writing. I have also admired her ability to use the sparse landscapes of Sweden or New Zealand as a foil for the emotional lives of her mostly female characters. Both countries play a part here. The actual setting is the thinly-populated New Zealand coast southwest of Auckland on the North Island, where Marion Flint, a woman in early middle age, semi-retired physician and part-time artist, has fled to handle some nameless grief alone; there are hints of a deceased husband or lover. But most of the memories that return to her in italicized flashbacks of increasing frequency are of her childhood, first on an idyllic island between Sweden and Finland, and later in Stockholm and London. It is clear that Marion is an emotionally damaged woman, though it will be a long time before we discover exactly how the various phases of her life connect up.<br /><br />The catalyst is a small boy called Ika, who begins drifting into her life, visiting most Thursdays. He appears to be somewhat autistic and uncommunicative, but he has real gifts for art and for music. [Music plays a significant part here as in Olsson's other books, Bill Evans' \"Peace Piece\" especially setting the tone for the latter part of the novel.] The book has a slow beginning, but then something happens that accelerates both Marion's present-day actions and the flood of her memories. She finds herself having to reach out to her neighbors, take actions that might have legal consequences, and come to terms with what Ika means in her life.<br /><br />The book is very much about second, third, and even fourth chances, starting another life after the previous one had effectively ended. We will learn about traumas that effectively tore Marion's childhood life into three separate fragments, and we will see them echoed in the painful fissures that ripped apart her adult one. My only complaint about the novel is that these reflections are just too obviously planned. You notice this at first in a too-close parallel between casual events in the present and the memories that they trigger. Later, the story comes to depend on one huge coincidence and a number of minor ones that would be enough to make some readers I know throw the book at the wall in disgust. But not me. For I know Olsson to be a musician, and if she wants to compose a novel as one might a sonata, with themes and variations and recapitulation, then I am willing to accept the artifice. Besides, I had come to care for the people, and ended the book with tears in my eyes. Tears of contentment.

Therefore rich people get richer faster than ordinary wage earners and income inequality inexorably rises.\u201d<br /><br />Its only solution: \u201cTake more from the rich in the form of wealth taxes\u201d  But, even Piketty concedes that this is a \u201cutopian idea\u201d but also insists that it is the best possible solution to the problem, yet he hedges on the precise numbers.<br /><br />Even Piketty recognizes the obvious political infeasibility of such a plan, He has nothing to say about the practical difficulties, distorting effects, and potential for abuse that would inevitably accompany such intense government control of the economy. He neglects the fact that in the long run, taxes of that level would surely lower investments in human capital and the creation of new businesses. And, He fails to recognize one crucial implication of his own argument about the power of non-diminishing capital returns: if capital is so mobile and dynamic that it can avoid diminishing returns, as Piketty claims, then it will probably also avoid being taxed, which means that the search for tax revenue will have to shift elsewhere, and governments will find that soaking the rich does not really work.", "images": [], "asin": "067443000X", "parent_asin": "067443000X", "user_id": "AFY4RK3KVSMBU4WVHCWZJ7ZHF2DQ", "timestamp": 1398484169000, "helpful_vote": 74, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 2, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 4, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I was really moved by the writing in this book. S. Walden did an amazing job evoking emotion with her writing. Brooke is such a strong young lady. Even though some of the things she did were pretty dangerous and I wouldn't recommend her course of action, I completely understand why she felt like she needed to. I can't even imagine losing my best friend the way she lost hers. This book is about her journey really. Sure, there is also the \"secret club of jerks\" storyline that she is trying to get to the bottom to, but for me it was much more about justice for Beth and closure for Brooke.<br /><br />Brooke is completely weighed down by her guilt for most of the book. She feels responsible for her best friends death because of certain things that happened before her death. But no one else blames Brooke. She only blames herself. And because of this guilt she hatches a plan to avenge Beth. And she spends most of the book figuring out a way to do it. Along the way, she meets Ryan and they seemed like magnets. They were instantly drawn to each other. Even though they both tried to keep their distance, they just couldn't stay away for long. But Ryan and Brooke each had their own secrets. (just like everyone else at the school, it seemed). There were a few twists and turns and theories thrown around at various points in the story but I thought it was pretty clear what was really going on. There wasn't too much mystery surrounding the secret club, but I still loved the way the story flowed.<br /><br />Nothing felt forced, or rushed. The writing was descriptive and beautiful really. Going Under is a very powerful book. The strength that you see in Brooke is beautiful. She is someone that you are rooting for the whole time. I just loved her.

{"rating": 4, "title": "A cynical classic", "text": "The Battle of Britain. Dashing, fearless young patriots out of Shakespeare take to their machines to save Albion from Nazi bombers. Battling hopeless odds and a vastly superior enemy, these lions of the sky prevail against evil, save democracy, and land back at base in time for their tea.<br /><br />Or not.<br /><br />Derek Robinson's \"Piece of Cake\" has to be one of the most brutally cynical, myth-debunking pieces of historical fiction ever put to pen. In its 650+ pages it methodically, and at times gleefully, ravages the heroic sterotype of Britain's fighter pilots cemented by the hundreds of books, movies, and documentaries which have come out since the war. In the language of the book, it puts paid to all that bumf and tells the truth --or rather, Robinson's version of it.<br /><br />\"Cake\" is the story of Hornet Squadron, a rather average collection of fighter pilots flying Hurricanes, between September 1939 and September 1940. It details their involvement in the \"phoney war,\" the Battle of France and lastly, the Battle of Britain. From the very first chapter, when a number of the pilots wreck their car while driving home drunk from a pub, then steal a tractor, and finally horses, to get back to their base, the reader begins to realize that we few, we happy few, we band of brothers, is nowhere to be found here. With the occasional exception, Hornet Squadron is a collection of snobbish, selfish, sophomoric, not-too-terribly bright adrenaline junkies who joined the RAF in the hopes of blowing things up without legal consequences. It's a case of be careful what you wish for, times two.<br /><br />For a story with so many characters -- the squadron has more than a dozen, and chaps are always getting knocked off and replaced -- Robinson does a terrific job of keeping them all fresh and distinct from each other. Each reader will have his own favorite \"good\" guy -- goodhearted flight leader Fanny Barton, the cold-blooded American volunteer Christopher Hart (\"CH3\"), the crazy as a loon Flash Gordon, or possibly the non-fighting duo of \"Uncle\" Kellaway (the squadron adj) and his sidekick, an Oxford don turned intelligence officer \"Skull\" Skellen, who spend a lot of time arguing about squirrels. There is no question about the squadron's biggest bastard -- not since \"GoodFellas\" Joe Pesci/Tommy DeVito did I hate somebody as much as Lance \"Moggy\" Cattermole, the big, smooth-talking sociopath who seems to enjoy tormenting and using his squadron mates even more than he likes to machine-gun German pilots as they hang helpless in their parachutes. Robinson takes positive delight in showing how how Hart's theory that \"up there the world is divided into bastards and suckers\" also applies on terra firma.<br /><br />\"Piece of Cake\" was a contraversial book not only for its thoroughly unglamorous depiction of the RAF jocks but because it expands on the touchy and undiscussed issue of the RAF's kill claims. The pilots, who in fairness can hardly be blamed for making mistakes given the nature of air combat prior to the installation of the gun camera, claimed about 2.5 German aircraft destroyed for every one that actually was. The vastly overstated statistics issued by the RAF made their way into the postwar literature and contributed to the mythos surrounding the battle. In point of fact, the Germans had about 900 fighters to the Brits 600, and the Me 109 was badly hampered by its extremely short range and the necessity to try and protect the bombers. The odds were somewhat closer than the Brits care to believe.<br /><br />\"Piece of Cake\" wasn't written to disparage the courage of the British pilots or denigrate their accomplishments, but to show them for what they were -- young, often immature officer-boys of varying character who sometimes died stupid and futile deaths. In other words, human beings at war. In this sense, Robinson does the RAF a favor, for heroism is much more impressive when it comes from real people rather than Hollywood cartoons.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Slow start but a good coming-of-age tale", "text": "Initially, I found The Wish Maker a difficult book to follow.  The beginning has a tendency to meander and ramble a bit so I found it hard at times to follow the narrative thread.  It took me a while to understand that the first chapter takes place in the present while subsequent chapters take place in the past.  My major quibble about the book would be with the timeline because it is hard to tell at times whether the events described take place in the present or past.<br /><br />Once I got past my confusion, though, I found the book to be an interesting coming-of-age tale.  It centers mostly around Zaki and Samar, who are cousins but are brought up almost like siblings.  Much of the book describes their childhood and it's a childhood that isn't all that different from an American childhood.  However, it is set against a background of some major historical events in Pakistan.  It's interesting how these events are treated almost casually but it also makes sense that they would be treated thus.  The characters, like most of us, are concerned with their day-to-day events and so, even though these historical events are important to them, they sometimes take a backseat to the characters' more immediate concerns.<br /><br />Another aspect of the novel that I found interesting were the ways in which Western culture has influenced Pakistan in the past and continues to influence it today.  I found a scene in a Pizza Hut to be particularly vivid and it makes for a nice reminder of how taking one small piece of a culture can lead to a somewhat warped view of the whole.<br /><br />Sethi has a nice voice and spins a good yarn.  However, I think he could benefit from some brevity and a bit more clarity.  I had a hard time getting through the first part of the book and even put it aside for a while and read a couple of books in between.  I'm glad that I persisted with it but had the narrative been tighter right from the beginning, I would probably have enjoyed the novel more.  The risk is that not every reader will persist and I think that would be a shame because I ultimately found this to be a good story about the impact of family relationships and how they shape individuals.", "images": [], "asin": "1594488754", "parent_asin": "1594488754", "user_id": "AEHGCBDKAVKSK5UW6PJQL6JJWG7A", "timestamp": 1245290694000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Instead, this book is more about violence that took place during the Russian's occupation of Chechnya, and how it played out on the ground for some ordinary villagers, as well as a Russian female doctor.  But after I finished the book, and started thinking on the story more, I had(have) to admit it's really rather a good book.  Really brings to life all of the main characters (i.e. Sonja, the doctor, Havaa, a villager who loses her family, and Akhmed, the man who saves her by bringing her to Sonja).  I am more of a political person, and so have read all about the violence perpetrated on the Chechen population by the Russians, and the various &#34;holy war&#34; battles by the Chechens in response.  So I think I was accepting more stories along those lines.  Instead, the main character, Sonja, is Russian, and prior to this book I knew very little about Russians who had been &#34;resettled&#34; in Chechnya.  So learning more about that community was fascinating.  In addition, I had known very little about the &#34;disappearances&#34; of ordinary Chechens in an effort to get them to report on their neighbors (rather like the disappearances of large populations in various Latin American countries), so that was quite interesting too.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Escaping to a Fantasy World", "text": "When we first meet heroine Altana, she is a precocious, stubborn 5-year old whose sense of fairness is easily offended. After a particularly humiliating episode in which she is reprimanded (instead of adored as usual) by her teacher, she is magically transported to a strange land full of strange beings. It is pretty plain that she is not in Kansas (in this case, New York) any more. Altana makes a friend who introduces her to her family and the foreign customs of the land, which is called Ilmarinen.  There are magical plants and talking centaurs.  Healing (or the practice of  medicine) is forbidden. Young readers will follow with excitement as Altana encounters one dangerous situation after another. Just before disaster strikes, Altana awakes in her home world, where no one believes a word about her fantastical journeys. The years pass, and we see Altana go on to middle school and high school.  Her mundane world is marked by the customary rites of passage.  Middle schoolers bully her,  and she feels the sting of personal betrayal. At crucial times, Altana either escapes (or is she summoned?) back to Ilmarinen, where she is destined to fulfill a prophecy which will free the inhabitants from a ruling despot.  Before I finished it, my one reservation about recommending this story for youg readers was that it seemed  that Altana had not even a modicum of modesty. Alas, I judged too soon!  Before the surprising conclusion,  Altana gains insights that endeared her to me.

I enjoy in-depth character development, and find it all too often missing in many books today.  Loose ends and contradictions drive me bonkers. So to find that there weren't any obvious loose ends in this book and the characters were wonderfully developed along the journey, not by tedious outside descriptions, but by their actions, choices and even their turn of phrase, made me a very happy reader. The action was well treated as well, and all of it kept me up reading more pages at night than I had started out intending to read.<br /><br />I respect the author's different views on relationships and marriage, so the only criticism I have is based on personal preference: I would have preferred that the love interests in the story would have taken the plunge and gotten married, rather than just had sex.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Major Disappointment", "text": "I love \"Chinatown,\" and I love the BFI Film Classic series (at least the ones I've read up to now).  I found this one to be cringe-worthy, and not much more than a fustian, droning, classroom theoretical lecture on film noir, femme fatales, Oedipal heroes (yes!) and on and on and on.  The author is allegedly a professional film screenwriter, and although I've worked in feature film production for over 30 years, I've never heard of a single film that is attributed to him.  The entire monograph is about \"theory,\" and \"theoretical patterns.\"  There is ZERO discussion about the actual screenplay, apart from a few glancing references, and ZERO discussion about the actual production of the film itself.  And this latter element, is where ANY film is REALLY made - the split-second changes that are forced on a production crew because of location problems, actor problems, scheduling problems, script problems, etc., etc.  When I was a teen and young adult, I avidly read film magazines, and thought they were so complex and intellectual and bursting with ideas.  Then I started working in film production and realized what a bunch of malarkey all this film theory is!  Disillusioning, yeah, but so what?  Films are produced through hell and high water, and every single one that gets made (even the awful ones) is a miracle.

{"rating": 5, "title": "The Classic Work on D-Day", "text": "An instant classic when originally published in 1959, The Longest Day continues to stand the test of time. As a first time reader I can fully understand the praise and longevity this volume has achieved.<br /><br />Cornelius Ryan was born in 1920 in Dublin, Ireland. While he didn\u2019t experience the fighting first hand he did experience the war from close quarters. During the war he served as a correspondent and flew in bombing missions with the U.S. Air Force and also covered the D-Day landings. This first hand knowledge of events no doubt served him well in the years it took to research and write this account.<br /><br />Ryan went directly to the sources for much of his research. He used war documents from many countries, used diaries from Generals and other military figures, and interviewed literally hundreds of participants, both soldiers and civilians. Here, we read the story of the great beach landing that ultimately led to the end of the Third Reich.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. The Wait describes the buildup and planning needed until the decision by Dwight Eisenhower to launch the invasion. The Night covers the glider and paratrooper assault and the goals of each. The sea of confusion that comes into play when targets are missed is conveyed to the reader in such a way as to show the fear these men must have felt. The Day describes the beach assault and the horrors, and death, the soldiers faced.<br /><br />Throughout, one sees over and over again how the German high command failed to heed what in hindsight are obvious signals and warnings about the attack. Air power was moved from the coast, Rommel was headed to meet with the Fuhrer, lower level generals seemed clueless and all along, nobody believed the assault to be the real deal. From Hitler down, or perhaps because of Hitler\u2019s belief, it was assumed this was just a jab and the attempted knockout blow would be delivered elsewhere.<br /><br />Even once the full assault was underway few were willing to adjust their beliefs let alone stand up to Hitler. In fact, the Fuhrer was not even awakened to inform him of what was happening. Had the Germans been more aware the outcome of June 6, 1944 could have been different.<br /><br />This is not a \u201cwhat if\u201d book however and the Germans, with no air support and little leadership, were caught off guard. The actions of the following days, weeks, and months are not told here. This book deals only with June 6. We ultimately know the result however.<br /><br />While an easily readable book there is a major failing here and I do not know if it through Mr. Ryan or the publisher. The book is sorely in need of maps; the version of the text I read contained none. When I say maps, I mean it needs many. French geography is not my strongpoint and so I was lost in terms of where things were happening.<br /><br />Despite my concern about maps I can highly recommend this title for anybody interested in the western theatre of World War II.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Hip re-envisioning of classical mythology", "text": "Amelia (after Earhart), the self-named first-person narrator of the Children of Chaos trilogy, is a quirky, gutsy young woman who learns, early in ORPHANS OF CHAOS, that she can see into and move through dimensions beyond the three that normal folks perceive. It turns out that she and her companions are hostages against the good behavior of their parents, partisans of the Titans, the gods who in classical mythology overthrew the first generation of gods and were in turn overturned by the third generation. Virtually all of the characters can be found in references on classical mythology. For reasons not yet clear, the ages-old war between generations of gods is being fought out (at least in part) on present-day earth. The hostages yearn for freedom, and slowly recognize they can use their powers to escape their captors.<br /><br />I was initially impressed with the way Wright handled speaking in the voice of a teenage girl. I was therefore deeply disappointed when, around p. 150, it turns out that spunky and self-possessed Amelia actually longs to be dominated by men, ordered around by men, and punished by men. Wright explains her appetite for domination as a result of supernatural attack, but the sexual politics of Amelia's desires (and Wright's fixations on bondage and spanking) taint the book. I also found the constant sexual banter uncharacteristic for a group of children who grew up together in such close quarters; I would expect more caution and respect among them. If I recall correctly, Wright's sexual politics were also pretty bad in his Golden Age series. This is particularly disappointing in a lauded young writer.<br /><br />While ORPHANS OF CHAOS has many flaws, it is nevertheless enjoyable and provocative (when it's not outright offensive). I like it better so far than his Golden Age trilogy, which also drew quite a bit on classical mythology. I hesitate to recommend the book because of its backwards sexual politics and annoying sexual banter, but I can't entirely condemn it either.

There are plenty of dune lovers out there that call the Kevin and Brian Dune books \" crap \", or \" McDune books \" because Frank Herbert didn't write them. I am not one of those people. I think Kevin and Brian's work has been overall great and they have continued to breathe life into the greatest SciFi series ever. I would put Hosue Corrino, House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and Butlerian Jihad up against any of the Dune books after the original any day of the week.<br /><br />That said this book was even worse than Sisterhood of Dune (the previous book). Here are a few brief problems I had, I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum.<br /><br />- Hyla and Andros. How in the hell do you not include these characters from Sisterhood in this book? They were the 2 most compelling antagonist's in the previous book and you had them eaten by sandworms half way through Sisterhood. I expected them to come back in Mentat's but sadly they never did. This was a colossal waste and frankly, bewildering.<br /><br />- Cymeks. So we are to understand that the most brilliant businessman in the galaxy (Venport), a man fighting the rise of the Butlerian movement (anti-tech / thinking machines) seeks to turn the public view in his favor by creating and releasing new versions of Cymeks to kill humans? Really? His plan to rally humanity on his side is to resurrect the technology that enslaved them? This was not logical writing.<br /><br />- The Sisterhood. Two Books, both putting a lot of weight and writing into who the chosen successor of the Sisterhood would be and the writers decide, oh, let's just make it both Vayla and Doretta at the end. That was the best solution you could come up with? Talk about a letdown.<br /><br />- Emperor Corrino. His whole character was just hollow. House Corrino did such an amazing job on covering palace intrigue and the secrets of state that I just don't think anything  regarding the Emperor or his brother Roderick in this book was interesting at all. The authors seemed to just throw in some cruelty to make the Emperor more interesting but he was neutered the entire book and his brother Roderick while capable, just didn't have anything to do in the book.<br /><br />- The Fremen. They were pretty much nonexistent in this book and the last. It follows 1 small group of Fremen who try to take up work in the Emperium away from their Sietch. Boring, obvious, and completely pointless to the story. They clearly just threw in some Fremen at the last minute.

It does say that this book is juvenile fiction/fantasy but I think most anyone who LOVES The Wizard of Oz AND books will love this sweet little tale!<br /><br />Toto's Tale is told in the point of view of Toto. Yep that's right. The dog. He smells the storm brewing that will lift up the house and twist them and twitch them each way and land them on the wicked witch of the east. What's funny about this little book is that from a dog's point of view, going to Oz is HILARIOUS! The laughs and smiles were certainly rolling off my face when I read this book. Dorothy is his pet girl and he must protect, but then he makes some friends along the way. Some of these friends, were not in the original Wizard Of Oz but still, he makes them and the comics really start rolling then!<br /><br />Again, I say that this book is juvenile fiction/fantasy, but it's a great, sweet read for most anyone. If you have a young reader in your life, then please, grab a copy (or two or three!). This 5 star little book will be a perfect Christmas gift for them!<br /><br />*This book was provided for review by PUYB*", "images": [], "asin": "1936144611", "parent_asin": "1936144611", "user_id": "AHXTFYXUTFW7DPWTCBT27TZYGQSQ", "timestamp": 1288954693000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Thoughtful, heartfelt, and uplifting", "text": "Steven Kotler's tale of his move, with the woman he loved, from LA to the beautifully-wild but impoverished Chimayo, New Mexico, to give their rescue dogs the space they needed works on several levels: as a memoir describing a man looking for authentic meaning in his life, as the compassionately-told story of the abused, abandoned, and unwanted dogs he and his wife have worked with, and as a thought-provoking call to re-examine our relationship with not only dogs but animals in general. Kotler uses the story of his journey to explore a variety of fascinating topics from whether animals laugh to how both animal and mixed-species groups enter a state of flow to the use of hallucinogens by and homosexuality among animals. There's a great deal to be learned from this fascinating and deeply-compassionate book.<br /><br />That said, I found the story initially a bit hard to get into. Though I love dogs and have adopted many rescues over the years, the couple's initial plan seemed so doomed, it was tough for me to relate to their decision to make the move.  I was won over by the couple's courage and wisdom - and of course the dogs themselves - but there were times Kotler's intellectual meandering wandered a bit far afield, into esoterica (in the latter part of the book) that had me skimming rather than hanging onto every word as I'd done earlier in the book.<br /><br />Overall, however, I highly recommend this for anyone interested in a thought-provoking and moving exploration of the relationship between animals and humans.

{"rating": 5, "title": "So which is it -- New Deal, or raw deal?", "text": "Raw. Clearly, if the author's book were instead touting President Franklin Roosevelt's \"New Deal,\" he would have titled the book something like, \"Some Fools Say It Was a RAW Deal\"!<br /><br />Suppose FDR had actually kept his presidential campaign promises to cut spending and taxes, and eliminate the tariffs from the Smoot-Hawley Bill right away? Such were indeed his promises, but these did not happen except for small reductions in Smoot-Hawley. FDR did have some understanding about the economics behind these issues, yet he chose to go in the opposite direction. \"New Deal or Raw Deal?\" explores why. The New Deal did serve President Roosevelt well, even as the economic numbers told an opposite story for almost a decade. Simply explained, FDR discovered he could promise one thing during campaigns, then do something quite different after taking office, as long as enough constituencies got their subsidies. Fulsom notes that this happens currently.<br /><br />At the core, the author points out that the nation's founders did not intend to create a utopia. They instead created a country on exciting new principles of individualism tempered by experience, where fidelity and working by the rules counted more than good intentions. Fulsom saves his harshest talk for historians Arthur Schlessinger and William Leuchtenburg, the ones he holds most responsible for perpetuating the many myths about the New Deal. He accuses these two of giving priority to compassion over experience.<br /><br />Libertarians will likely fault Fulsom's statements about the Federal Reserve's actions before and during the Great Depression, believing that he would benefit from study into economists' work like Murray Rothbard's discussion of that important period in history. Still, as the author says, many businesses today find themselves uncertain about future taxes, regulations, and Fed monetary actions, very much like the Great Depression era. This alone is an excellent reason to get Fulsom's book.", "images": [], "asin": "1416592377", "parent_asin": "1416592377", "user_id": "AF47V2KBMY3GIYNYPPJSKZFCSG7A", "timestamp": 1290145517000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

The store is closed but the guy looks nice, he is handsome and seems genuine about it being his 1 year anniversary with his girlfriend, so she lets him in. He gets her with chloroform after she turns around to wrap up his gift.<br /><br />The story is told from the ten months after the day she was abducted when she is back at home. She was held for over seven months and she is trying to come to terms with what happened. She came back in pieces as she describes it (PTSD in psychological terms), but she refuses to talk to the psychologists she tried because of different issues, one used candles that smelled like the ones her captor \u201cthe monster\u201d used, another treated her like she was crazy.<br /><br />So Jane decides to write about her experience as a form of therapy, both her time in captivity and since she got home. So the book goes back and forth, then (from her kidnapping forward) to now (present). As Jane tries to understand everything that happened to her and work through her trauma, we as readers are finding out what happened in the order it happened and also finding out how it is affecting her now that she is at home.<br /><br />As you would expect, Jane is having trouble adjusting at home. She went through various types of physical and mental torture while in captivity, though I won\u2019t give any spoilers as to what those were but to say it wasn\u2019t a standard kidnapping. The book had my emotions going all over the place, I was feeling for Jane so much.<br /><br />I felt so bad for her when she was free but trying to recreate her own room to be more like the room in captivity. She knew it is better being free, but almost feels safer in that room where nobody can get her or talk to her. I cried throughout half of the book because it was heart wrenching.<br /><br />\u201cI run.<br />Because I can\u2019t sleep.<br />Because Memory can\u2019t catch me if I keep a fast pace.<br />Because my parents\u2019 door is closed, but Night can\u2019t shut me out.<br />Because I\u2019m not supposed to be out at this hour, especially after everything, especially all alone\u2014and so it feels a little like power.\u201d<br /><br />As Jane gets further in her story and continues to struggle with being at home, her Mother tries to get her back to normal by forcing her to go out or to see her friends. Her Mom can\u2019t heal until Jane heals, which puts more pressure on Jane. Jane struggles with her feelings for Mason who was one of the other people held captive and was able to cut a small hole in the wall so they could hold hands. Her struggles with the reasons for why \u201cthe monster\u201d took her were hardest of all.<br /><br />\u201cWhat do you feel most nervous about?\u201d<br />\u201cFacing the truth, I guess.\u201d<br />\u201cThe truth about . . .\u201d<br />\u201cWhat happened when I was taken.\u201d I study her face, trying to figure out if she knows my story, if she saw it on the news or read it in the papers.<br /><br />I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

The horror aspect of this story was deliciously creepy and was a by-product of the abuse of Vera by her parents, Francis and Daphne, and by other actions on their part. The child abuse was not easy to read, but it needed to be explored to fully explain what was happening in the story and to develop the horror aspect. Daphne's abuse was overt: cruel, critical and jealousy-driven.  Francis's abuse was more his teaching Vera the wrong things. He was a serial killer and set a vicious and violent example. He explained to Vera he was just trying to help his victims.  As a young girl, she misunderstood that \u201chelp\u201d as a positive thing. I think she would have followed in Francis\u2019s footsteps had she not been stopped by his confession to his crimes and hers. I\u2019m wondering if Frances left the peephole to the basement in Vera\u2019s bedroom on purpose. In any event, Vera's life was difficult, and she grew up wrong and confused and wanting to be loved.  She only wanted a sister or a friend who would support and help her.

{"rating": 5, "title": "\"...a journey toward...self -acceptance and perspective.\"", "text": "I loved this book, almost from its opening pages.  What function as somewhat parallel stories, related stories, \"Orphan Train\" is peopled with characters that you will come to love and care for, and, as harsh as the circumstances often are, wish for them the very best of outcomes.  Christina Baker Kline's previous book, \"A Bird In Hand,\" was a Vine selection some while ago.  I enjoyed it but I love this story so much more.  \"Orphan Train\"...there were such, and over many years they brought in excess of 200,000 homeless children of varied ages to stops along the way in the Midwest and far West, in the hopes of finding homes for them.  Didn't seem to matter whether the homes turned out to be good homes; rather it was almost an effort to remove orphans from the scene, scatter them, often without any care or concerrn as to the circumstances into which they might be taken.  \"Orphan Train\" is a beautifully realized story, moving us back and forth in time from the late 1920's Minnesota to 2011 Maine, back and forth as the pages unfold.  Most memorable, of course, will be our interaction with Niamh (later to be named Vivian) and Molly, Niamh an immigrant girl, who, through circumstances, comes to be on the orphan train, Molly a girl of the present, about to \"age out\" of foster care.  The paths of these two characters cross just when perhaps both need the other the most.  You'll be pulled into this relationship and Vivian's incredible story, perhaps finding, as I did, that the book was impossible to put down.  This is a memorable piece of writing, a lovely novel of which author Baker Kline can be so proud.  She cloaks her history lesson in a tale that will move you, sometimes anger you, but always inspire you as roads, by chance, are taken by these characters, leading them to the book's lovely conclusion.", "images": [], "asin": "0061950726", "parent_asin": "0061950726", "user_id": "AHQPHTOVRPQOZQUSFLDUBAUI3XGA", "timestamp": 1366908703000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "We Built These Cities", "text": "Today I'm looking at the City and the City by China Mieville. This is a science fiction book that came out a little over a decade ago. I want to like this author's works mainly because he's a comrade. I first read him a couple of years back when he did that version of the Russian Revolution called October. It was a historical novel that was like Ten Days that Shook the world but was better than Ten Days that Shook the World. Since then, I've read a couple of his books, This Census Taker and Three Moments of an explosion and Neither were particularly memorable.<br /><br /> This book is a New York Times bestseller and one that you go to and it's supposed to be one of his better ones. If you read the blurbs and just try to get a sense of what's that about you really might not know. The basic premise is that there are two cities that exist independently but in the same geographical space. The people who live in those cities are trained from their youth to ignore what's going on right next to him if they get the signals and the cues that it is from one of them the other City. The thing is that it just didn't really work for me. It was about page 74 and I realized that I was getting most of the World building for this aspect that I was going to get as a reader. I just said I don't believe it. Now here's the thing, everything else is good enough that despite me not believing the world building and the central premise I still want to keep reading.<br /><br />There's a murder mystery and that very Central thing plays huge role in it. What it really got me thinking was what this two-city thing really represented. Was it some geographical political commentary, which I think is a reading that is the end of the easiest to do because it seems like it's right there for analysis? There's also the possibility that isn't there a bigger metaphysical thing. I kept asking myself  are these people already dead are they in purgatory I don't know. The problem with that is there are  people that come in from outside and visit the cities. And then they leave again so that might not be the best reading. Overall, I did read it and I enjoyed it, but I just tried really had to not think about that central thing of the setting because the minute I started thinking of the central premise it didn't work so just kind of was that thing if you ignore the man behind the curtain it's okay but like that curtain just really lamp shaded.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "034549752X", "parent_asin": "034549752X", "user_id": "AEP6VSEK3Y5MHGJCG2RGHM2EHCLA", "timestamp": 1611703856834, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Mankind reached the stars in the 21st century, but at the end of this century Earth was devastated by a war between the great powers. A colony world called Sparta founded the first \"Empire of Man\" which kept the peace for five hundred years, but then as several worlds tried to break away, another series of wars broke out, the Session wars, which devastated most of the worlds of human space.<br /><br />Prince Samual's world, where the story begins, was twice bombarded from space and blasted back to a renaissance level of culture. By the time the Empire made contact again in 3013, just before this book starts, they've made it back to about the level of technology Earth had in the early 20th century. The planet Makassar, a few light years away, was even worse hit, and is struggling to maintain even a medieval level of culture and technology.<br /><br />Sparta and the Empire's home worlds also suffered, but after the war finally spluttered out around 2870 AD, the Second Empire has been proclaimed and Sparta is gradually re-establishing control of human space. They are grimly determined to make sure that nobody ever gets a chance to launch another interstellar war.<br /><br />The hero of the book is Colonel, or rather former Colonel, Nathan McKinnie, lately the commander of the best regiment in the army of the former state of Orleans - until an Imperial vessel allied to the rival nation of Haven blew his soldiers to bits. The Empire needs a world government to work through in order to annex Prince Samual's World, and the easiest way to get one is to help King David of Haven conquer the planet. What they don't realise is that King David and certain of his ministers know they are being used as puppets and are grimly determined to keep as much independence for the planet as they can.<br /><br />As a former opponent of Haven, Nathan McKinnie is astonished to get a job offer from one of the most sinister figures in King David's government. If Prince Samual's world can build a spaceship before being taken into the Empire, the planet will keep more independence and privilages. As someone says in the book, \"we can make them take us as subjects, not slaves.\" But the nearest place where they might be able to get information on how to build one is a few light years away - in an old First Empire library, on the planet Makassar, where the last remnants of even a feudal civiliation are about to be over-run by thousands of barbarians ...<br /><br />If you have enjoyed any of the \"Future History series like \"The mote in God's Eye\" or it's sequels, \"[[ASIN:0671795740 The Gripping Hand]]\" and \"[[ASIN:0615434142 Outies (Mote Series, Book 3)]],\" you will love this book.", "images": [], "asin": "0356085066", "parent_asin": "0356085066", "user_id": "AHVA3FI44KMTDRWUGAVXWKEJ5AAQ", "timestamp": 1353152269000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

A joint US-Russian covert strike against a secret lab in India destroys it - but barely misses Reznikov. Who tipped him? Who busted him out? Who\u2019s got him now? What\u2019s he up to? The US and Russia both seemed to want Reznikov, an embarrassment, forgotten.<br /><br />Berg knows the world won\u2019t be safe until Reznikov is dead.

A top secret Russian group had been dispatched to kill Sanderson - but he talks their leader into cooperating instead.<br /><br />Have both governments now decided they want Reznikov back in business?

{"rating": 5, "title": "Exceptional look at the Future of High Tech Weapons and Cyber Warfare\u2003", "text": "Ghost Fleet is a look at a future, in which China takes on the US with a combination of Cyber Warfare, modified stolen technologies from around the world, and some support from countries such as Russia.<br />Whilst I will discuss various aspects of the book, I will try not to give away any major spoilers.<br />The story was very reminiscent of a modern day \u2018Red Storm Rising\u2019, except that this time there is no resource crisis, and the US is the central battle scene.<br />The story itself is a fascinating exploration of the various strategies, technologies, weapons and methodologies that would be employed in a modern theatre of war. There is a distinct difference to how Naval and Air combat will be fought today, as opposed to how it was fought back in the previous century.<br />The addition of Cyber Warfare, hacking, information technology etc, is already having an impact on the world today, and the authors of the book show with some fascinating and terrifying clarity the impacts it will have on the 21st Century Warfighter.<br />There has been a lot of discussion over the years about China using their vast resources to \u2018hack\u2019 other world powers and \u2018steal\u2019 their technology, and either directly copy it, or reverse engineer it and make it work better or more efficiently. Ghost Fleet endeavours to capture this practice, but in a slightly more fictional manner, giving us an insight into the hacking process, as well as showing us the better engineered tech as a result.<br />The book is obviously a stimulating exploration of future technology, but the Authors have been clever and wrapped it in a creative thriller, exploring the personal lives of several main characters to give the story some depth and relay a personal aspect as well. This has also allowed them to explore not only the human impact of this future war, but also the Political situation as well as some of the more Human technologies that are available in this future.<br />The Political situation in this book is rather interesting as it looks at a very fluid future, taking into account not just the technology, but also the stock markets, resources, mining, the space race as well as the major and minor countries and their influence over the Military and Political arena.<br />This was a rather interesting (and in some aspects rather frightening) look into the future that potentially awaits us, even more so with the current selection of US Presidential Candidates. Ghost Fleet attacks from all angles to provide a comprehensive view of a technologically thrilling future in which war seems not only inevitable, but that technology will play a much bigger part in than ever before.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Hey Box, the bad guys are the WP, not the FBI", "text": "Why did I decide to tread \u201cWolf Pack\u201d (WP) by C J Box?  It\u2019s the 19th in his series on Wyoming Wild game warden Joe Pickett, I had read the first in the series and reviewed if favorably back in 2002, and hadn\u2019t read another since.  I usually read a lot of crime fiction, bios, and history and was looking for something different.  I love the West (reside on the East Coast), but in my humble opinion the pickin\u2019s are slim in terms of modern day writing talent.<br /><br />Though I rate WP a 4 on Amazon I think that\u2019s a bit inflated and I will score a 3 \u00bd on LibraryThing.  WP has a lot of very strong positives, but also some negatives that really turned me off.  So, much like the scenery of Wyoming, a lot of peaks and valleys.  Let\u2019s start with the pluses.  A lot of good description of the background with real name places, locales you can look up on Bing and Google Maps and explore yourself a bit even if you\u2019re 2000 miles away.  A very good plot.  A mysterious family has settled in the area, bringing with them a rather extraordinary level of security.  Most readers will tumble to the reason why faster than any of the good guys in WP though.  Some interesting scenes involving drones and what they can do to/for wildlife.  A very interesting cast of bad guys, very credible, horrifying.  An excellent climax, really well done.  The tension amps up very nicely throughout the second half of the book, and the extended climax is one of the few I have read that is not dragged down by a series on mini climaxes.  Sounds like 5 stars so far, even as I write this, but\u2026.<br /><br />One of the problems I have with a setting like this one can best be illustrated by some of the very popular BBC mysteries we are blessed with.  A current favorite of my household is Midsomer Murders. Great stories every week, typically 3-4 victims in every 90 minute show.  The problem is that the setting is a village somewhere or the other in England where everyone knows each other, patronizes each other\u2019s businesses, and kills each other.  If anyone were keeping a tab, I think the whole town would be gone by season 3 or so, much like Christie\u2019s \u201c10 Little Indians\u201d, perhaps redone as \u201c200 Little Brits\u201d.  Ok, so you have to suspend reality a bit, I get that, but still.  Secondly, I\u2019m not crazy about Joe, he sorta comes in a plain vanilla wrapper, but when you open the package, what\u2019s inside is plain vanilla.  Joe seems best in this story at just keeping out of the way.  Sorry, but I prefer heroes.  My third and last knock is a bit political, and upfront I must say I have no idea of the author\u2019s politics nor his intent here, I can only comment on my reaction.  There are two FBI characters  (and later a third but to a lesser degree) in WP that are over the top.  Obnoxious, pushy, bullying, lying, intimidating, entrapping, non-cooperative, unprincipled, and ten more such adjectives.  I understand that polls will tell you that many US citizens have that perception of the FBI, particularly in red states.  There is a bit of a defense of the two characters approach offered by others but its lame.  I am sure there are some that would suggest the author might be pandering to his audience, or in his defense is only re-emphasizing locals\u2019 views of Federal Government in general.  My bottomline is that I thought it was a poor decision to do this now,  given all the internal attacks on our intelligence services over the past two years.", "images": [], "asin": "B07FLZYJD8", "parent_asin": "B07FLZYJD8", "user_id": "AG7BOX7LSHKRG37TUNSUWXNYY6EQ", "timestamp": 1559913750270, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Still good, although the fictional parts are perhaps less believable", "text": "First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 31st May<br /><br />I very much liked the previous novel about King Edwin, Oswald\u2019s predecessor and nephew, by the same author. This one picks up and continues the story but with Oswald as the main character. As has been mentioned a number of times by many, little is known about the historical character of Oswald, but he has been a major source of inspiration, starting with Tolkien, and this book\u2019s subtitle (Return of the King) hints at.<br /><br />There is much to commend in this book, but also some things that did not work well for me.<br /><br />Among the positive elements are the influence on Oswald and the political role played by the monastery of Iona, and its abbot S\u00e9g\u00e9ne (a historical character) who do seem to have supported the Northumbrian\u2019s bid for the throne with a contingent of armed monks and his fight against Cadwallon, despite the latter being a Celt. His reward was to replace the Roman Church with the Celtic one. The monk Aidan, who does seem to have Oswald\u2019s friend, did become bishop and founded Lindinsfarne with the King\u2019s support.<br /><br />The political relations between the various kingdoms are just as well-presented as they were in the previous volume on Edwin, whether these were Celtic, Angles or Saxons. Of particular interest is the attitude of the Briton King of Rheged. While the personality of this king might be fictional, his behaviour - he was ready to side against Cadwallon King of Gwynedd in order maintain his own independence and prevent the Welsh king from becoming too powerful although both were Britons \u2013 seems to have been fairly typical of the period and shared among most Kings, irrespective of their origins.<br /><br />On a different note, the description of the ex-Roman fortress of Carlisle, the seat of the King of Rheged\u2019s power, is well-done and particularly interesting, just as that of the derelict fortifications of Hadrian\u2019s Wall near which Oswald fought his decisive battle against Cadwallon.<br /><br />Another particularly good feature, which could perhaps have been developed even more, is to show to what extent Oswald relied on his younger brother (and future successor) Oswiu and how the two \u201cshared the work\u201d between them. This is probably one of the main reasons that allowed the Northumbrians lead by Oswiu to conquer Goddodin and take the fortress of Edinburgh while Oswald was holding Northumbria together. It is also this \u201cdivision of labour\u201d that allowed them to repel Penda\u2019s attack on East Anglia without fear of being attacked in turn on another front by one of the other kings.<br /><br />Another good set of features are the inclusions of glossary, map, list of the main characters, a note on pronunciation and a few pages summarising the main events of Edwin\u2019s reign. I found these features particularly helpful to follow the intrigue and complex relationships and marriage alliances between the various kingdoms and pretenders to the various crowns. The little summary of the previous book is particularly helpful for anyone reading this one without the benefit of having read the first title. This allows Oswald to be read as a stand-alone book, as opposed to most series.<br /><br />I liked this book, found it an exciting read, and could not put it down. I did however have three problems the author\u2019s fictional choices. One was that I found some of them hard to believe or even bordering on the caricature. While I will refrain from elaborating too much in order to avoid spoilers, I got the impression at times that the book was about Oswald the dutiful Saint, Cadwallon the delusional, and Penda the treacherous.<br /><br />Cadwallon\u2019s portrait was particularly difficult to believe. While Cadwallon does seem to have tried to portray himself as the returning Arthur and this may have turned out to be a political blunder because it alienated other British Kings, he is shown in this book as whining, delusional and even cowardly, rather than the crafty and powerful ruler that he probably was and who over-reached, with his last gamble goinf badly wrong.<br /><br />Another point is that there is nothing to confirm Oswald\u2019s inner desire to retire from the world and become a monk, or his ascetic behaviour. There were quite a few other reasons than these for making him into a Saint shortly after his death, including his care for the poor and destitute, which seems to have been genuine. The supposed tension between Oswald and his younger brother, and the source of this tension, also seem to have been invited by the author while this is the first time I have ever heard of Penda having also a brother.<br /><br />While what happened to Oswald\u2019s body is drawn from the sources, his death may not have been caused by the elaborate and somewhat complicated plot contained in the book. A much simpler explanation was that Oswald and his followers were on a raiding expedition and got caught far from their base. Cornered and badly outnumbered, they were destroyed, which is something that happened quite frequently given the kind of warfare that was taking place at the time.<br /><br />Finally, there is again the question of numbers on each side when describing the various battles between the military households of the various warlords. Here again, the author has chosen a minimalist approach with \u201carmies\u201d in the very low hundreds at most, or even less than a hundred. While there is no way to be sure whether this is exaggerated or not, I cannot help thinking that it would be somewhat difficult to form a shield wall with only eighty warriors. Here again, however, as with the author\u2019s characterisation, this is about perceptions and personal preferences more than anything else so that I will rate this book four stars, despite slightly preferring the first volume.<br /><br />Again, for those wanting to check historical elements or learn more about Oswald on the one hand and warfare during these times on the other, I can recommend Max Adams\u2019 \u201cKing of the North\u201d, which is about much more than Oswald and also covers the reign of his uncle Edwin and Guy Halsall\u2019s \u201cWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West (450-900).", "images": [], "asin": "B010Q6E0BC", "parent_asin": "B010Q6E0BC", "user_id": "AGAYTQENQ4WNDQK6CHIVWTCP4PNQ", "timestamp": 1438420339000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent Overview of Christian Church History", "text": "For anyone looking for a history of how the catholic church came to be and splintered into the many denominations that now represent organized Christianity, this is a very good place to start.<br />Bruce Shelley has told the story of the Church's founding, growth, splits, doctrinal disputes, theological development and major personalities in a well organized and interesting way.  While some interesting aspects of church history may strike the reader as covered briefly, this is necessary to discuss all the major facets of a 2,000 year old institution.

From reading the text, I could not discern whether the author is a Catholic or Protestant -- he does a good job of describing their histories and conflicts without taking sides.<br />It is all here.  The early church story is described well -- a period that I have found give short shrift in other histories of the church.  The growth of the church from a spiritual movement of the outback of the Roman empire to state religion and preeminent institution is a fascinating story that is told well and succinctly.  The growth of the nation state and the resulting conflict with Christendom and the Reformation and organized religion's struggle with modernity round out the second half of the book.  Finally, the book describes current Christianity -- it's growth as a world movement in Africa and South America and some of the very recent aspects of Church Christianity in America (tele-evangelism, Billy Graham, secularization, etc.) end the book.<br />This book is a fascinating overview of Church History -- &quot;In Plain Language&quot; as advertised.", "images": [], "asin": "0849938619", "parent_asin": "0849938619", "user_id": "AF4A5EX4BKGDBE2IJJ2DGZOKCDQA", "timestamp": 1045584598000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "A time to be born, a time to die", "text": "Sally Nicholls is not a household name here in America.  She is possibly not even a name that most children's librarians, booksellers, and teachers would recognize right off the bat.  This, in spite of the fact that her previous book \"[[ASIN:0545069491 Ways To Live Forever]]\" was a stunning success.  Folks became quite fond of that story about a boy with a terminal disease, and I suppose they expected Ms. Nicholls to do more of the same.  That's the trouble with starting off your career with realism.  Move into fantasy and you'll find that the fantasy fans don't really know who you are and the realism fans are disgusted that you haven't produced more of the same.  Separate \"Season of Secrets\" from its predecessor, however, and what you have is a hearty little novel about a girl learning about the cruel war between the seasons, in the midst of her family's own personal tribulations.<br /><br />Since Molly and Hannah's mother died they've been handling it as best they could.  Their father, however, has not been handling it well.  Not a jot.  So distraught is he by the loss of his wife, in fact, that he sends his two daughters off to live with their grandparents in the country.  One night Molly is witness to a frightening vision of a man run down by a pack of dogs and a horned man on a horse.  In the ensuing days she tries to tell others, to no avail, then discovers the man in a nearby shed.  She cannot nurse or help him, but she can learn as much as she can about him and what exactly he is.  As she does, her father is drawn more and more into her life with her sister, though it takes him many tries and many mistakes before any progress can be made.  The return of her father and the eventual destruction of the man come together in such a way as to give rise to winter, and the ensuing, beautiful, spring.<br /><br />I've been reading so many books lately that don't give a fig for beautiful language.  Coming across Ms. Nicholls felt like a gulp of cool water then.  I wasn't two pages in when Molly let loose with the descriptive, \"Hannah is one and half years older than me, yet she takes up about one and a half million times more space.\"  And later, \"My dad's shirts are always stiff and clean and white; you button him up all the way to his throat and there he is, locked up safe and going nowhere.\"  I love a book that gives everyday descriptions real personality and flair.  It's the signature style of Ms. Nicholls.  It's something you can count on in every book she writes.<br /><br />And then there was an element to this title that I found simultaneously clever and frustrating.  Age.  Here we have a tale of two sisters, one older, one younger, and there's not a moment in this story when we've a clear sense of how old they are.  This is frustrating to a reviewer like myself since you judge how believable you find a character based, in large part, on whether or not they accurately act their age.  I would have thought that Molly was acting a bit young for her age at quite a few points in the story, except that for all I know Molly could be seven or she could be ten.  My suspicion is that Ms. Nicholls gave Molly a younger age, but then realized something.  If you write a middle grade novel for 9-12 year-olds and you make your heroine only eight years of age, children aren't going to want to read that story.  Truth be told, kids like to read about children that are older than themselves.  I don't care how many horned baddies you throw in there, the minute they realize that they're sympathizing with someone the age of their little brother or sister, they may abandon the novel tout suite.  The solution then would be to eliminate ages altogether.  A clever solution then, if a bit frustrating for those of us trying to get a firm grasp on whom these characters really are.<br /><br />It's such a strange novel that for a moment there you just have to wonder if this is all entirely in Molly's head.  She certainly believes that the man and the Holly King (a.k.a. the dude with the horns) are real, but might we take this book as a story that is just the wild fever dream of a girl desperately trying to recreate a strong male figure in the absence of her own father?  You can get fairly far in with this interpretation, but at some point it's just not possible anymore.  What happens here is real, to a certain extent.  For good or for ill.<br /><br />I've always had a bit of interest in books for children that are brave enough to meld religions in some fashion.  For example, there's \"[[ASIN:1416949658 The Dark Is Rising]]\" with its fingers on pagan traditions and a nod to modern Christianity (a small nod).  Better still was Pat Walsh's \"[[ASIN:0545229227 The Crowfield Curse]]\" which managed to work in Christianity, the older fairy worship of the hills, and the even older dark religions that came before.  \"Season of Secrets\" for its part is nothing so dark, but at the same time it isn't afraid to lead its child readers to the edge of some pretty huge questions.  The Man, as he is sometimes known, is a figure of rebirth in the spring.  So it is that Nicholls will have Molly first encounter his likeness in a church (an accurate detail, I have little doubt) and then later say things like, \"He looks like a curly haired Jesus\" later even speculating (but not questioning) that, \"he's sort of god, like Jesus.\" Nicholls also draws together different old English myths with skill, reminding readers that they may have seen the horned leader of The Wild Hunt not only in books like \"[[ASIN:080508049X The Black Cauldron]]\" or the aforementioned \"The Dark is Rising\" but also in stories about Woden, Odin, Herne, and even King Arthur.<br /><br />But the book that this reminded me the most of, both in terms of tone and subject matter, was David Almond's \"[[ASIN:038532653X Skellig]]\".  In one book you've a girl who tends to an injured man with the power over nature in an abandoned shed.  In the other a boy who tends to a starving man with wings in his garage.  Of course the relationship in \"Skellig\" is mildly contentious.  \"Season of Secrets\", in contrast, feels as if it is invoking the relationship between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus in \"[[ASIN:0006716873 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]\".  Not a bad comparison when you consider that in both cases you have wild nature spirits tamed, in a sense, by little British girls.  Much of this story has been seen before in some sense, but Nicholls puts her own very unique spin on the storytelling.  The result is a powerful look at love, nature, the seasons, family, and home.<br /><br />For ages 9-12.", "images": [], "asin": "054521825X", "parent_asin": "054521825X", "user_id": "AHF2B6SMLWPQ4RW7FFSHZ6YJBSCA", "timestamp": 1296524269000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

The only issue is that there is an unevenness to each of the stories in terms of quality of the art and the research that went into the story. For example, there is an example where the cartoonist is showing the Panama Canal (P. 11) - in a story that takes place prior to the digging of the canal. Little things like that in a book about history make you wonder what is wrong about what you don\u2019t know.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Not one boring sentence and the action never stops.  Great!", "text": "I love true stories about adventures in faraway places.  And this fine book certainly meets that test.  Kelly James gives us a short introductory chapter in which she describes her upbringing on a ranch in the American northwest.  She was raised to ride and shoot and live with adventure.  Soon, she realized she didn't want to be relegated to a typical female role in life.  And so she became a private investigator and has traveled all over the world in a wide variety of international business investigations.  Mostly, she works in Africa and the book is comprised of four separate stories about a few unique assignments.<br /><br />Her writing style is fast-paced, breezy and has the sense of adventure that obviously drives her life.  There's not one boring sentence in the whole book and the action never stops.  I read these stories with the kind of attention that kept me breathless and turning the pages as something new happens on every page.  And my sense of wonder at her bravery and willingness to take risks never ceased.  I just couldn't stop reading  and was sorry when this 235-page book ended.<br /><br />In the first story she investigates a mysterious death of a wealthy plantation owner.  In the second story she travels into the depths of gorilla country.  In the third story she helps a young man visit his war-torn land.  And, in the last story, she is hired to investigate a young female African doctor's disappearance.  Often, she fines herself in  personal danger and has is forced to survive in a very hostile environment.  Each one of these stories kept my eyes glued to the page.  I couldn't put the book down until they were finished.<br /><br />\"Dancing With the Witchdoctor\" was a mini-adventure for me.  It brought me to places I've only dreamed of visiting and made me identify with the author's courage, stamina and sense of adventure.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Low Calorie Diet In Disguise", "text": "Dr. Sears's theories on different types of food and how they are processed by the body are interesting, but misguided.  Actually, people lose weight on this diet because they end up cutting calories like crazy, even past what can be considered a sane amount.  Also, there are a lot of psychological factors at play here, especially Dr. Sears's marketing skills, which are excellent.  This is one big infomercial.  I would be concerned about the long term effects of so much protein and the strain placed upon the kidneys in dealing with it.  IMHO, mindset is everything.  If you believe you will feel better, exercise more and lose weight, you will because you believe that you will.  It is not for nothing that bread is known as \"The staff of life\", and a mainstay of the human race from time immemorial.  I wonder how Dr. Sears would explain my weight loss of 15 pounds in less then 4 weeks when we were very poor and subsisting mainly on pasta and canned sauce because it was a lot of food for little money.  Ditto rice.  Throughout all this, I exercised religiously and the weight dropped off.  BTW, his insinuation about the Chinese (and Japanese) having high rates of heart attacks due to high rice consumption is ridiculous.  These two people had extremely low heart disease, body fat and breast cancer etc. for centuries subsisting on a LOT of rice, fish and vegetables.  They now have the same or higher rates of heart disease as Americans because unfortunately they have adopted the American high fat diet.  This has been proven by following Orientals who move to the US and give up their traditional diets.  Their rates of heart disease, breast cancer and diabetes soared.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Relive the goosebumps", "text": "If you want a good reminder of Barack Obama's inauguration, this handsome hardcover is it. It brings back all the goosebump moments. It's the result of the Washington Post's exhaustive coverage of the event, which employed over 100 photographers and reporters.<br /><br />It makes a nice bookend with the new New York Times book [[ASIN:1594488932 Obama: The Historic Journey]] as well as, of course, [[ASIN:B001J8ULZ6 The Audacity of Hope]].<br /><br />Big and beautiful enough to be a coffee table book, The Inauguration of Barack Obama is more than a collection of photos. Also included is a stirring foreword by Washington Post Editor-at-Large Ben Bradlee, who recalls the first inauguration he attended, of John F. Kennedy, and writes: \"This shift of power is orderly, but it's always exciting. It's the essence of democracy.\" Though the coverage of it isn't as thorough as in the Times book, Obama's story is detailed, too, from childhood through young adulthood -- when he, in his own words, burned inwardly with a \"knotted, howling assertion of self\" -- through his marriage and family life. At the back of the book is the full text of the Inaugural Address.<br /><br />I like the variety of photos. One spread shows the thousands gathered for the ceremony itself, another simply Obama's hand encircling his wife's waist on the Day of Service. A sober tribute from Obama and Biden at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery is followed by a sweet portrait of Biden holding his young grandson. My favorites are the more candid, silly shots: First lady Michelle Obama getting her gown stepped on by her husband while dancing; daughter Sasha playfully holding her hand in front of her sister Malia's camera, ruining her photo; bundled-up fans at 4 a.m. on the National Mall looking like mummies in their sleeping bags.<br /><br />The presidential seal on the dust jacket is embossed into the glossy paper.

{"rating": 3, "title": "fast-moving plot, more thriller than cozy", "text": "A mystery in which the sleuth is a professional geologist--and a woman at that--is certainly unusual.  Lee Mims' first mystery features Cleo Cooper as a geologist who has lined up a lucrative drilling operation on a rural property owned by Gladys Walton.  Much of the story involves two of Gladys's conniving family members (her grown children) who attempt to take advantage of her good luck and Cleo's in having found granite on Gladys's property.  The story is mainly about Cleo and her quest to get through the legal and ethical obligations of drilling for granite.  For the reader, it offers an introduction to the danger and difficulties that such a project entails.  Ms. Mims writes well, and the plot moves along quickly.  The opening episode with the rattlesnake (also depicted on the cover of the book) is gripping, and it offers a hint that there will very likely be more elements of a thriller to come.<br /><br />Despite the positive features mentioned above, I had a rather middling response to this book.  For me, it lies somewhere between a cozy and a thriller, but from the synopsis on the back cover, I had expected a cozy.  There are no endorsements from other authors on the cover, which can offer a hint about the genre, and it took me a while to confirm that this is not a cozy.  There is excessive gore, crude language, and sex throughout, none of which in my opinion adds much at all to the story or characterization.  For readers who may be deciding whether to give this new author a try, I would say that if you like the mysteries of J. A. Jance (and I do like them myself), there's a good chance that you will like this one too. Jance's characters have more depth though; Mims doesn't give us any insight into the psychological side of Cleo Cooper's motivation.", "images": [], "asin": "0738734233", "parent_asin": "0738734233", "user_id": "AFH7WM5TULLDJQMUD6NJFSVVUBAQ", "timestamp": 1369221058000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Sustainable Ecosystems and Fire", "text": "Contrary to Smokey T. Bear, fire is an integral part of healthy ecosystems. The biggest problem with wildland fire is suppression, not burning. After a century of aggressive fire suppression and the myth of Smokey T. Bear, we now see clearly that fire is integral just as soils, sun, wind, water, insects, snow, ice and other natural processes. Put an increment borerer into a tree and you can read the fire history of an ecosystem back up to 3,000 years.<br /><br />Core into soils, meadows and adjacent streams and you can often retrace almost 10,000 years of fire history in the sediments, buried logs and stumps. Learn the behavior of wildland fire in the presence of sun, upslope wind, rain, snow, clouds, humidity, katabtic winds and air temperature and you begin to catch a glimpse of how we have artificially imposed politics, wishful thinking and pseudoscience on wildland ecosystems.<br /><br />Media and politicians speak of \"catastrophic\" and \"charred\" ecosystems, but fail to speak of the catastrophe of sprawling urban development imposed upon fire-maintained vegetation and soils. We live in wood houses with wood shake roofs and wonder why our houses burn when the surrounding air super heats.<br /><br />We have made many mistakes with fire. The first mistake is labeling wildland ecosystems uninhabited \"wilderness\". As Kat Andersen reminds us in \"Before The Wilderness,\" this was never wilderness, people have always lived here AND used fire as a tool to maintain healthy ecosystems for more than 10,000 years.<br /><br />It was the European invasion that labeled fire as \"bad\" and Disney and Bambi who drove the message home. It is only through the dedicated work of scientists and wildland managers in places like Sequoia-Kings Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone Natl Parks since 1970 that we have begun to understand the basic role of fire. The Leopold Commission in the early 1950s clearly identified the potential for large fires from all the biomass that was and continues to build up.<br /><br />There is still a large residue who label fire as \"bad,\" and don't understand the role of fire in healthy, resilant, durable ecosystems.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Impossible to categorize --or to put down", "text": "What makes you decide to read a book? It does not matter that the book was inspired by Louise Brooks but that could be intriguing enough for a start.  It is encouraging when someone like Borges- the fantasist - recommends it.  Comparisons to Philip K.Dick or Chesterton are handy, perhaps, as a hint. You may wonder how all of these very different references fit in this slim book.  But finally, when you do read it, all those references have to fall away (but perhaps not too far away) and the book must stand on its own.  Bioy Casares has created a surprising little marvel.<br /><br />Our hero is escaping the police for an unnamed capital crime, and finds himself on an island (a map is provided) decorated with three pristine buildings on the hill, but otherwise a barely hospitable place of vicious high tides, mosquitoes, swamps, reeds and misery.  As you work through this environment, Borges does come to mind, as it seems fantastic, with the imagery that seems a signature of South America genius.  You'll find yourself trying to determine whether what he describes is real or his own imaginings. After exploring every cranny of the buildings --and the descriptions remind me of art deco drawings, clean, clear, balanced but at the same time ornate-- he finds one day that the island is suddenly inhabited.  Not wanting to be discovered, he skulks around the visitors, drawn especially to the pensive and lovely Faustine and the book slips from Borges to a period mystery, a la Chesterton.  His understanding of the situation increases and it becomes more like a science fiction invention (the reference to Philip K Dick)... but still there is more, and when you realize there IS more, it becomes Casares' own novel, and stands on its own.<br /><br />It becomes a meditation on the nature of reality and our inability to separate the appearance from the nature of what is observed, the thin border between our own projections and fact, and even our willingness to consciously live in delusion. Does our hero become insane or is the answer to the mystery the whole answer, and his solution rational?<br /><br />This is a very short book, with twice the atmosphere.  It is intriguing even while it feels like it is of its own time (1925 or so). When you finish it (in a day perhaps) you may want to read it again to take the time to notice how Casares has molded so many elements into a coherent story, building dread, curiosity and solutions incredibly cleverly.

{"rating": 4, "title": "The first detective novel", "text": "THE MOONSTONE opens with the theft of a fabulous jewel from an idol in India. From this exotic location the action then goes forward in time many years to the English countryside.  The jewel, the Moonstone, has become a family heirloom soon to be presented to a young woman as a birthday present.  That very evening the Moonstone disappeared leaving behind suspicion and tragedy.  A professional detective is called in but before all is revealed there will be deaths and long hidden secrets brought to light.<br /><br />The story was originally published in the mid 1800's which can cause a problem for a modern reader.  The style of writing is much more verbose than contemporary readers are accustomed to, the vocabulary is often unfamiliar but perhaps most difficult for the modern reader are the conventions of mid Victorian society.  The class distinctions and the restrictions placed on women, particularly young, unmarried women are completely foreign to the 21st century.<br /><br />Despite these challenges THE MOONSTONE is an excellent story on its own merits.  The characters are interesting and believeable.  The plot is well thought out, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing until the very end.  For fans of detective fiction it is interesting to see the various elements of this story and recognize them from their more modern forms.<br /><br />THE MOONSTONE has been called the first detective novel.  It introduced many of the characteristics familiar to fans of this genre, the outsider, professional detective, the bumbling, incompetant local police, the clueless sidekick, the red herring clues that lead the reader astray and the premise that all clues must be available for the reader to solve the crime.

Fragile helps puts things in perspective. I enjoyed reading Fragile. It warmed my heart. Sometimes you just need to read about some great people finding each other.<br /><br />Not that Fragile is all happy-go-lucky. Not at all. The main character, Miracle, is so giving and kind.

But she has serious kidney issues. This hit home with me. My grandpa has kidney problems and he has been on dialysis for years. I know how tough it is watching someone you love go through that. The saddest part, was that even though she was always fighting for other people; fighting to see the good, fighting to spread her warmth, she didn't fight too much for herself. She seemed resigned to her sickness and it just made my heart break for her.<br /><br />But even thought Miracle didn't fight for herself, Hardy continuously fought for her.

As for FROM A LOW AND QUIET SEA (2018), ditto. With its first three sections of fifty pages each, it seems almost like he's given us three very separate, gem-like novellas. The first presents Farouk, a British-educated doctor, who flees with his wife and small daughter from the war in Syria to the West. The second centers on Lampy, a twenty-ish young man, jilted by his lover, who lives with his unmarried mother and grandfather and is stuck in a loveless affair and a dead-end job at a local old folks home. The third concerns John, much older, reflecting back on his unscrupulous ways as a successful \"lobbyist\" and how he learned early on the advantage of a well-placed lie. All three stories are set in and around Limerick (a city Ryan knows well, as he teaches at the University there).<br /><br />These three seemingly disparate lives all come together in the most moving and unexpected ways in the closing chapters, as Ryan works his usual magic, employing an unerring understanding of human nature. Did I say I loved this book? Well I did, and I do. Donal Ryan is destined to become a national treasure of Ireland.

This story is about feelings, and how emotions can both heal and destroy. So they meet, look cute together, play cryptic games...Happily ever after, nice and easy, you think?  Well, hell, no, with the emphasis on hell.  A flowing, graceful writing style draws you in...but then ties you in knots.  What's hard to comprehend --  the understated horror depicted so rationally  right before your eyes. Life's no party for either Josh or Heather, yet, in the end, they are part and parcel of each other, and damn, you feel for them.  You want them to take it and run with it, off into the sunset.  Surely, they deserve happiness. The ironic twist, turning the tables on the vicious treachery that linked them, winds up being their link to love, making you want to cheer and cry at once. And so the healing begins amid despair.  With the cruel truth outed, there can be no doubt...that a unified future is theirs.  Nothing heartless here, except  the way Heather leaves Josh in the lurch, when he reveals his own horrific secret. Just her own pain taking the reins, and it literally drives him off a cliff.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Thoroughly Enjoyable", "text": "A friend of mine began telling me about this book months ago -- he said it was funny, entertaining, cleverly written and that it completely changed his perception of perfume (in this review, by the way, I'm using the words \"perfume,\" \"cologne\" and \"scent\" interchangeably.) In fact, after reading this book, my friend went online and purchased several of the five-star perfumes so that he could smell them (and wear them) himself.<br /><br />\"What could be so fascinating about perfume?\" I wondered, so I got a copy of the book myself. I began casually flipping through it at first, looking up old favorite and the two fragrances I currently own (gifts from friends). An hour passed. And then another. I couldn't put the book down! When I finally did close the pages, I went to my tiny collection of cologne, put on a bit of my favorite (Gucci pour Homme), and enjoyed the fragrance with completely new appreciation. Turin described it as a \"liturgical frangrance\" and I realized it was a pitch-perfect description -- smoky and incense-like. I could practically see the thurifer swinging the thurible (okay, so I exaggerate, but you gotta love that liturgical-speak).<br /><br />I can see why the reviews for this book are mixed -- I suppose perfume is like anything else, personal taste varies wildly from person to person. I haven't yet found a personal favorite of mine that hasn't been favorably reviewed in this book, but I wouldn't take it personally if I loved a cologne and the authors hated it. I'm also impressed by the fact that some of the most favorably reviewed perfumes are among the least expensive brands.<br /><br />This book laid to rest some of my own questions about the colognes I'd like to buy: Does perfume expire? Is it always gender-specific? How should it be stored?<br /><br />I have one mild quibble with the book -- the authors compare other, lesser, scents to Baldessarini by Hugo Boss no less than three times. Eager to read about this apparently wonderful scent (after all, they think so highly of it that they use is as the basis of comparison) I pored through the book looking for that review. It's not reviewed!! I kept thinking I was missing it, but alas, I can only infer from their secondhand praise that this is a scent worth checking out. C'mon, don't tease me, review Baldessarini already!<br /><br />All in all, I've really learned a lot from this book, and truly enjoy the writing style.

{"rating": 4, "title": "I would recommend this book, but I would urge readers to keep an open mind and go into like I did- with very low expectations.", "text": "Three and a half stars.<br /><br />I preordered this book long before it came out. When there were issues with shipping from Amazon, I began hearing all of the backlash so I cancelled my order and requested it from the library instead. Because I had time to hear so much backlash and such, my expectations going into this were extremely low. Still, before I started reading, I made sure to get in the right mindset- totally open mind, not expecting much, etc.<br /><br />Obviously, there were some issues.<br /><br />It most definitely felt like a fan fiction more than a piece of work from J.K. Rowling. From time to time, I also felt that there were just so many things that were overlooked that this seemed almost like a rough draft, like it was very rushed. So I had issues with flow and the things just didn\u2019t line up with the original series... They were all things that Rowling should have caught and fixed...Examples:<br /><br />Using magic on Platform 9 3/4 in his third year- did they lower the age of magic outside of school grounds? Or does the platform count as school grounds?<br /><br />Suddenly having Polyjuice potion available rather than taking the month to brew- Was that a mistake? Did potions improve so it was available faster? Why wasn\u2019t that explained if so?<br /><br />How they were in the library and then seemed to go straight to the girls bathroom, but suddenly Albus has Gillyweed\u2026they must have made an off-stage stop. And Albus didn\u2019t tell Scorpius what he was getting..?<br /><br />Also, some of the dialogue wording seemed a little off, like there were words missing in some sentences.<br /><br />There were also a handful of weird things that didn't line up with the characters. Like how simply Hermione hid an item that she knew was very dangerous in the wrong hands (she's brilliant, shouldn't she have hidden it better?!) I also really didn't like how Ron was portrayed the majority of the time... Sometimes he was good old goofy Ron, but others he seemed like too much of a doofus.<br /><br />I also don\u2019t understand the Part 1 and Part 2\u2026was this play seen on two different days? The break between Part 1 and Part 2 doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026unless that marked the intermission of the play? But why title the book that way as well?<br /><br />I straight up HATE that it is being called \u201cHarry Potter Eight\u201d \u201cThe Eighth Story\u201d. Why couldn\u2019t it just be a one off? Why did it have to be merged with the series? It\u2019s not the same. If this was an actual novel that was fully written, I could see it being called book eight\u2026but no. It\u2019s a play and it was written by different people. It really seemed like Rowling only provided a weak outline.<br /><br />All that said\u2026.I tried to take this as it was and not think to much about it. So overall, I actually really enjoyed this play! I believe that if I had read this when it first came out, my thoughts would have been a bit different. But I thought it was exciting, I enjoyed the characters (LOVED SCORPIUS!) , and I could really see the play coming to life. I wish I could have seen this preformed in London!", "images": [], "asin": "1338099132", "parent_asin": "1338099132", "user_id": "AHPJFSRMWDXQ6UKYAR4SZERD2JQA", "timestamp": 1476369098000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "I didn't want to put it down", "text": "The first book in the Daughters of Boston series. Faith O'Connor fell in love with Collin McGuire as a young girl. Collin is a bold, brash rogue who lacks Faith's devout faith in God. When Collin begins secretly courting Faith's younger sister, Charity, she isn't sure her heart can handle it. After circumstances bring them together a couple of times, Collin begins to realize he has feelings for Faith as well.<br /><br />When America joins World War 1, Collin is sent to battle along with Faith's father Patrick and her brother Sean. Her mother returns to Ireland with the rest of her children to wait out the war. In Ireland, Faith meets Mitch and, thinking that Collin is lost to her forever, lets herself fall in love. When Charity's conniving nature comes between Faith and Mitch, Faith returns to America.<br /><br />I enjoyed this terrific book about family, loyalty and love. Julie Lessman has crafted a delightful story about real people: Christians who are human and struggle with the human desires of passion and anger and hate. Faith is determined to keep herself pure and worthy of a strong God-blessed marriage like her parents have. She struggles against her attraction to Collin, especially when Collin takes advantage of some solitary situations, and Faith must fight her passions.<br /><br />A bit long, the story covers a lot of ground in Boston as well as in Ireland. The tension was such that you really don't know who is going to win Faith's heart until the very end. I liked Faith, I liked Collin. I loved her parents, Marcy and Patrick. I hated Charity and given that the second book in the series is about Charity, I hope she redeems herself.<br /><br />There is preaching as well as multiple scripture references, which are understandable, given the subject matter.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Don't Judge This Book by its Movie", "text": "Most readers have heard by now that Fifteen-year-old Christopher Paolini began writing Eragon in a notebook while sitting on the couch.  His youth can be seen in his writing, his plot is at times clich\u00e9d and often formulaic.  However, having said that, I enjoyed the novel.  The setting Paolini creates is comprehensive, with detailed back-story, geography and laws that rule his imaginary world.  (Yes, some of these laws are borrowed from other authors.)  The characters of this world, in comparison to the movie are much fuller and more developed.  Paolini has stated that he carefully plotted the story and I did find it formulaic but also classic.<br /><br />Like any author he has read and was clearly influenced by other fantasy and science fiction authors.  Others have criticized Paolini for incorporating ideas from other authors into his work.  I would agree that he obviously does this and, from a more mature author, I would expect more subtlety.  He is open about many of the authors that have influenced him and lists some on his website.<br /><br />Eragon is not fantasy in the class of The Lord of the Rings or The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe but I asked myself, would I have enjoyed this book if I had known nothing about the author?  My answer is yes.  For me his youth only adds to the enjoyment I receive from his work.  To have created a fine story while only a teenager makes me wonder what he will achieve in twenty years.<br /><br />As I suggested earlier, I did not find the movie enjoyable but Eragon, the book, is an excellent first novel by a fine new author.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Interesting", "text": "To be frank, this book was an impulsive purchase. I saw it at the bookstore some years ago, and bought it after scanning briefly through it. Of course, like most impulsive book purchases, it wound up sitting on my shelf until last week. Buckley makes a strong showing in this book as a political satirist, however his ability to craft a story has something to be desired. He was able to capture my attention for hours at a time with this book, but the I found myself dragging my feet through the last fifty pages or so: I kept asking myself if something was going to happen of any particular significance. While Buckely himself is a mediocre writer, his jokes and usage of intertextuality makes him interesting to read.<br />The premise of this book is interesting enough, and gives Buckley an excellent jumping-off point to plunge the reader into a hilarious rendition of Alien abductees who finally have their day in the sun. The national issue of UFOs and alien contact is brought to the forefront of US media after a prominant televisoin host, Jack Banion, is abducted twice by a top-secret US Government collective, Majestic 12. It is clear that Buckley did his research; he intertwines this story with many references to various conspiracy theories.<br />Banion, the protagonist, finds himself falling from grace - he is no longer on Washington DC's A-list. Rather, he becomes the champion of UFO wackos, people who come in throngs claiming to have been abducted. While the story line continues upon a predicatble path, the ending had something to be desired. Additionally, for such an excellent premise, Buckley really fails to do anything phenomenal with it.<br />That being said, \"Little Green Men\" is not without its merits. While it was initially difficult to get into, after the first two-dozen pages I found myself smirking and, yes, even laughing aloud to what was said by Buckley. His political commentary falls middle-of-the-road, and while he does dish out a few low-brown sex jokes (probably pandering to the \"People\" magazine crowd), his humor does have some fine points. His continual parodies of government officials as bumbling fools become tiresome (if not already cliche before opening the book itself), but overall a worthy effort.", "images": [], "asin": "0060955570", "parent_asin": "0060955570", "user_id": "AFSXURUPP7MZOAJUJPPQBJBXX45A", "timestamp": 1077761971000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Perhaps half its power lies in the fact that we\u2019re all, in one sense or another, searching for identity.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent \"how-to\" introduction to digital scrapbooking", "text": "I've become increasingly drawn to digital scrapbooking. Traditional scrapbooking is cool, but I don't want to get heavily involved with all the supplies, needing to clear out a space and so on. So it's digital scrapbooking for me. I am an experienced user of Photoshop, Illustrator and other graphics editing and design software.<br /><br /> So why do I find an introductory book like this so appealing? Because scrapbooking is an art form unlike what I've done in the past. I need to develop new ways of seeing and not be bound by the restrictions of the kind of stuff I've been doing.<br /><br /> The authors provide that introduction based around Photoshop Elements (\"PE\"), a trial copy of which is on the included CD, but you'll want to download the current trial version from Adobe's site.<br /><br /> They take you through all the main features of using PE, but everything is centered on digitally scrapbooking.<br /><br /> The approach is very casual. Quick basic introductions first to camera vocabulary, cameras, scanners (and scanning ideas), printers (with an excellent short section on papers and specialty media).<br /><br /> Next is an introduction to \"Digital Layouts  101\", which is thorough, entertaining and educational. This is also a guide to your first steps in using Photoshop Elements.<br /><br /> After that, the book flows well into sections on image editing, using text, backgrounds and accents (the latter both digital and analog) and using digital kits.<br /><br /> The authors really do this well. The book is profusely illustrated with very striking and creative layouts that go beyond simply demonstrating the techniques described, but rather serve to illuminate and inspire. Unlike the work I've been doing, scrapbooking lets you throw traditional rules out the window and create to your heart's content.<br /><br /> \"Scrapbooking Digitally\" would be an excellent intro just to Photoshop Elements. Coupled with its focus on digital scrapbooking, it is an excellent introduction to both subjects.<br /><br />Jerry", "images": [], "asin": "1561589721", "parent_asin": "1561589721", "user_id": "AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA", "timestamp": 1294818530000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "The Great Event of the Nineteenth Century", "text": "Abraham Lincoln issued the final version of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Near the end of that year, the artist Francis Carpenter determined to paint \"a historical picture of the first reading of the Proclamation of Emancipation\". Carpenter spent six months in the White House beginning in February, 1864, created a historically important painting of the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to the cabinet, got to know Lincoln, and wrote a book detailing his experiences. Carpenter wrote that Lincoln told him regarding the Emancipation Proclamation: \"It is the central act of my administration, and the great event of the nineteenth century\".<br /><br />Professor Allen Guelzo tells the story of the Carpenter painting (p. 220-21), includes a photograph of the painting in the book, discusses Lincoln's statement to Carpenter (p. 186) and includes much more in his detailed study, \"Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America\" (2004). This book is a worthy successor to Professor Guelzo's recent study of Lincoln's religious and political beliefs in \"Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President\".<br /><br />Professor Guelzo takes issue with a historical interpretation of the Emancipation Proclamation beginning with Richard Hofstadter (1948) that argues that Lincoln had little concern with the status of black Americans and issued the Emancipation Proclamation only from reasons of prudence to protect the interests of white workers. Guelzo also approaches the Emancipation Proclamation to address recent arguments by African-American scholars skeptical of Lincoln's role and pessimistic about the future of race relations in the United States.<br /><br />Professor Guelzo agrees that Lincoln approached the question of Emancipation cautiously. He offers several reasons for this caution. One major reason was Lincoln's fear of the reaction of the Federal courts to an attempt by the Executive to emancipate the slaves. Lincoln had good grounds for this concern as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roger Taney, was the author of the notorious Dred Scott decision. Lincoln also had to act with the concerns of the border states in mind as these states were critical to the Union war effort; and he had to contend with generals and a substantial portion of the population of the North that would oppose any attempt to turn the Civil War from a war to preserve the Union to a war to free the slaves. To circumvent these obstacles, Lincoln proposed a system of compensated emancipation and asked the border states to adopt such a plan with Federal financial assistance. He also wanted to explore voluntary colonization efforts under which the freed slaves would be colonized in central America or in a location in the Western United States.<br /><br />Professor Guelzo describes how the border states resisted any notion of compensated emancipation. He also describes Federal legislative efforts, and efforts of some Union commanders, to protect former slaves making their way to the Union lines. These slaves were described by the term \"contraband\" and Congress enacted two limited statutes, called \"Confiscation Acts\" providing freedom for the \"contrabands.\"<br /><br />In 1862, Lincoln told Secretary of State Seward and, ultimately, the rest of the cabinet, that he had determined to free the slaves in the rebellious states. Although not a believer in any traditional sense, Lincoln stated that this course was forced upon him by God and Providence. He issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in September 22, 1862 and the final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863.<br /><br />Professor Guelzo describes the origins of the Proclamation, and the effect of its issuance on the Union, the Confederacy, the free blacks, and the slaves. He also describes the impact of the Proclamation on the foreign affairs of the United States and on the conduct of the War -- as is well known, following the Proclamation the Civil War changed in character to total warfare. He describes the precarious legal basis for the Emancipation Proclamation and points to Lincoln's courage and determination in the face of doubt. Although some scholars have argued that the Proclamation had, in fact, no legal effect and freed no slaves, Professor Guelzo argues persuasively that it was and remains the pivotal event of the Civil War and the single most important factor in the destruction of slavery.<br /><br />Following Lincoln's assassination, the Freedmen from the Southern states contributed funds for the construction of a statue of Lincoln emancipating a slave. The statue stands in Lincoln Park in Washington, D.C. It was dedicated in 1872, with remarks by Frederick Douglass. (I was moved to visit Lincoln Park to see the statue after hearing Professor Guelzo speak last year at a conference in Washington.) Douglass described Lincoln as \"a white man who shared the prejudices common to his countrymen towards the colored race.\" (p. 249) Yet he recognized that, in issuing the Proclamation Lincoln was \"swift, zealous, radical, and determined.\" (p. 250) In Professor Guelzo's words, the Emancipation Proclamation was \"an act of spectacular political daring\" (p.249)<br /><br />This is a thorough, well-balanced, yet inspiring study, of what indeed has fair title to be the Great Event of the Nineteenth Century. The book will help the reader understand where our country has been in securing racial justice and in bringing to pass and expanding upon the American dream.<br /><br />Robin Friedman", "images": [], "asin": "0743221826", "parent_asin": "0743221826", "user_id": "AENBSJOBQIUYW5UK3ESTAF7ECSGA", "timestamp": 1081787486000, "helpful_vote": 41, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Enjoyable tale if you read it on its own terms", "text": "Lyrically written, charming, and engaging, The Last Unicorn can be best appreciated if it is read on its own terms.  It is not a sweeping epic like any of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, nor a religious allegory like many of C.S. Lewis' works, nor a Disneyesque fairy tale with the perfunctory happy ending.  Anyone reading it and expecting some variant of these other works will be disappointed.  What The Last Unicorn does is take the traditional literary forms of the quest and the fairy tale, then stand them on their head in a very post-modern sort of way.  It does this to entice readers to ponder the philosophical questions that author Peter S. Beagle considers important.<br /><br />One certainly does not have to read The Last Unicorn in some deeply philosophical manner to enjoy it.  As a simple tale, it is entertaining enough, with wonderful prose, imagery, and characters that will stay with you for a long time.  There is the creaky witch, Mommy Fortuna, her Midnight Carnival, and the Harpy that will be her doom.  There is Schmendrick, the hapless magician, struggling to tap his inner wizard.  There is the genteel balladeer and highwayman, Captain Cully; his giant of a right-hand man, Jack Jingly; and his earthy charwoman, Molly Grue.  And, of course, there is the Unicorn herself, a majestic and magical creature, a primeval force of nature rooted in eternity itself.<br /><br />The tale itself begins with the Unicorn in her forest, discovering that she is apparently the very last Unicorn in the world. Although a solitary creature, this disturbs her greatly, so she begins a quest to find her people, leaving her beloved forest behind to travel a dangerous world.  Along the way, she meets new friends (Schmendrick, Molly Grue) who help her overcome the many ordeals and enemies that she encounters along the way.  Ultimately, the quests leads the Unicorn and her companions to the realm of King Haggard, the jaded and miserly ruler of a destitute kingdom by the sea, who may have had something to do with the disappearance of the Unicorns.  At this point, the tale makes some twists and turns, before reaching its final, bittersweet conclusion.<br /><br />Beneath the tale is a philosophical subtext that delights in exploring the answers to a variety of questions.  What is the nature of illusion?  Can we desire an illusion to be real so much that it does, in fact, become real - until its spell is broken?  What is the difference between time and eternity?  What would an eternal creature be like, and how would we react to it?  If an eternal creature could somehow be made to see things from a mortal's point of view, how would it react?  Beagle doesn't necessarily provide answers to all of these questions - at times, he just raises them for the reader to ponder.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Beagle can't resist dropping all-too-obvious hints that he is playing a friendly little game with his readers.  Anachronistic references to tacos and field recordings, a butterfly that spouts pop tunes from the 1930's, a talking skull that makes reference to \"character assassins\" - Beagle drops a number of not-so-subtle and unnecessary hints, calling the reader's attention to how he is violating the traditional norms of the literary form that he is using, and daring the reader to figure out why.  It's as if Beagle were sitting across the room from the reader, winking and smiling wryly.<br /><br />In the end, however, Beagle manages to pull off a difficult literary feat - creating a simple and enjoyable story that can be read at a deeper, more philosophical level.  The reader can approach it in either way and take something away from his work.  While it doesn't have quite the same emotional resonance for me as (say) any of Tolkien's works, the Last Unicorn deserves its status as a modern literary classic.", "images": [], "asin": "0451450523", "parent_asin": "0451450523", "user_id": "AHP2EAWCFQ2EC3F2Z7EZ6V7XLUVQ", "timestamp": 1297880414000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

There is no question that this book does not read or even flow as a typical history which in my view is a tribute to the creative author and a a risk taking publisher both of whom deserve high praise.<br /><br />It is the reader rather than a historian who benefit from this treatment.  The myriad of detail adds color and depth to the men's characters in a way that no regular history book has ever done.  Yes the detail slows the narative and yes the author is all over the place, retrospection, current event, future writing all withing a page or two and yet somehow the whole thing holds together and the information is assimilated in a lasting and meaningful way.<br /><br />The reasonings are so logical and fresh given the years and speculation and outright lies that they shine from the page.  One example - why was Custer not scalped.  Reasons given over the years run from Indian admiration for his courage to contempt.  The author's take,  Custer's hair was cut short for the campain, he was also going bald.  In short his scalp was so unatractive as a trophy, that no one bothered.<br /><br />The author engages in speculation and unlike regular historians, he readily admits when he is doing so.  For example he openly shared his puzzlement as to why certain versions of Custer's death are rejected by one generation only to be viewed as the most credible by furture generations.<br /><br />All and all this is a wonderful read and anyone with an interest in this history would benefit even if some of the facts shared conflict with previous ideas.<br /><br />Custer remains an inegma but this book comes as close as we are ever likely to get to understanding him and the men who served with him.", "images": [], "asin": "0883940884", "parent_asin": "0883940884", "user_id": "AHG6C6TFMFKIOQHSOZEYKPNTAFOA", "timestamp": 1179300028000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

At the same time Harry's half-brother, attorney Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer), is defending former gang member Da'Quan Foster, who's accused of raping and murdering assistant city manager Lexi Park.<br /><br />Mickey is convinced his client was set up and asks Harry to look into the case. Harry refuses because the idea of 'crossing' from catching criminals to helping them get off is abhorrent to him. Nevertheless, Harry takes a look at the LAPD's murder book and gets an inkling that Da'Quan might actually be innocent. The clue that intrigues Harry most is Lexi's expensive watch, which is missing.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two LAPD detectives have an inordinate interest in the Lexi Park case. They spy on Mickey and Harry, stop Mickey for a bogus DUI so they can search his car, and track the half-brothers with GPS devices. Then, when Harry starts to investigate the missing watch, more people are murdered. It's clear that something is rotten in the LAPD.<br /><br />The book moves along at a steady clip as Harry uncovers one clue after another, and builds to a satisfying climax. Full disclosure: I did get a tad impatient with a couple of sections about LAPD parking lots and gangs surveilling them, but this is a minor quibble.<br /><br />The secondary characters add interest to the book, including Harry's daughter Maddie - who's preparing for college, Harry's former partner Lucia - who secretly lends him a hand, and an Internal Affairs investigator that Harry has sparks with.<br /><br />The last part of the book has some juicy courtroom scenes (courtesy of Mickey Haller), which is icing on the cake of a good detective novel.

America 1844: Religious Fervor, Westward Expansion, and the Presidential Election that Transformed the Nation by John Bicknell follows the various strands of events that were independent of one another yet influenced each other with long term consequences.<br /><br />In the United States the year of 1844 was already going to be important due to the upcoming Presidential Election, yet the political maneuvering by the President without a party John Tyler would entirely change the upcoming campaign.  Through attempts to put potential rivals on the Supreme Court to kickstarting the issue of the annexation of Texas, Tyler\u2019s actions aided by southern slave-owning politicians upended the Presidential campaign as little-known Tennessean James K. Polk took the Democratic nomination to face off with longstanding Whig stalwart Henry Clay whose self-imposed wounds would help cost him the White House and change American history.  Another politically costly mistake for Clay and the Whigs was cozying up to nativists whose mob violence against Catholics particularly in Philadelphia not only sent the Catholic vote to the Democrats but also future Irish Catholic immigrants to New York and Boston.  A candidate for President that many today did not know ran was the founder of the Church of Latter-Day Saints, Joseph Smith, who to protect his followers ran to bring their constitutional rights to the fore only for an anti-Mormon mob to storm the jail he was housed in and kill him.  The resulting succession crisis led to Brigham Young\u2019s ascension to leadership and later his decision to head to the Great Salt Lake.  Young\u2019s decision was based on the pamphlets written by John C. Fremont explored the uncharted western portions of the North American continent along with numerous emigres journeying from the East to the West for a better more prosperous future.  And yet some Americans believed a better future was not on Earth but in Heaven as they eagerly anticipated the Second Coming based on the teachings of William Miller and his associates, while confused after the passing of Miller\u2019s belief it would occur in the spring of that year the news that Miller had been off by seven months ignited hope throughout the extended Millerite community only for the Great Disappointment of October 22 to bring confusion to their beliefs.  By the end of the year the course of America\u2019s future would be set, the expansion westward would cause war with Mexican and later Civil War that would uproot slavery while allowing the two largest indigenous American founded religions to grow and expand in the Church of Latter-Day Saints and the Seventh-day Adventist church, the largest successor of the Millerite movement.<br /><br />Bicknell covers all the above in almost 260 pages, attempting\u2014for the most part successfully\u2014to give cover the year chronologically through separating themes in each chapter.  The overall history is generally correct and the addition of journeys of western pioneers gives the book more \u201clife\u201d then the sometimes stall retellings of political maneuverings back in the 19th Century.  There are some little nitpick items related to the Millerites' \u201cspring disappointment\u201d, but nothing that is majorly erroneous.<br /><br />America 1844 is a concise look at 366 days in the life of the United States that saw it\u2019s political and religious life changed dramatically with significant influence on the future, not only immediately but long term.", "images": [], "asin": "1613738811", "parent_asin": "1613738811", "user_id": "AFLGBVEMLLK253RZFCAKA224C4GA", "timestamp": 1609346999480, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "A Pleasurable Romp for Those Familiar with Norse Mythos", "text": "I am a Lokean devotee and a lover of all things readable, so I am always on the hunt for any new Loki-themed books I can get my hands on.<br /><br />I'm happy to say \"Father of Monsters\" did not disappoint! It's a fun, fast-paced adventure through the world of Norse mythology, with plenty of clever twists on the old stories. If you aren't familiar with most of the Norse pantheon, the characters and their motivations may be a little hard to grasp, as this story picks up around events that took place near the latter half of the myths' timeline. If you have a general idea of the gods' roles and history, though, it is plenty easy to grasp.<br /><br />The story is fast-paced and smooth, following Loki on his journeys between Asgard, the realm of the Aesir gods, and Jotunheim, the realm of the magically-gifted giants. The central conflict revolves around Loki's desire for godhood, which requires he serve Odin and the other Aesir (often against the Jotun, his own people), and his love for his family, particularly his Jotun wife Angrboda and their serpent son Jormungandr.<br /><br />The story incorporates several of the most popular myths, including Thor's Journey to Utgard, The Theft of Mjolnir, Thor's Fishing Trip, and references to many others such as Loki and the Master Builder and The Death of Baldr. Rather than being a simple retelling, though, these are woven together into a new narrative that feels very true to Loki's character and gives him and the other Aesir and Jotnar a much more three-dimensional, human character than many of the myth collections do.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book fans of Loki or Norse mythology in general. It's a refreshing take on the myths we're all familiar with, and a very pleasant way to pass a few hours.", "images": [], "asin": "0578367785", "parent_asin": "0578367785", "user_id": "AGXRAH3MP553GB3M2E3FDZUXKU6A", "timestamp": 1676874584399, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Interesting relationship between religion and economics", "text": "The main argument of this book is to show that \u201cour ideas about economics and economic policy have long-standing roots in religious thinking.\u201d It appears that the influence of religious belief had a profound effect on Western economics. The book that had a most influential effect on shaping Western ideas was The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. In this book, Smith fully developed an explanation for the private-interest-leads-to-public-good idea.<br /><br />Initially Calvinist doctrines, which dominated English and Scottish religious life since the Reformation, seemed to pervade Western thinking, but eventually came into conflict with the Protestant movement that \u201cbrought new ideas about human nature, about the purpose of men and women\u2019s lives on earth, and about their destiny after their mortal lives end,\u201d according to the author. As Einstein made clear any line of creative thinking follows from and is coherent with the worldview that underlies it. An interesting point made was that the very distinction between secular and religious is a modern concept, which was unknown throughout most of human history. Throughout the discussion, we are introduced to various players, such as Thomas Hobbes, Anthony Ashley Cooper, Pierre de Boisguilbert, Bernard Mandeville, Pierre Nicole, and others.<br /><br />Getting back to Adam Smith, his first book focused on the inner thoughts of individuals, but his second book, Wealth of Nations, discussed the origins and evolution of social institutions, especially the organization of economic life. With this book, Smith \u201cassumed a place in the forefront of Enlightenment thinkers that he has held ever since.\u201d It is with this book that the fundamental basis of what is now called economics was established. But underlying this brilliant work was something else at work that was shaping the worldview. An important contribution that framed the intense and sometimes violent debate over religious ideas in which Smith lived was the teachings of John Calvin. After his death, his teaching spread rapidly within the expanding Protestant world. In time, however, as the author explains in depth, the Calvinist orthodoxy gave way to a Protestantism divorced from Calvinist ideology. These religious ideas, discussed in detail in the book, carried implications for how to think about the secular world. The author notes that \u201cnot only did the transition in thinking that set the foundation for modern economics closely follow the movement away from orthodox Calvinism in time, the two shared a logical coherence as well.\u201d These ideas came to form an essential part of the worldview that Adam Smith and others believed. By the latter half of the eighteenth century, deism was widespread in America, Scotland and England \u2013 probably the belief of Smith as well. In fact, in America the religious thinking of men such as Mather, Edwards, Cooper, and others followed the line of reasoning that \u201caccepting the moral legitimacy of self-interest while seeking a means of limiting and regulating it, was fully congruent with the view of competitive markets soon laid out by Adam Smith.\u201d By the time of the Scottish Enlightenment, religion and politics throughout most of Europe had been intertwined for over two centuries, according to the author. For example, free trade was determined to not just be practical but was a core religious imperative. Men like John McVickar and Francis Wayland felt international trade was the will of a benevolent God. It brought nations together \u2013 as God desired. Francis Bowen of Harvard, made explicit that the basis for human\u2019s behavior in the economic sphere was the will of a \u201cbenevolent God operating through Newtonian laws of nature.\u201d God\u2019s will seemed to figure in all things. The minister Jonathan Edwards thought that the millennium would start in America. Many thought the American experiment was clearly of divine origin, including political leaders. We see the contributions of numerous theologians on these matters, such as William Lawrence, Russell Conwell, Henry Ward Beecher, John Bates Clark, and others.<br /><br />Two philosophies began to emerge by the end of the nineteenth century: The Gospel of Wealth and the Social Gospel. Each reflected a powerful postmillennial sense of mission for the future. The former saw private initiative and unrestricted markets as the principle of economic advance, and the latter favored unions and a government intervention. \u201cEconomics, properly conceived and implemented, was the route to the millennium.\u201d By 1908, the creation of the Federal Council of Churches, which encompassed most of the mainline Protestant denominations represented a coming together of both philosophies. By the time of the Great Depression, we see a uniting of religious and economic conservatism with some calling the New Deal an American name for Russian Communism and Roosevelt a dictator. Note that the people saying these things were conservative clergyman and theologians, and they enjoyed the \u201csupport of powerfully motivated and financially well-endowed members of the business community.\u201d In the early and middle decades of the nineteenth century, religious thinking had influenced American economic ideas, notes the author. The markets-based economic theorizing thus bore a positive affinity with the religious thinking that inspired it.<br /><br />Finally, today we see economics has become sufficiently mature as an intellectual discipline that the great majority of practitioners no longer shape their thinking via the force of religion persuasion. This is not true, however, of popular opinion. And the bugaboo is no longer communism, but secular humanism, which has taken the place of the former \u201cas the intellectual and cultural enemy in the nation\u2019s internal political battles.\u201d So, we see that \u201cfrom it\u2019s inception as a recognizable intellectual discipline, economics had been influenced by religious ideas.\u201d", "images": [], "asin": "B087PL2ZCB", "parent_asin": "B087PL2ZCB", "user_id": "AFK3XXDVSPJVMBSID5NPHNNUUGJA", "timestamp": 1625614249945, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I learned that this was the second volume and that I needed to find out what had happened before. Thankfully, Wikipedia exists, so I was quickly able to catch up. I have to say, this series is a realistic look at how society would most likely deal with superheroes. They would, of course, be viewed with some stigmatism by the non-powered members of society. This was pretty inventive, and made me think of Alan Moore's Watchmen. Having read many of the other books in the series now, this book really just brings the audience in slowly to get them used to what the heck is going on.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Much More than a Baseball Book", "text": "Joseph Schuster's \"The Might-Have-Been\" is a terrific baseball book in the vein of \"The Natural\" or \"For Love of the Game\", but it's also a well-told 'Everyman' mid-life crisis novel on par with some of the best of the genre (for me, something like \"Straight Man\" or \"The Sportswriter\").  This novel wins on both levels and is easily one of my favorite reads of the past 12 months.<br /><br />\"The Might-Have-Been\" is the story of Edward Everett Yates--brief MLB professional and a man who's essentially committed his life to the game he loves.  The novel spans 30 plus years as Schuster details Yates' brief time in the majors and more interestingly, Yates struggles to deal with his life as it is (and the human condition in general).  Yates is depicted as a slightly better than average minor leaguer who finally gets his shot in the show only to get injured in a rain-shortened (non-official) game in which he hits for the cycle.  An earlier substitution for Lou Brock and a base on balls in his only at bat is the only blip in the MLB record books for Yates.  And as with many athletes, Yates cannot let go of his dream.  Schuster puts it best himself when he writes (about Yates): \"He realized they had seen the open door to the world outside the locker room as an invitation and not banishment; baseball was just an interesting visa stamp in the passport of their lives, while he had gotten stuck at the border, unable to cross.\"<br /><br />Yates dabbles in the family business and has some success there, but baseball's grip is too strong.  Schuster moves the story on nicely as the somewhat sympathetic Yates makes one dubious decision after another (both in job choices and relationships) seemingly doomed to spend a life in the game that's dealt him so many cruel blows.  It's a well told story, and despite Yates' poor decision making (easy to judge from outside and behind), Schuster makes him a character I could cheer for.  This is a very entertaining novel--both for the baseball fan and for the fan of great fiction.  Schuster again (via Yates): \"Be grateful for the life you have rather than regret over the one you don't.\"  This novel is a treasure and very highly recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "0345530268", "parent_asin": "0345530268", "user_id": "AHJHV5R773UVUAGDTIIHULFY2VZQ", "timestamp": 1333311911000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "A STELLAR historical crime novel!", "text": "Smoke and Ashes truly deserves five stars.<br />The first star is for the most important element: an interesting story and a well-done dramatic climax.<br />The second star is for the setting, which vividly evokes India in 1921.<br />The third star is for the history I learned along the way about the independence movement Mahatma Gandhi led during this period and for the way it was woven into the story so well and so believably.  I  especially appreciated the author\u2019s note at the end to tell me what was real and what was fiction. Prince Edward really did visit India in 1921, for example, and Chitta Ranjan Das, his wife Basanti Das, and Subhash Bose, who play important roles in the book, were historical personages of great importance in Gandhi\u2019s non-violent independence struggle.<br />The fourth star is for the protagonist character, police captain Sam Wyndham. Sam is an excellent narrator for the book as he struggles with several important issues. His role as a police officer overseeing Indian society is not an easy one. Clearly he has adapted to the society and come to appreciate it in many ways, even going so far as to share rooms with his Indian partner Surendranath, known to the British as Surrender-not.  Even more difficult is Sam\u2019s addiction to opium as a result of his experiences in WWI. I give Mukherjee high marks for his handling of this aspect of the character; too often protagonists in crime novels who have a serious dysfunction become cardboard sufferers, but Sam is a well-developed believable person.<br />Finally, a fifth star for tying all these elements together with  some darned good writing, which made me often highlight passages such as this one: \u201cCalcutta was as flawed and dysfunctional as I was: a city built in the middle of a fetid Bengal swamp, populated by misfits all struggling to survive against the odds.\u201d<br />I have not read the first two books in this series, but after reading Smoke and Ashes I am not at all surprised that the first book,  A Rising Man, won the CWA Historical Dagger Award and was shortlisted for the Edgar for Best Novel.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent for Review, to Practice or even to Learn for the First Time", "text": "This book is intended to help someone taking a chemistry class, preparing for a test (including professional tests for fields like nursing) or who is working on self-study on his/her own. It is a brilliant set-up--1001 questions (actually, as the title says, problem solving in some cases) covering major introductory topics in chemistry. At the end of this section--actually, over half of it--comes the answers.<br /><br />Several things especially standout in the design of this book. First, the wonderful idea of building a review around a significant number of questions/problems (averaging over 60 a section) with the answers in the back of the book. (I liked the way the questions, regardless of chapters, are numbered 1-1001 and so are the answers. It makes it easy to look up.<br /><br />Each book has a different &#34;access code&#34; in the back so you can also go online to practice. The online questions are the same as the book's, but it means you can practice on various devices, at your convenience, wherever you are.<br /><br />There is a free &#34;cheat sheet&#34; that you can access at the &#34;Dummies&#34; website (an interesting website for other subjects, too). It is a list of a few helpful things to remember when solving chemistry problems. (The book also has useful tips at the beginning of every section, &#34;What to Watch Out For&#34; as well as an overview of the key concepts of each section you'll be going through).<br /><br />I liked that questions start with the easiest ones in each chapter then go to moderate and finish with the hardest. They're not just randomly arranged as with many practice books.<br /><br />I like that the answers are not just a few words, but also give explanations. You are asked to solve a significant amount of problems where you apply or explain the concepts (not just rote memorization-type questions) in each section and the answers include the equation as well as the explanation.<br /><br />Chs 1 - 5  The Basics of Chemistry (units, scientific notation, matter & energy, atoms/nuclear chemistry; the Periodic Table. There is not one included in this book, so be sure to have your own available)<br /><br />Chs  6 - 8  Chemical Bonding<br /><br />Chs  9 - 11 Chemical Reactions<br /><br />Chs 12 - 14 Acids, bases, liquids and gases<br /><br />Ch.  15  Graphing<br /><br />For example, Ch. 4, &#34;The Atom&#34; begins with questions like, &#34;How many electrons are in an atom of bromine?&#34; and &#34;An atom has a mass number of 14 and 6 electrons. How many protons and neutrons does the atom have?&#34; and ends with &#34;If a radioactive sample decays from 2.5 kg to 0.61 g and the isotope has a half-life of 9.35 hours, how much time has passed?&#34;<br /><br />I found it useful and interesting and I think beginning chemistry students or those who need to review for various kinds of tests, will get a lot of benefit from this.Definitely recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "1118549325", "parent_asin": "1118549325", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1410677355000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

But while there are a host of amazing cookbooks out there that have given me my repetoire, I had not been able to go 'beyond the cookbook' until I got &quot;The Indian Grocery Store Demystified&quot;.  Beforehand, my visits to the Indian market were very rewarding in that I could identify all the ingredients I needed for my recipes, but I was left with no explanation of what all that other STUFF could be used for. This book helped me to recognize all the wonderful products available, and how they could be used to leap beyond the recipe pages, and actually construct dishes and menus of my very own.  Thanks to Linda Bladholm, I am less of a book-taught hobbyist working endlessly to perfect my craft, and more of an intuitive home chef creating satisfying dishes inspired by products that formerly left me puzzled and intimidated.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Death Overdue!", "text": "Carrie Singleton is thinking about moving from her hometown of Clover Ridge, Connecticut until she becomes the head of programs and events at the local haunted library. Her first event is the presentation by a retired homicide detective, Al Buckley, who believes he knows who murdered Laura Foster, a part-time library aide who was beaten to death fifteen years earlier. After he bites into a cookie during the presentation, he drops dead. After the medical examiner reveals that poison killed Al, Carrie feels guilty and decides to investigate the murders. With the help of a friendly ghost, Carrie finds more secrets are hidden in the shadows and needs to find the truth before someone believes her death is overdue.<br />This is a great read for anyone who loves a cozy, fun mystery. I instantly liked the main character, Carrie, and how she had different sides to her character, one reserved librarian and the other a little Goth. I loved how the library\u2019s ghost was not scary, but friendly and informative. Carrie\u2019s aunt and uncle were a good sounding board and showed love whenever possible.  With enough suspense and red herrings to keep the reading light burning throughout the night, I would recommend this book to any mystery lover.

{"rating": 5, "title": "For Expert and Civil War Buff", "text": "Dr. Hess has authored one of the most significant books in print on the use of field fortifications during the US Civil War and the relationship of these works to the actual campaigns. Although there are some other books that do include some of this information, including several excellent post-war sources from the 19th century, this book does a remarkable job of putting the subject in perspective.  Many so called \"Civil War\" experts simply do not realize the significance of the role of field and permanent fortifications during many of the key campaigns of the war and reduce everything to simple terms stating \"there were breastworks, etc...\"  They simply give no detail and the reader can not understand such details as why some of these \"works\" were easily overrun, why some railroad cuts made great defensive positions and others did not, or even why on Cemetary Ridge at Gettysburg the troops of II Corps could not entrench themselves.<br /><br />Hess not only describes what the defenses consisted of, but also shows how they affected the campaign. He also includes background information as well as detailing the events related to the campaigns.  The book does not rehash the old story of bullets and beans in these operations, instead with Hess we see its bullets, beans and spades.<br /><br />  The reader will soon notice this book does not cover all the operations of the Civil War where fortifications were involved, but that is because this is the first volume with two additional ones planned.  The publisher did a good job in reproducing the photos.  One serious flaw is a lack of maps for the reader to follow everything mentioned in the text.  This usually results from the publisher attempting to save on production expenses and there is not much the author can do to correct it.

I'll read it, and I mostly like it, but it's not one my favorite genres so I don't seek it out. Short stories are iffy, as well. I'm sure it's hard to fit a complete story into such a small word count. And many authors who write short stories, should be writing novels. They just try to put too much story into a small space, and the reader ends up feeling like we've missed something important.<br /><br />Neither one of these issues was a problem when I read Unspoken Stories - Volume 1 by B.C. Young. The stories were interesting, complete, and even though they're only a few pages each, they're long enough to get you hooked and make you care about the characters. In fact, one of the stories made me cry, and we all know that's not allowed. Even so, I'll be giving this book five stars.You can read the official summary of the stories above. Keep reading for my summary of the stories.<br /><br />\"Copy Bird\": A post-apocalyptic survivor and what may be the smartest bird ever.<br />\"Going Home\": An emotional story of a soldier visiting his family.<br />\"Josie Dorri and the Coffee Ban\": An interesting story about choices.

{"rating": 5, "title": "The Margo Guide to Budget Hotels in France", "text": "\"European hotels do not have facecloths. I always pack mine. Showers: I haven't figured out why some showers don't have shower curtains on them.\" ~Margo<br /><br />On my last trip to France, this book would have come in handy. One of the hotels I stayed at in Paris did not even have shower curtains and when I sat on the bed, the bed literally collapsed. This was in a very nice hotel and I was shocked. While the tour guide seemed oblivious to the predicament, I never forgot the experience. The breakfast the next morning and tour was of course worth the effort of having to put the bed back together.<br /><br />A guide by Margo would have helped me select my own hotel accommodations that weekend. I also found I wanted to spend more time in various locations and a tour to Paris seemed rushed on a weekend. I wanted to spend an entire week, no a month just wandering around France. When we traveled to Provence, I had no idea where to stay and while we found nice hotels, it was purely by chance and we had no idea what to expect. When at the Louvre I wandered around not realizing I could get a portable headset to explain some of the paintings.<br /><br />Throughout this guide to Budget Hotels in France, Margo selects the best hotels and explains why a double bed is cheaper than twin beds and why you might be able to ask for a \"zip and lock\" king-size bed (they might put two beds together), but why king-size beds are not something you will find in Budget hotels.<br /><br />If you love to cook, you might want to look for the Culinary School listing. There are detailed descriptions of all the hotels, including unique creative touches like she mentions the way the rooms are decorated. Will you have to climb stairs, do you want a garden/patio, does the room have a view of the Eiffel Tower?<br /><br />Margo spent ten weeks traveling around France and went to 30 of the most popular cities to explore the hotels she has written about. She spent her own money and time to produce this book and no hotel or restaurant has paid to be in this book. If where you stay is as important as the sites you will visit, then this is the book for you. A list of French Phrases for checking in is included. If you want to spend more money eating out and touring the cities, then this guide will also help you save money.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "images": [], "asin": "0965394476", "parent_asin": "0965394476", "user_id": "AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA", "timestamp": 1137988638000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Must-read for mid-size company CEO's, executives and managers", "text": "Sher gets right to the point. As a consultant to medium and small companies, it is frustrating for me to explain to a mid-sized company manager why those MBA case studies don\u2019t apply and won\u2019t work for them. This book summarizes why managing a mid-sized company is different as it relates to risk tolerance and talent development.  Then Sher exposes 7 problem areas specific to mid-size companies. Meeting deadlines, tinkering, \u201cshoot from the hip\u201d strategies, acquisitions, operations, cash management, and dysfunctional leaders. Many of the case studies reveal the importance of common sense which isn\u2019t too common at all. Like: let your cash flow finance your growth, don\u2019t leverage the entire company on a single strategy when you\u2019ve got a solid performer that is profitable, don\u2019t do M&A if your staff doesn\u2019t know M&A, recruit right. The people he interviewed are highly intelligent and motivated. And they still made these mistakes. It\u2019s much cheaper to read and learn from their examples. The nuggets are non-stop as he goes deep into data, case studies and analysis in each of these 7 areas. His personas he describes from a dysfunctional company hit me like a ton of bricks. I\u2019ve personally worked with every single one of the \u201ctypes\u201d he described.<br /><br />The real life company examples keep the book engaging and easy to read. The lessons are so fundamental and specific to mid-sized companies yet so easily overlooked that I expect that managers won\u2019t just read this book and then store it on a shelf. Managers and leaders would be well served to keep this book handy on their desk, reviewing it over and over every few months.", "images": [], "asin": "1629560065", "parent_asin": "1629560065", "user_id": "AECN6NFOOZI6RMUMDJW4X2MJDEGA", "timestamp": 1409620411000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 5, "title": "A Must Read for all women", "text": "Today I am reviewing Brave Enough by Nicole Unice this book is about dealing with your fears and this is something I have struggled with for a long time. I love how in Chapter 3 she talked about partnering with others and how it is okay to reach out to others when you need help this hit a chord with me because I struggle with reaching out to others when I need help because I just don't want to bother people with my troubles, and I try to do things myself. I learned through that section on partnership that it is okay to reach out to others because they will spur you on in your journey with the Lord.<br /><br />In Chapter 5 she talks about anger in depth which I have struggled with my anger a lot and I really never understood because there are some people that I have anger against the exercise in the book she had was to write in a journal or a piece of paper of the following prompts such as &#34;I'm sad about.., I'm scared about..., I'm mad about... then you were to write about whatever comes to mind and then if you couldn't come up with anything then she said spend five more minutes reflecting on that statement. Finally, she said to leave your feelings right where they are which was a great exercise because it showed me the things that I was angry about.<br /><br />Finally, I loved Chapter 8 because it talked about us women knowing our limits and learning how to say no things that we are not able to commit to which I have struggled with boundaries because at times I want to do it all. I identify with one of the ladies in the story because there are times that I will have anxiety attacks and get so overwhelmed, but that's because I reached my limit and did not stop to pause and reflect. We also need to take a rest day ladies and yes with kids it is hard to do, but it must be done in order for us to recharge our batteries and this is basically what this Chapter is saying.

Having been asked to review this book I bought it for my kindle as I was drawn to the description which said it &#34;dabbles in provocative subjects such as psychic phenomena, economics, morality, masochism, color, jazz, history, and a bit of romance with an NYPD detective&#34;  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />First, let me talk about the negative aspect of the book.  The author would have made this even better with just a bit more editing and maybe one more pass with a copy editor.  Each scene change has a heading which in the beginning was distracting but I will say as the story developed this was not as bothersome.<br /><br />The story itself is gripping and I found it hard to put down.  The writer draws you in quickly and at times I forgot I was reading a work of fiction.  If you have ever seen a film with a famous actor who makes you forget that you are watching them act, then you know what I mean.  The transition from past to present was easy to follow and never &#34;pulled&#34; me out of the story.<br /><br />The character, Maud Strand, is one I would like to read more about.  She seemed to me, to be more interesting than Madame Budska.  Based on the title the author seems to disagree, hopefully she will change her mind.<br /><br />The ending was slightly rushed and left me wondering about what was going to happen to Maud.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Against All Odds", "text": "Holy s***. I haven't had a book depress me, disgust me, inspire me, and compel me this much in a long time. It's a book filled with injustice and I applaud Damien Echols for making it through this insane and maddening ordeal.<br /><br />I had followed the West Memphis Three case extensively when I was in high school. For those of you who aren't familiar with the case, in 1993 three teenage boys in Arkansas were wrongly convicted of satanically murdering three little boys. It was a very modern day Salem witch trial and Jason and Jessie were given life imprisonment and Damien was given the death sentence simply for being the town \"outcasts.\" I watched the 3 HBO \"Paradise Lost\" documentaries and read \"The Devil's Knot,\" but nothing touched me more than Echols memoir of the incident and his experiences in prison.<br /><br />After Damien was found guilty he spent EIGHTEEN years on death row and his life was utter hell. In this book he describes the fellow prisoners, daily rituals, and how hard it is to keep sane when you're in solitary confinement. It is a true triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />This memoir is written quite eloquently and goes back and forth between memories of his childhood, coping with the WM3 case, his life in prison, and his life as a free man (he was released mid 2011). The prose sticks with you and you find yourself going on an emotional rollercoaster ride with Damien as he recounts some of the worst points of his life.<br /><br />This is seriously a must read. Despite all the odds, Damien came through a horrific ordeal that kept him imprisoned for half of his life. Injustice like this cannot be forgotten.

Nearly half the country has Facebook accounts with around 875 million users, which would make Facebook the world's third most populous country if it was a political sovereignty. On May 17, 2012, Facebook, Inc. held an initial public offering negotiating a share price of $38 valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. Despite the shakiness of the stock value in the weeks since, there is no getting around the fact that entrepreneurs and enterprises recognize a need for a Facebook presence to partake in a piece of the burgeoning social commerce pie. Social media mavens Brian Carter and Justin Levy provide an effective primer that helps the relative online neophyte get started on Facebook with the intent of optimizing it for business and branding.<br /><br />The book effectively breaks down a lot of features which may not be readily apparent from a personal user standpoint such as how exactly Facebook's News Feed works. Blending top stories and recent entries, the feed is determined through an internal algorithm called EdgeRank and is calculated by the unique mix of friends and pages with which you interact the most. Consequently, you will see more of the types of posts (statuses, photos, videos and questions) you interact with, and in turn, less of those you don't. The co-authors discuss changes in Facebook's privacy policy, how these could affect your business and what you need to know about the limits of online privacy. Moreover, they teach you how to design custom landing tabs, event platforms and measure your Facebook performance. In turn, the co-authors go on to describe how to make the most of advertising campaigns on Facebook and the role of community building around corporate causes, commercial or otherwise.<br /><br />The section on analytics is probably the most critical part of the book because Carter and Levy give clear guidance on how to access data about users and their interactions on a business's pages and how to use Google Analytics and other third-party tools to gain deeper knowledge about their user base. Easily the most entertaining section focuses on the successful use cases for Facebook and how the best pages leverage existing websites by means of the Like button, as well as the chat and comments features. It details how Facebook Credits works and explains why virtual currency is an essential monetization effort by Facebook.  I especially enjoyed the \"Best in Class Facebook Pages\" whose subjects range from Barack Obama to Brian Solis to Volkswagen. Even though the edition I read was published this year, it didn't go into the replacement of the Profile with the Timeline and the controversy that decision engendered. Regardless, it's a solid how-to book for those just beginning to consider Facebook as a viable channel for business development.", "images": [], "asin": "078974113X", "parent_asin": "078974113X", "user_id": "AEBZFMNIRS5U4DQN2BVEYZFKRXEA", "timestamp": 1338961121000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "\"I was born beautiful\"", "text": "The Gist:<br />Darcy Rhone thought she was living a charmed life.  She had a fabulous job (in PR, of course), a fabulous fiance (gorgeous, ivy-league lawyer), and more designer clothes than Paris Hilton.  In fact, she was fabulous from the top of her perfectly coifed head to the tips of her Jimmy Choos.  Could life be any more charming or fabulous?<br /><br />Then, one day shortly before her wedding, she visits her best friend only to find her fiance hiding in a closet..sans pants.<br /><br />To make matters worse, she discovers her fling with her fiance's friend has resulted in a pregnancy!<br /><br />What's a fabulous girl to do?  Dump her fiance, quit her job, pack her Louis Vuitton and head to London to start a new, even-more-fabulous life.<br /><br />Something Blue is a light, easy read. As fun as any other novel in the chic lit genre.  Though, I did like Ms. Giffin's Baby Proof better.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Emily Giffin is a talented writer.  She is deft at creating characters and crafting interesting, believable, engaging dialogue.  Her plots are simple enough, and yet, keep the reader involved until the very last word.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Darcy Rhone, the heroine, had absolutely no redeeming qualities through the first half of the book.  She was crass, crude, self-absorbed, selfish, cruel, snotty, and insufferably ignorant.  In case my laundry list of her horrible traits didn't give it away, you need to know that I hated her.  Hated her.  I laothed her from her very first utterance: \"I was born beautiful.\"  Because I felt so strongly about Darcy Rhone, so negatively, I found her transformation difficult to believe.  After a hundred plus pages of her cheating on her fiance, screaming like a lunatic, spouting profanities like the Trevi Fountain spouts water, I just found it hard to believe she would magically transform into a maternal, thoughtful person.  One friend tells her that she is selfish and she suddenly decides to turn over a new leaf, to start acting like a considerate, kind human being?  I didn't buy it.<br /><br />And, the just plain UGLY:<br />The first few chapters of Something Blue are filled with self-absorbed, immoral characters who seem to spend inordinate amounts of time having casual sex, imbibing copious quantities of alcohol, and acting in ways that make it painfully difficult for any reader to uncover a single redeeming quality about them.  Though I have no problem reading books or watching tv shows about free, independent, liberated women (am, in fact, a rabid Sex and the City fan even all these years later), I was put off by Darcy's frequent profane, childish, and inane oubursts.  I could almost hear her screeching (which is a credit to Ms. Giffin's ability to sketch a character).<br /><br />The bottom line:<br />Emily Giffin's outstanding writing and well-paced plot make this book a great beach read.  Readers who have delicate ears and sensibilities might take offense at Darcy's promiscuity and profanity.  However, readers who like the fun and escape offered by books of the chic lit genre will appreciate Something Blue!", "images": [], "asin": "B0018SWA56", "parent_asin": "B0018SWA56", "user_id": "AE7AQ2KNKFVJHUEE3SQUFVVNUCZQ", "timestamp": 1213765088000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Family fun", "text": "This is a very colorful book splattered with Emeril's image throughout in various stages of posed animation. This book is intended for children to use with their parents or if you are so inclined to read  yourself about food preperation . The fact that the information is global is very appealing. Emeril begins with some basic lessons concerning safety , nuts and bolts and other good things to know before you actually attempt cooking a meal.The first destination is Breakfast with recipes from Spain, Mexico, England, Switzerland and other countries. The choice of dishes are savory yet pretty simple for beginner cooks and usually limited to under ten steps. There is a small cultural lesson and flag representing the country of origin to go with the dish as well as a did you know section for each recipe. Next is Sightseeing Snacks, Salads and Starters with adventures into new countries like vietnam, Italy , Greece, Japan and others not used in breakfast.Onward to Globe-Trotting Soups and Sandwiches, continuing with Main Meal Masterpieces where the dishes are a little more challenging but doable with additional information on A Guide to Sides, the Bread Map and Sweet Snapshots. At over 200 pages with large print this book  is good for the novice cook or student who wants to help prepare a meal with adult supervision. The oversized drawings and comical nature of Emeril's photographs make for what is intended to be a fun time in the kitchen. This is definitely a companion book where the adult and child must use the book together otherwise the child may have a problem in the kitchen. The meals are all pretty nutritious but have no caloric information. I think it is pretty cool for Emeril to take his personality and lend it to an educational endeavor where he combines his culinary talents with learning about other cultures. This would make a good school library book or one for a parent to share with their child. The reading level is fairly simple. This book will appeal to young readers with culinary ambitions ages 10-18.", "images": [], "asin": "0060739266", "parent_asin": "0060739266", "user_id": "AFIA5YDIOGEGNRECRIKC2U72H3SQ", "timestamp": 1167767016000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "When in Rome, do as the Romans do...", "text": "\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" is the mantra followed by Glen Husak and her husband, Al, as they embark on an annual Passeggiata, an Italian journey that continues less for the sake of a goal than for the movement itself.  In her travel memoir, named for this journey of movement, Glen recounts the highlights and pitfalls of their visits to Italy since 1993.  They began their travels as amateurs frequently getting lost and trusting in merchants to charge the correct amount of lire, but have emerged as seasoned Italiaphiles equally at home in Houston and Rome.<br /><br />Visiting northern and southern Italy in March, Glen and Al have avoided crowds, however this comes at the expense of many tourist amenities not yet being open for the season.  The Husak's have found the upside to this scenario and actually relish the discovery of un-touristy spots in the hill towns, Rome, Naples and beyond.  From churches and monasteries to restaurants and hotels, taking the less traveled path has worked well for this couple.<br /><br />Functioning as a travel memoir, Glen shares much of their adventures with the reader. Anticipating my own trip to Italy, I appreciate the insight into Italian travel however I couldn't help but be disappointed when reading the description of a lovely caf\u00e9 or hotel without ever being given the name of it.  I would have loved to support these families on my own trip!  Glen's love for Italy jumps off the page at the reader as she goes on in quite lengthy descriptions of things. At this point, her teaching profession becomes apparent to the reader as you feel her being redundant in overemphasizing a lesson or memory that was easily understood and appreciated the first time.  One frustration with this book was the lack of preparedness exhibited by Glen and Al when sight seeing.  How many times did they need to leave their camera in the hotel room and then encounter a photograph worthy moment before learning to always have it with them when traveling through such beautiful country?!<br /><br />Overall, the reader, whether having been to Italy or planning a trip there, will enjoy the Husak's perspective on a culture so different from the United States.  Hopefully those that follow a path to Italy will learn \"la dolce far niente\" or the sweetness of doing nothing as experienced by the Husak's.<br /><br />Author's Website: [...]", "images": [], "asin": "141968289X", "parent_asin": "141968289X", "user_id": "AGP7XCQRYXAYRFHJW4I33BCPL6UQ", "timestamp": 1234367111000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "A pleasure to read", "text": "Corrections is a wonderful read - the sort of book you immerse yourself in for several days. It is a painfully realistic dissection of the internal dynamics and tensions of pretty ordinary family life, and the sort of value shifts that occurred in the latter half of the 20th century (at least in western, Americanised cultures, such as mine).<br />What I particularly liked was the shifting viewpoints; Franzen has managed to get into the subconscious, perhaps the soul of family relationships, and help us to understand the motivations, foibles and passions of very ordinary people - people who we can recognise, parts of whom it is not too difficult to imagine being able to see in ourselves.<br />I am especially interested in the relationship of adult children to their elderly parents (probably reflecting the stage of life I am at) and I think Franzen has written about this with poignancy, but without maudlin or schmaltzy excess, which may have been the result in a lesser writer's hands.<br />It is thoroughly contemporary, and at the same time explores some universal themes. The social mores and conventions may change over generations, but the need to examine them and hold them up to the light do not diminish. What Jane Austen achieved with 19th century social relationships in a certain cultural setting, so does Franzen.<br />It is also very funny in parts.<br />I recommend it without hesitation.", "images": [], "asin": "0312421273", "parent_asin": "0312421273", "user_id": "AESFQEPQRIXE4VJD2DR3QWZJHJCQ", "timestamp": 1031809684000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Loved this book. Teriffic writing. My highest recommendation.", "text": "I LOVED this book! Cannot emphasize this enough. Never judge a book by its cover, because the cover here is so bland and boring that I don't know what the publisher was thinking. But the story inside!<br /><br />Anthony Varallo's THE LINES is the story of one family's slow disintegration in the aftermath of a separation. It is an EVERYMAN kind of story, and I think Varallo made a conscious decision to make it that. Because the principal characters have no names. They are, simply, the mother, the father, the girl and the boy. The parents, early to mid-thirties, the girl is ten, the boy seven. The girl seems older, the boy seems even younger than his age. Both are devastated, in their own ways, by the parents' separation, the father moving into a nearby apartment. The story is set in suburban Delaware, although the setting seems unimportant, is barely mentioned. The time is the 70s, during the gas shortages and long lines at service stations (hence the title). Other characters here are Gumma, the father's alcoholic mother who lives in Florida (the children fly there unaccompanied for a visit and learn to make Gumma's Margaritas and drive her golf cart); the mother's local parents, Grandmom (horrified at her daughter's 'broken home') and Grandpop (who falls asleep in his chair and belches often); Sarah, the father's new 'girlfriend;' Cliff, the mother's nice, new 'friend,' who moves in with his twelve year-old son, Marcus, who is a kind of evil Eddie Haskell type. And there is the unnamed family cat, who appears and disappears intermittently - and may symbolize something about the failing marriage and imploding family - or not.<br /><br />Their story is told in short snippets, emphasizing first one character's thoughts, then another's, with the omniscient narrator getting deep into the thoughts, hopes, fears and frustrations of each. Let me offer a few examples, pulled from the text at random. The girl -<br /><br />\"Sometimes the girl gets mad for no reason. The girl will get mad at her mother, or she'll get angry with her brother. God, can she get angry with her brother. Sometimes just the sight of him watching TV with his dopey brother face all slack and spacey, or chewing his food the way he does, his mouth agape, his fingers slick with pizza grease, is enough to set her off. It's like the girl feels a little mad about something all the time now.\"<br /><br />The father -<br /><br />\"Should the father ask the mother why she lets the boy mow the yard? Should the father offer to knock down the wasp nest growing inside the porch light fixture? Is the garage door coming off the track again? Is the woodpile in need of stacking? Is the father still the father?\"<br /><br />The mother -<br /><br />\"A problem: Cliff wants to spend the night. Solution: let Cliff spend the night on a weekend when the children are at their father's. Problem: what to do when Cliff wants to spend the night when the children are not at their father's? Solution: bill the event as a Marcus Sleepover! But will the children buy it? The mother cannot tell. She sets up Marcus in the guest bedroom, where her husband slept those last few weeks in the house. The room still holds his unhappy breath, or at least she needs to open the windows more often. There's little left of her husband in this room really \u2026\"<br /><br />The boy -<br /><br />\"The father has a hard time paying attention to the children, but the boy is only starting to catch on to that, now that he and his sister have returned from Florida. The father asks the boy questions about their trip, about Gumma, about all the things they did together, but doesn't pay attention to the boy's answers. It's sad, the way his father can't quite pay attention, the boy thinks, without the least feeling of anger. His poor dad, wanting to be nice, wanting to be a good dad, who asks his children questions, who listens, who takes time to let his children know how much they matter to him - all that.\"<br /><br />There are faint echoes of Salinger here, in the premature wisdom of the children's musings, the selfishness and floundering about by the adults. But to be honest, it seems to me that Varallo has created something entirely brand new here, in the way he tells his story of a failed marriage and a family falling apart. The account is, by turns, hilarious and heartbreaking. I laughed and chuckled, winced and frowned. It is an intimate \"between the lines\" story of a family. It is also a close look at what happens when family members fail to stay between the lines, or when they try to color outside the lines. Can you tell I'm having a hard time trying to characterize this book? Well I am. THE LINES. Hmm \u2026 You just have to READ it, okay? You will be drawn in from the first page. I was. You will NOT WANT to put it down! Did I say I loved this book? Okay. I LOVED THIS BOOK. Bravo, Mr Varallo.

Taking his inspiration from the Two Laws of Computing (\"Back it up; Do it now.\"), the author lays out principles and procedures that researchers can use to collect, analyze and store data with as few errors as possible.<br /><br />The book's first chapter describes how data is used in research and outlines the consequences of poor quality control.  Chapter Two discusses data input from a paper instrument, such as a survey, to a spreadsheet or text file.  The third chapter addresses common problems encountered when initially manipulating data.  Procedures covered include recoding, assigning variable and value labels, dealing with missing data, and merging data files.  Chapter Four teaches readers to \"debug\" their data by checking systematically for out-of-range or implausible values.  Chapter Five reviews commonly-used statistical procedures and the data requirements of each.  Finally, Chapter Six discusses organization, storage, and use of the output from statistical analysis.  This output becomes new data with its own error-checking requirements.<br /><br />The book is well organized and contains numerous examples in SAS and SPSS.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Explores human relationships under extreme circumstances", "text": "This is a fine book, carefully written, with a disturbing social commentary that underlies a narrative that is primarily about human relationships.  It would not necessarily be appropriate to classify this book as science fiction yet it is oddly futuristic and certainly is a commentary on the ability to create clones of humans and then to harvest the organs of the clones over time through a series of transplant operations.  This aspect of the story gradually reveals itself through the lives, experiences, and relationships between three young people; Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy.<br /><br />These three young people were reared in a special school that educated the clones in the arts, music, sports, and basic education. Hailsham seems to be a progressive educational institution, yet because critical information is not fully revealed to the young people at Hailsham, multiple plots and conspiracies develop in the minds of the young people. The book thus explores the social bonds and relationships that develop among parentless children.  Not having parents means that the teachers in the school, the Guardians, are the only real adult role models for the kids. Therefore the kids form cliques and groups that include or exclude others and develop a society and social structure similar to that seen in middle schools across the nation. Some kids are in and some kids are out.  Ruth is a struggler to remain always in the right crowd. Tommy is explosive and transparent and thus is usually a victim and is considered to be on the outside. Kathy is an introspective reflective loner who forms bonds with Ruth and Tommy, whom she carefully observes and understands. Eventually the characters graduate from Hailsham and move to the Cottages which appear to be for high-school and college age clones, awaiting training first as carers and then as donors. Other clones were not as lucky where little resources were expended on them and they were expected to begin making organ donations upon reaching biological adulthood.<br />The futuristic medical establishment is never revealed and the teachers for the clones and the doctors and nurses who harvest the organs never refer to the large medical infrastructure that would support such a system as this book implies.<br /><br />The book focuses more on the creation of family among those who have no family and the subtle nuances of tone, body language, choice of phrase that all imply how far we are into or out of a relationship with another. At this, the novel soars and is far more an anatomy of relationships than it was an anatomy of the body organs that these young folks eventually willingly give up as their fate in life.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Uneven but Good", "text": "Within a few pages of this David Sedaris book, I was seething with rage. \"This is about as funny as a car wreck,\" I said to myself. Although I hate to start a book and never finish reading it, I tossed this one aside in disgust, vowing never to return to its poisoned pages. Well, I did pick it up a few days later and I am glad that I did. The problem was the first few stories. The humor in the first three or four stories is juvenile and just plain dumb. It is the style of humor one finds in our middle schools. Once you get past those clunkers, the following stories and essays crackle with humor and dark emotion.<br />My favorite stories were his holiday stories, namely \"Season's Greetings,\" and \"The SantaLand Diaries (this story is why I originally wanted to buy the book).\" I don't think I really need to go into the SantaLand story since it popular enough that most people have heard of it or read it. As someone who did the retail thing, I recognize many customers and personality types in this story. I am surprised more people haven't mentioned \"Season's Greetings.\" This story is an absolute scream. It is written in the form of a Christmas card-type letter written by Jocelyn Dunbar. Poor, poor Jocelyn. Her family is sorry to announce the arrival of Khe Sahn (!), a Vietnamese strumpet who turns up on the Dunbar doorstep. Khe Sahn is the illegitimate daughter of Clifford, Jocelyn's husband, conceived during his tenure in Vietnam. I don't want to ruin the whole story for you, but I will say the way that the story is written adds greatly to the humor. The breezy, forced joviality of the letter just killed me.<br />Other stories in this collection are just as entertaining, although much darker and thoughtful. \"After Malison\" tells the story of an arrogant literary jerk and an encounter with her favorite post-modern writer. \"Don's Story\" reveals the vacuous nature of Hollywood. \"Jamboree\" is a depressing story about an unwanted child and his jerk parents. All of the stories will arouse some type of emotion in you, whether it is rage, happiness, or tears depends on the type of person you are.<br />Sedaris does have insightful perception on various aspects of society and when he is writing at top form, he shines. My advice on reading this book: expect good stories, but expect to read awhile before you get to them.", "images": [], "asin": "0316779423", "parent_asin": "0316779423", "user_id": "AEJNB2KJ7VFBSXAEZD74D5VS2M6Q", "timestamp": 1025062418000, "helpful_vote": 20, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I've used this book to zero in on ponderosa stands I haven't visited before. I wish more people would read this book so they would understand how important fire is to healthy ponderosa forests.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Pretty Close to Reality", "text": "I have become quite fond of a handful of comic strips in the daily paper. Baby Blues is one of my favorite because it strikes a recognizable chord with memories of families whose children have passed before my eyes in the classroom, not to forget in certain family situations. The Family MacPhersons as they are named, portray everyday family life, that is different vignettes, not necessarily total for any one family.<br />Mom and Dad manage these two toddlers, often being taught the ropes by these two little packages of psychological tricksters, playing against each other, and playing one parent against the other.<br />If you \"read\" this book, a \"treasury\" of comic strips over the years, you can pretty well learn from Zoe (the older sister), and her brother Hammie, how they attempt to outsmart their Mom and Dad. I particularly like the cover picture, as the reader doesn't necessarily know \"who it is that is in diapers for 10 years\". There may be an analogy of the cartoonists, Kirkman and Scott to portray the parents as close peers of the two little tricksters/manipulators, and thus the diapers for Mom and Dad, as well, as the two children trying to hold the parents at their level.<br />If you're looking for a good laugh, borrow this from your local library where this book is catalogued under the Dewey Decimal Number 741.5. You can even have \"Baby Blues\" as part of your Yahoo home page of favorites; if so, you'll get a daily snapshot of this family, without any effort. Try it; you'll laugh and cry, and remember when something touches your life. And, just in case your computer recovers from its recent crash, a book in hand will give you some laughs to cry about.

The British slang terms got a little confusing. At the beginning, they took away from the story. The further I progressed into the story, the more they were reused and I think I got a general understanding of what most of them mean. The story focuses on Jody who is in love with Jackson, the lead singer of The Regulators. There is a small problem with that. Jackson doesn't know she exists. When she gets a chance to go to a Regulator concert, she kidnaps Jackson with the help of a Curly Wurly bar. The book got a little silly at times, but in a good way. It made me chuckle quite a few times. I think the book accurately portrays withdraw and detoxing. Although, I wish the author would have given a little more detail about the process. I liked most of the characters. At first I couldn't stand Jackson. Towards the end of the book he redeems himself and becomes a cool person. My favorite character was Mac. I liked how loyal he was to Jody. Even though he could have walked away from the epic mess Jody got him into, he still helped her out. He was very passionate in everything he did. He put 100 percent into his acting and his relationships with friends and family. The book will definitely make you want to watch Rocky Horror Picture Show, whether you've seen it or not.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Not for fundamentalists", "text": "This is the book that resulted in Rushdie's having to flee a \"fatwa\" (death sentence) from the Ayatollah Khomeini. To a fundamentalist of any sort, the book is clearly anathema, for it is based on the understanding that most great religions start by reaching toward truth through myth; its subject is the intersection of myth and truth, and the different ways that good and evil can borrow one another's clothing. It is, in fact, a critique of religion -- not ultimately a negative one, but certainly one that refuses to take anything as given.<br /><br />Falling to earth after their hijacked airplane has exploded in midair, two Indian actors, the one a star in his own country, the other as Anglicized as they come, land miraculously on the English coast. One finds himself turning into the Archangel Gabriel, the other into the Devil himself. This is only the start of many miracles and transformations in a feat of linguistic legerdemain that leaps between modern London and the East in the time of the Prophet, teeming with brilliant characters, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, but all the while dealing with serious topics such as the nature of faith, national identity, and the redeeming power of love.<br /><br />Reviewing [[ASIN:B000O70PZE THE MOOR'S LAST SIGH]], I suggested that it might be modeled on Dante's INFERNO; along the same lines, this is Rushdie's PARADISE LOST. But Milton is far from the only author to whom Rushdie tips his hat in this heady book; an annotated edition might well take up a third of each page in footnotes! Some may find this infuriating; personally, I feel exhilarated -- but I have to abandon any hope of getting more than half of Rushdie's multilingual, multicultural references, as much at home in Bollywood pop as classic Persian poetry. His gift for language is quite extraordinary, whether jamming words together, exploding them, or inventing new ones with Joycean abandon.<br /><br />I must admit that the surface fascination of Rushdie's detail is such as to make it hard to read the book fast enough to get a clear sense of the direction of the whole; in both of his books that I have read, there was a difficult passage of 80 pages or so about two-thirds of the way through. But it is certainly worth perservering, for in this book especially Rushdie achieves a kind of transcendance by turning his back on his previous fireworks and ending in a style of disarming simplicity. The two final sections of the book are especially effective: a religious pilgrimage heading into a situation that can only be resolved by some kind of miracle, and an old man (not a major character, so no spoiler) dying of cancer. Simplicity as benediction; brilliance resolved as quiet beauty.<br /><br />This is a world-class author writing about major themes of immediate relevance, and not afraid to do so in a style that is a combustible mixture of high erudition and popular entertainment.

{"rating": 4, "title": "\"You are about to find out who runs this place, and it isn't you.\"", "text": "In this six-volume series set in Blackstone, New Hampshire, a \"dark figure\" has been drawn back to the long-abandoned Blackstone Asylum, which is being developed into a shopping mall.  Having found the trove of personal objects which once belonged to residents of the Asylum, the \"dark figure\" begins to wreak vengeance by distributing them throughout the town, each \"gift\" resulting in horror.  Here in Volume 4, John Saul once again uses Rebecca Morrison, the slightly handicapped survivor of a terrible accident which killed her parents, as the unwitting instrument of the horror which follows.<br /><br />(No spoilers.)  When Oliver Metcalf, editor of the local newspaper, searches through some old records in his attic, stored there because his father was the superintendent of the Asylum fifty years ago, he finds a beautiful handkerchief in the files.  Since it has the letter \"R\" on it, he decides to give it to Rebecca, her first gift in a long time.  When Germaine Wagner, the woman with whom Rebecca lives, appropriates it and gives it to her demanding, elderly mother, the stage is set for another tale of horror.<br /><br />Once again, Saul begins the story by introducing a scene of torture in the Asylum.  This time, however, he provides the name of one of the sadistic employees, making the action in this tale far more satisfying than in earlier ones because the developing horror seems directed and not simply random.  As in previous novels, Oliver Metcalf is the victim of blinding headaches, fainting spells, and visions of horror related to the Asylum, and his own background, involving the mysterious death of his twin sister at the age of four, is introduced, though he has no memory of crucial events.<br /><br />As the town begins to suspect that the \"suicides\" featured in previous novels may be connected to the Asylum, the series tension builds, not because of the gory tales but because the reasons for the horror and the choice of specific victims remain unclear.  One wonders who is the \"dark figure\" and what has made him return--and who will be the next victim, and why.<br /><br />This novel is the turning point in the series.  The \"dark figure\" hints that he is beginning to recall events and a character disappears, though there is no reason to suspect that foul play has occurred.  Though Saul develops the suspense connecting the novels slowly, it is clear that he has a grand finale planned. n  Mary Whipple", "images": [], "asin": "044922788X", "parent_asin": "044922788X", "user_id": "AHZZL323ORE6AHMIB2OCLYNCRXJQ", "timestamp": 1136837279000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Wonderful Explanation of How to Apply A Theory to A Problem", "text": "This is a unique book, and so I don't know that it will work as well for other people.  Sornette does not hesitate to use equations, including writing down differential equations and solutions.  He uses them sparingly and puts many word explanations around them, but know that if you plan to read this book Sornette is not going to skip the math.  I think he does an excellent job of explaining things without the math, but I always appreciate having the equations available.<br /><br />For the book itself, Sornette explains the theory of log-periodicity (LPPLS, log periodic power law singularity, nowadays) in the context of the stock market.  He starts with explaining the theory of randomness and the basic economics that drive stock markets and then talks about his theory of bubbles forming and how one may be able to predict them.<br /><br />I like this book a lot because it presents an idea, and could work well as an explanation of how creating a scientific model works.  The author also admits the shortcomings in the theory and offers it as one way that can sometimes be useful.  The fact that it is now about 20 years old also gives it an interesting flavor, and reading some of the cited works is worth it, as well.<br /><br />I'm not completely convinced of the log-periodicity claim, but it does seem plausible, and certainly worth exploration (it has, of course, been more explored in the intervening years), and using the theory to predict crashes and bubbles seems like it could give you some interesting insights or at least perspectives.  I'd recommend looking for some of the critiques online, though, as well.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a fan of this type of explain-your-model books.  Even if the model turns out not to be as accurate for the phenomena involved, it explains how you one can think through a problem, come up with some sort of solution, and ways to test it.  Obviously, this process can vary a lot depending on circumstances, but seeing how someone does it always fascinates me.", "images": [], "asin": "0691175950", "parent_asin": "0691175950", "user_id": "AHDB4MTGAFZQFPFUBC2GCW3H5MRA", "timestamp": 1637437670152, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Good plot, well-drawn and memorable main characters, some witty dialogs", "text": "One way to describe this thrilling, mystery-laden fantasy novel is to characterize it as an action-packed tale of aristocratic lunacies that manages to lightly touch upon serious topics such as the unjustness of women's lower standing relative to men's in a patriarchal society, the cruel treatment of the poor by the rich, and the tensions between scientific and faith-based reasoning, while still keeping it a relatively fun read for young adults.<br /><br />The novel's setting is an alternate 19th-century Ireland where the existence of non-procreating machine-animal breeds known as &#34;engimals&#34; are the subject of intense curiosity as mysterious examples of life forms that Darwin's newly expounded theory of evolution cannot account for. Somehow, these &#34;engimals&#34; have some sort of linkage to the Wildensterns whose ancestry goes several centuries back.<br /><br />Gifted with an ability to live very long lives and a physiology that helps them heal quickly, the Wildensterns are obscenely wealthy and powerful, owning properties and businesses in Ireland, Britain, and America.  Edgar, the current patriarch, has three sons designated to succeed him in the following order: Marcus, Roberto, and Nate.  As part of their upbringing, Edgar's heirs have all been taught, before the age of 16, the art of assassination and how to live by the eight &#34;Rules of Ascension&#34; which, aiming to encourage ambition and aggression, two qualities thought critical to the bloodline's continued success, make it perfectly honorable for an heir, 16 years or older, to murder a higher-ranking heir for the sole purpose of advancing one's own ranking.<br /><br />The kind of lunacy this can lead to should be predictable.  In fact, shortly after the novel's opening, readers learn that Marcus has been found dead.  Many suspect that Edgar's youngest son, Nate, having the most to gain from his eldest brother's death, may have assassinated Marcus. Just to make things even more mysterious, when centuries old Wildenstern ancestors suddenly rise from the dead, everyone is suddenly asking: Should Edgar welcome these resurrected ancestors back into the fold, and for what reasons?<br /><br />The tale initially develops at a leisurely pace in the first half of the novel, but the pace picks up significantly after that, with quite a few interesting twists and turns.  The main characters are well-drawn and memorable, and some of the dialogs are witty.  There is some violence, a bit of religious talk, and a brief scene involving a homosexual kiss. If none of these is a big concern, you may want to give this action-packed, well written young adult novel your consideration.", "images": [], "asin": "1497665701", "parent_asin": "1497665701", "user_id": "AFMSKPD5ZG6NEOIQCYATQKQQOTGQ", "timestamp": 1432004019000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "My first true experience with \"Magical Realism\"", "text": "The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender is one the most unique books I have ever read. It is also my first true experience with &#34;Magical Realism,&#34; which I have decided I quite like.<br /><br />Why? The magic is woven into the mundane so naturally that rules and explanations would ruin the effect. It just is. In this particular story, the metaphors are literal as well. I'm not sure if that is how the magic operates in this world (no explanations) or if it is common in magical realism. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the literal twist. For example, a character was so happy, he grew two inches. Normally we would read that as he stood taller, more proud. No, he literally grew two inches right there on the spot. Another character was so sad, she began disappearing within herself. She literally began disappearing, fading over time. Fantastic!<br /><br />My favorite literal metaphor/theme, was that of love birds. The Lavender family is unlucky in love. They also possess a strange and beautiful connection to birds, even becoming birds or being born with wings. This is a tale of many sorrows until the three prominent women featured learn that love can set them free from the cage they put around their life and become the wind beneath their wings--as the saying goes--enabling them to soar and experience new heights.<br /><br />The story oscillates between third person omniscient point of view (head hopping), third person intimate (from a specific character's point-of-view), and first person. It was done so seamlessly, that it rarely pulled me from the story. I love it when POV storytelling is jumbled up like this, similar to The Night Circus.<br /><br />The characters are deeply flawed. I found it was easy to sympathize and care for each one. It's through their sorrows and mistakes that the readers are able to truly appreciate how they overcame their trials to a place of inner-peace and new-found joy.<br /><br />I give The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender 4-4.25 stars. Wonderful read.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Bone Chilling Tales of the Strange", "text": "Algernon Blackwood writes some very creepy stories. Born in 1869 to a ruling class family in Kent, England, Blackwood failed to live up to the expectations of his ultra religious parents. After attending the University of Edinburgh, the young man headed to Canada, then a part of the British Empire. In Canada Blackwood failed at several different endeavors, including an attempt at journalism, running a milk farm, and managing a bar. Algernon then went to New York City where he lived in penniless isolation. It was here that the future novelist encountered the seedy side of humanity, including dangerous criminals, con men, and other assorted unsavory types. Most people, when confronted with such a bleak atmosphere, would give up in frustration. Blackwood did not; he caught a break when a wealthy individual hired him as a private secretary. His eventual return to England led to the start of his writing career, a career as the premier author of supernatural fiction.<br /><br />This compilation of Blackwood stories, compiled by E.F. Bleiler in the early 1970s, contains several of Blackwood's most lauded tales. The stories vary in length from fifty pages to less than ten pages. The title of Bleiler's collection, \"Best Ghost Stories of Algernon Blackwood,\" is more than a little misleading. There are only three stories dealing with spirits from beyond the grave here, and only one of those, \"The Listener,\" is truly creepy. The best stories in this book, without a doubt, are two of the lengthier contributions: \"The Willows\" and \"The Wendigo,\" which must rank as the eeriest stories ever written. Blackwood has the amazing ability to introduce not only deep sensations of terror, but to sustain and build that terror throughout the story. Every fan of horror must read Algernon Blackwood at some point.<br /><br />The first story, \"The Willows,\" sets the tone for the book. Two men sailing down the Danube River become trapped on an island during a flood. Immediately, strangeness rears its ugly head. The men sense that all is not right in their surroundings. Huge winds buffet the island, followed by unexplainable internal sensations of deep fear. Supplies start to disappear and the willow trees in the area seem to move of their own accord. A mysterious hole in the canoe means the men will have to stay on the island longer than planned. Blackwood never explains exactly what plagues the two travelers, but he does hint at dark forces that are attempting to force themselves into our world. This yarn ranks high on the shudder meter.<br /><br />The second story that makes this collection worth owning is \"The Wendigo.\" There are no ghosts rattling chains in this tale. Blackwood instead introduces the reader to a group of men on a hunting trip in the remoteness of backwoods Canada. Two of the men head out to a region that local Indians claim is haunted by a Wendigo, a creature who lifts men right off the ground and feeds off of them. This story is fantastic, arguably one of the best horror stories ever written. If you have ever gone out into the woods at night, far from the safety of home, you will instantly recognize the dark terror suffered by Simpson as he looks for the vanished guide Defago. I get chills just thinking about this story.<br /><br />A third story worth noting is \"The Listener,\" a ghost yarn set in a rundown house in London. A struggling writer rents a room in this old residence, but slowly realizes something is amiss in his new digs. He gets intense headaches, becomes aware of strange footsteps in the house, and notices that someone (or something) is watching him while he sleeps. There are great scenes in this story, and the final line uttered by one of this man's friends is about as unsettling as things get in this genre. For those who enjoy a great ghost story, \"The Listener\" promises to deliver the goods. Blackwood tells the story through journal entries jotted down by the protagonist, allowing the reader of the story to get a sense of passing time and increasing weirdness.<br /><br />These three stories are the best of the lot, but by no means the only effective chillers chosen for inclusion by Bleiler. For example, \"Max Hensig\" is about a murderer hunting down a journalist who had the gall to make disparaging comments about him in the city paper. There is nothing supernatural about \"Max Hensig,\" but it is a great story well worth reading. Other stories deal with nature run amuck or the appearance of devils and demons. There is something for everybody in this great book.<br /><br />Every story in the book starts the same way. One of the main characters quickly realizes that something is terribly wrong, usually through what we recognize as a \"sixth sense\" or a \"gut feeling,\" an extrasensory perception that tells us we are in big trouble. Having his characters recognize the \"wrongness\" of a situation is exactly what Blackwood set out to do. His interest was not in Wendigos or ghosts as much as it was in how man perceives these unknowns. Blackwood often ends his stories with no firm resolutions, with nothing more than speculation about what happened. This adds to the general sense of uneasiness.<br /><br />Blackwood must have influenced later writers like H.P. Lovecraft. Unfortunately, there are no clear successors to Algernon Blackwood alive today. Modern horror relies on gruesome scenes and neat plotlines that wrap up as neatly as a Christmas gift. Gore is not necessarily a bad thing, but when it is a substitute for suspense and clever writing there is a big hole that needs filling. This English author neatly closes that gap with great stories full of suspense and eeriness. More Blackwood, I say!", "images": [], "asin": "0486229777", "parent_asin": "0486229777", "user_id": "AEJNB2KJ7VFBSXAEZD74D5VS2M6Q", "timestamp": 1052963965000, "helpful_vote": 72, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I never actually read Tom Sawyer (for which, I assure you, I feel a deep sense of shame) and I still managed to fully enjoy this book.<br />Joe has returned from his years as a pirate to Missouri and, after learning that his mother is gone, decides he's going to find himself a cave to crawl in, with the intention of dying there. Along the way to finding himself a cave, he finds himself in one predicament after another, as a character created by Mark Twain is bound to do (I've read plenty of Twain, just not Tom Sawyer. I'm not a complete philistine.) He finds himself in the company of a Chinese-American named Lee, who wants to return to his home in California, and an Amish woman named Ruth, who is running away from the man her father chose for her to marry. The three of them, without a cent between them (though Joe does have two sizable diamonds left from his pirating days) decide to live and travel like hobos in order to reach Lee's destination of San Francisco. They jump trains. They ride inside them when they can and on top of them when they have to. When they aren't catching free train rides, they're accidentally getting high with a strange group of men, getting taken in by kind prostitutes, and having adventures with a wealthy man pretending to be a hobo for the fun of it.<br />A couple of times, things look really bleak for one or more of our trio but somehow they always manage to find a way out.

{"rating": 5, "title": "A Classic Story About Toys and Love", "text": "The story of a boy who receives a toy rabbit as a Christmas gift, The Velveteen Rabbit is a beloved classic by Margery Williams. I enjoyed this tale as a child and, although my reasons for enjoying it have changed, to this day I have never tired of reading it. No matter how many picture books and chapter books I outgrew and passed on in my youth, The Velveteen Rabbit is one I knew I\u2019d always keep.<br /><br />As a child, at least part of the appeal of The Velveteen Rabbit lay in its fantastical element. As its subtitle says, it\u2019s a story about how toys become real. In that way, it\u2019s akin to Pinocchio, another beloved literacy character who wanted to be more than a toy. And, in my earliest years, I wanted to believe that my toys could become real. Not that my imaginings were straightforward. Rather, they were a mix of various fantasies. There was the one where my toys would talk at night when I was asleep. Or the one where my toys could invoke revenge on me if I allowed them to get damaged. And the one where all my discarded toys would end up in the land of misfit toys. All of these jumbled in my head, along with the one about where my toys would become real because of my love. And if I were to qualify any of my toys under the latter stipulation, it would have to be a floppy gaudy green and pink plush dog. It\u2019s hair is worn bare, an eye is missing, and various appendages have been taped to hold them together. For years, I slept with that doll. Today I still have it and it serves as my gravatar.<br /><br />Eventually, I outgrew my belief that toys could become real. Then the appeal of The Velveteen Rabbit lay solely in its message about love: \u201cIt takes a long time. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don\u2019t matter at all, because once you are Real you can\u2019t be ugly, except to people who don\u2019t understand.\u201d In Christian circles, the Skin Horse\u2019s advice can be used to explain to new converts how we start out as babes in Christ but through trials and tribulations become mature adults. Amongst friends, the advice can be used to explain why differences and disagreements are to be expected. As much as we might dislike it at the time, it\u2019s only those individuals who love every good and bad part of us who will become our best friends. In every relationship, the Skin Horse\u2019s advice can be applied. Back in our dating years, my husband and I used to quote the Skin Horse\u2019s various lines about being real as a sentimental but profoundly true way of expressing what growing old together would mean.<br /><br />While rereading The Velveteen Rabbit this past weekend, I felt struck by a couple of critical questions. Barely two pages in, Williams rambles about how the mechanical toys felt superior to the others. They apparently had modern ideas. A jointed lion even pretended he was connected with the Government. I don\u2019t know what I thought of these lines as a child, but now I\u2019m sure that I completely understand them. Then there was the fact that after the boy got sick with the scarlet fever, all the toys in the nursery were to be thrown away. Immediately I wondered whatever happened to the Skin Horse? Yet these two questions didn\u2019t diminish my enjoyment of The Velveteen Rabbit. As Williams rambled on about the expensive toys snubbed by our hero, I felt mostly empathy for how insignificant and commonplace the Velveteen Rabbit felt. With regards to the Skin Horse, I can only surmise that either he escaped the fate of being tossed or he too experienced a visit from the nursery magic fairy. Only we just hear of her visit to Velveteen Rabbit, because the book is about our hero.<br /><br />The Velveteen Rabbit has been around since 1922. Since that time, it has remained a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children\u2019s theater as well as on radio, television, and the big screen. Every generation will have a chance to experience its beauty in one form or another.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Some helpful things, a lot of fluff", "text": "This is a self-help series that might help you or someone you know, but it takes a long time to get to the point.  It would have been better as a book, a short book.<br /><br />What you get are 6 audio CDs and a DVD, plus a writeable \"work disc\" DVD.  The six audio CDs focus on things like taking a deep breath to \"reboot\", changing your perspective by going to higher ground, and (probably most importantly) visualizing your success before you actually undertake whatever you are trying to succeed at.  There are subsections on health, business, and family.  The DVD contains what seems like a long commercial for the series, plus an auditorium speech by the author, covering much of the same ground as the audio CDs.<br /><br />What I found frustrating was that there was a lot of time wasted here.  There's some \"uplifting music\" which goes on too long and is repeated throughout the audio CD series.  Then there are many moments where the author asks you to take 90 seconds to relax, breathe, and visualize something.. followed by 90 seconds of blank space on the CD.  I found myself fast forwarding a lot.<br /><br />The author also likes to name drop a lot, especially Alex Rodriguez whom the author claims to have coached with his outlook.  I'm a big fan of A-Rod (who isn't?) as he's not only been a hugely successful baseball player, but he's a great commentator, successful business guy, seems like a positive and thoughtful person.  I don't doubt that A-Rod sought out anything he thought could help him, anywhere he could get it, but I doubt that much of A-Rod's success is related to this \"90 second rule\" approach.  I will say that A-Rod improved his post-season play during his career, so if Fannin's coaching helped with that, it was time well spent.<br /><br />And one part I found borderline offensive was when the author implied he could beat cancer by thinking positive thoughts.  Now I don't doubt that a positive attitude is helpful to one's health, but if you have skin cancer you need surgery (I've had it myself), you can't expect to just \"will\" it away.  A positive mental attitude only takes you so far, and if it could take you to full health then we'd need only faith healers instead of qualified physicians.<br /><br />So \"90 Second Rule\" goes with the other self-help programs that seem to promise much, and deliver - something, but probably not as much as you'd hoped.  I'd put this about on a par with Tony Robbins, but I don't think much of Tony Robbins (yes I realize that he has fans).

{"rating": 5, "title": "A great book that I wish was just a little better", "text": "&quot;Dr. Mardy&quot; Grothe is a retired clinical psychologist (thus the &quot;Dr.&quot;), management consultant, and speaker. But he is far from being retired as a quotation maven. In fact, this collection of quotations is his seventh word and language book, and provides a window into his on-line collection of metaphorical quotations that has already become the world's largest.<br /><br />Not only does Dr. Mardy collect quotations, drawing on hundreds of volumes in his personal library, but he verifies them. That verification is priceless -- I see so many nonfiction books that contain unverified quotations it makes me tear out my hair in frustration. &quot;No, Mark Twain didn't say that!&quot; &quot;No, Albert Einstein said nothing like that!&quot; &quot;Nice words, but it wasn't Carl Sagan who said them!&quot; Just to give three examples that I saw in business books the last couple of days.<br /><br />As Dr. Mardy explains in the text beginning this book, here he moves from being a quotation anthologist to being a quotation curator. He selects the ten best quotations in his on-line collection in 250 categories and presents them here. You thus get 2,500 quotations presented by topic collected and selected by a qualified curator. Not only do you get the quotations themselves, but you can get more quotations by scanning a QR code for each topic into your smartphone to take you to that topic on Dr. Mardy's on-line collection.<br /><br />That's what I liked about the book. Now here's what I don't like as much (though I still do recommend the book for any reader).<br /><br />First, the book is squat and fat. All told it is almost 500 pages, making it two inches thick (most books are one). While most books have pages that are about 9 inches by 6 inches, this book has pages that are about 7 inches by 5 inches. That may not sound like a big difference, but I was surprised to find how that made me less likely to carry the book around and dip into it. And since this is not the kind of book that makes good reading from cover to cover (for me it gets tiring to read quotations straight for more than about 10 minutes), that means I rarely read it.<br /><br />Second, I don't like how the quotations look on the page. They are in bold type, centered, with the author's name to the right and below in all capital letters. Most of the page is blank space -- over 90%. Obviously, some people like this look, or they wouldn't have done the book this way. And Dr. Mardy changed his weekly newsletter to this format too. (Sign up for that newsletter -- I've read it for more than 10 years, and it's a great thing to look forward to on Saturday nights.) But the format bothers me.<br /><br />Third, I wish each quotation gave the source of the quotation and the date. That information is in the on-line database, so it is available. But why not have it here in the book? I always want to know that kind of thing for every quotation, and not having it in the book where there is plenty of space for it irks me every time I read it.<br /><br />Fourth, and more philosophically, is a collection this big and (largely) unannotated all that helpful? Aren't quotations out of context and with no explanation a little like tweets on Twitter? Good for casual browsing, but often more thoughtless than thoughtful?<br /><br />Take one example that caught my eye -- a quotation from Sherry Turkle on computers (on page 82). It's an interesting quotation that I have seen before. (I've read all of Sherry Turkle's books.) But here it lacks the last line that almost always appears (and that appears in the on-line Dr. Mardy dictionary), and it lacks all context.<br /><br />If you check out that quotation, it comes from Sherry Turkle's 1984 book [[ASIN:0671468480 The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit]]. When that was written, there was no Internet, just the Arpanet. Computers were rather primitive and were often used most by &quot;hackers,&quot; who were different from modern-day hackers. She was referring in that phrase to how those hackers suffered from a modern neurosis. Without that context, and without knowing how her views have evolved along with computer technology, the quotation can easily be misinterpreted.<br /><br />I've gone on at length when I meant to be brief. So let me just end with a recommendation to buy this book, subscribe to Dr. Mardy's newsletter, and visit his on-line dictionary. (Unless you are one of those people who don't care about quality quotations. Then go to Goodreads, BrainyQuotes, or some other site on the Internet to get your inspiration, and miss out on the good stuff.)", "images": [], "asin": "0062445332", "parent_asin": "0062445332", "user_id": "AGT4S5Q7PPN6FST33GVNUVY5ZGCQ", "timestamp": 1486959787000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Many would be offended by this book and its implicit rejection of certain religious beliefs. Others will simply be unable to comprehend the core concepts: conscious intelligence as a non-cellular being. A conscious being that is a machine. Human Level Artificial Intelligence. Machines that not only think, but are consciously aware and capable of what we consider \"thought\", but are not alive in the sense we understand the word.<br /><br /> BINA48 is the largely rudimentary clone of Rothblatt's real-life wife. \"Scientists, innovators, doctors, programmers and dreamers know that human consciousness is not limited to brain of cerebral neurons. IT is rapidly closing in on creating humanlike consciousness simply because of what we know about how the brain works: it isn't necessary to \"copy\" every function of the human brain in order to generate thought, intelligence and awareness\".  One example: IBM's Watson which won a \"Jeopardy\" contest against the best two human competitors.<br /><br /> Stop and ponder for a moment, as the author does. At one time, the fruit on a tree may have been beyond the grasp of our ancestors - so the brain came up with a solution. Use a stick to shake the fruit loose from the tree. Shake the tree. Throw stones. And some millions of years later (or so) you hold access to millions of pages of information in your hand in the form of a device that communicates wirelessly at the speed of light.<br /><br /> Rothblatt wants us to consider going where few other minds have gone before.<br /><br /> This is a challenging book, one to be read in leisure, with many pauses to reflect on what she has to say. The consciousness of a beloved grandparent living on and even growing forever. Or the evil mind of a tyrant able to rule for eons, a frequent topic of post-World War II comic books.<br /><br /> Mindclones, Rothblatt calls them. And she brings to mind many considerations, legal, ethical, scientific that we have not had to consider with reasoning, conscious machines.<br /><br /> Heavy stuff to be sure, but taken in small doses, very thought-provoking. I happen to be in the same camp as Rothblatt, Kurzweil and others: soon minds will exist without bodies.<br /><br />Jerry", "images": [], "asin": "1250046637", "parent_asin": "1250046637", "user_id": "AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA", "timestamp": 1412307908000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 4, "title": "Almost the Anne Rice of Old", "text": "The last Anne Rice novel I read was her final novel featuring the brat prince Lestat, Blood Canticle.  But that novel ended on a note of frustration that I felt did a disservice to the chracter, but as they say that then and this is now.  For the most part I really enjoyed Wolf Gift.  It doesn't quite rise to the level of the Vampire Chronicles, but then will Anne Rice ever rise to that level again and does she really need to?<br /><br />Wolf Gift is still in the supernatural realm that Anne Rice does so well but with a twist and a little of the post-Lestat Anne thrown in for good measure.  Wolf Gift is not your typical werewolf story, but that's what makes it so interesting.  I quite enjoyed getting to know the protagonist Reuben and was really surprised when the story took a very superhero-like turn as Reuben struggles with his new \"gift\" and what he wants to do with it.  In fact, I found some of the vigilante action scenes to be a fun change of pace from what we normally expect from Anne Rice.<br /><br />If I had to pick a fault, and it's really why I coldn't give Wolf Gift five stars, it's the lackluster finale of the story.  Here we have a return of the Anne Rice who could get a little too preachy with her ruminations on good versus evil.  Still, for any Anne Rice fan Wolf Gift is a nice return to what made her a bestselling author.  Even more importantly, I hope we will see more of this new world she's created.", "images": [], "asin": "0307595110", "parent_asin": "0307595110", "user_id": "AH5J5CUKSVSZEJ5KKP62RJDHSOMQ", "timestamp": 1329075468000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "It's easy cooking greens (apologies to Kermit :-)", "text": "One of my favorite things to buy every week is organic kale and mustard greens, but other than my standby recipe for kale chips or using it in soups, I wasn't really sure how to show it off to its best advantage. Enter Nava Atlas's \"Wild About Greens,\" which will give you 125 vegan recipes for kale, collards, mustard greens, and more.<br /><br />The journey begins with a brief guide to preparation and an illustrated who's who of greens, from common varieties (spinach, kale, chard), to those I'd looked at but didn't know how to prepare (including  Asian greens such as tatsoi and mizuna, beet greens, dandelion greens, turnip and radish greens). Thanks to Nava, I learned that you can freeze greens by blanching them and putting them into freezer bags (before, I had the bad habit of leaving them in the fridge until the end of the week when they were past their prime).<br /><br />Chapter 1 appropriately starts with basic preparations, including saut\u00e9s, braising, and stir-fries. I particularly enjoyed the Mediterranean greens with pine nuts and raisins and the chard with raisins and pecans from this chapter. Subsequent chapters focus on heartier combinations of greens and grains and/or beans, including pasta with two beans and escarole, rosemary potatoes and collard greens with vegan sausage, and ragout of broccoli rabe with white beans and porcini mushrooms.<br /><br />I was first introduced to massaged kale salads in Nava's [[ASIN:1402780052 Vegan Holiday Kitchen: More than 200 Delicious, Festive Recipes for Special Occasions]] so I was happy to see a wider variety here, including kale salad with fresh fruit and radicchio and Asian-flavored kale and napa cabbage salad. You'll find a large variety of soups utilizing greens, including the wonderful Italian-style potato and escarole soup (I added sun-dried tomatoes that I had on hand, and it really added an extra layer of texture and flavor). Finally, the recipes are rounded out by a juicing primer and such unusual flavors as beets and greens juice with apples and ginger, sparkling spinach juice, and several greens-based smoothies: spinach and mango smoothie, nutty chocolate-banana and spinach smoothie, and kale and pear smoothie.<br /><br />One small note: the text color on some of the sections is very light and there is little contrast against the background, making these recipes difficult to read from a distance. Also, there are relatively few photos if you're one of those who likes to see photos for each recipe. And finally, no nutritional info is given, which would have been appreciated.<br /><br />Verdict: \"Wild About Greens\" is a great way to make the most of bountiful seasonal/regional greens and is sure to expand your recipe repertoire. There's enough variety that you can easily cook through several weeks of recipes without a repeat, and you'll find various international influences (Italian, Asian, Mexican) to boot. This is a great primer for CSA members or anyone looking to eat more healthfully.<br /><br />(Thanks to Nava Atlas for the review copy!)", "images": [], "asin": "1402785887", "parent_asin": "1402785887", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1345113565000, "helpful_vote": 35, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "He's not a writer, and this book isn't for you", "text": "Two caveats up front. First off, Anthony Bourdain is not a writer. His prose is basic-to-mediocre, and the text is riddled with typos (although that's as much on the editors as Mr. Bourdain). The second caveat is that this book is unapologetically not for the mass public. Bourdain's real aim in writing was to be authentic to who he is as a cook, communicating with other cooks in language only they will truly understand, although along the way he tosses out some bread crumbs for the lay person. Given these starting points, this is one of the better books I've read in my life.<br /><br />Bourdain is, using the oft-repeated mantra, the Hunter S. Thompson of the cooking world. This is the gonzo journalism of the cooking industry. He's an awful person, and you can tell you'd hate working anywhere near the guy. He's crass, he's foul-mouthed, he tries to sneak in big words to look smart. You will actually hate this guy sometimes, and you'll also likely want to stay away from the restaraunts he's decribing. But then you realize. Bourdain's power as a writer lies in stirring your feelings. You feel revulsion at his life, because he tells the story with painful truth. You hate the man, because he does a very good job communicating what horrible things he's seen and done. You become squeamish about restaraunts, because you can tell the horrors are all too real.<br /><br />And yes, there's a lot of horrors found in this text. People having sex in back rooms, snorting cocain off the bar, shoveling \"unused\" bread from one table to the next, and why the Monday fish special is usually a bad idea. This is the truth of the cooking industry, warts and all.<br /><br />Or is it? As many have said, there's a big asterisk on the whole book, partially thanks to the updated edition. Bourdain has recanted a lot of the subservion found in the book. In fact, partly because of this book, you're less likely than most any point in history to be serviced by any kitchen where waiters are spitting in your food or cutting dangerous corners maximizing profit. There's more scrutiny than ever on the cooking industry, and a lot more money flowing, causing standards in today's kitchens to be much higher than at the time of writing.<br /><br />Kitchen Confidential, in some ways, is to the kitchen industry what Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" was to the meat-packing industry. The more terrifying parts of the book are now relics of a bygone era. You might say that this is what the restaraunt industry was, not necessarily what it is. And that's okay.<br /><br />So much like the works of Hunter S. Thompson or Chuck Palahniuk, this book makes you feel. Bourdain's crass writing accomplishes this goal in spades. The additional commentary from Bourdain that the new edition contains will also tell you that Kitchen Confidentail massively surpassed Bourtain's expectations in terms of being true to the cooking world and \"telling it like it is\". Will you like this book? I can't tell you that. You might hate this book. You might ignore every word, toss this paperback in the garbage, and return to restaraunt dining with nary a care in the world. Regardless, you have to admit that this book does exactly what the author intended.<br /><br />Recommended enthusiastically to anyone who has ever eaten food.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Blue Mustangs, Red Corvettes, and a Whole New Type of Fiction  --", "text": "In the late 1960's a new type of American literature evolved, one that spoke straight to the social and economic needs of teens and bypassed the sentimental, boy-meets-girl fiction that had largely been the norm before. THE OUTSIDERS (1967) by a new teen author, S.E. Hinton, set the outlook and established the genre. \"Young Adult\" fiction, as the new writing came to be called, was a hit with adolescents and sympathizers alike.<br /><br />The novel is set in a medium-sized Oklahoma city and narrated by \"Ponyboy\" Curtis who, along with his two older brothers, was left to fend for himself when their parents died in a car wreck. After that, material privation is only part of the challenges the brothers face. The town is divided along class lines: on the East Side live working-class \"Ponyboy,\" his family and friends, the so-called \"Greasers\"; to the West are the middle-class \"Socs,\" the better-off but not necessarily \"rich\" kids. These two mega-gangs have their own different styles, which author Hinton limns out in great detail: social interaction (Soc understatement versus Greaser passion), transportation (newer Detroit cars versus walking, or beaters), clothes (wheat jeans and Madras plaid versus t-shirts and leather), and of course music (the Beatles versus Elvis -- after all, this was 1967).<br /><br />After a long-anticipated rumble pits Greasers against Socs, Ponyboy and friends decide it's best to go into hiding in another town. But what should have been prudent develops along unanticipated and tragic lines, which I can't go into here. I can say, though, that THE OUTSIDERS put S.E. Hinton at the top of her game, gave legs to a powerful new force in fiction, and even triggered a spate of highly successful movies, not least of them the eponymous feature film (1983) starring Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise. Even if \"teen angst\" is but a long-vanished memory for most of us, THE OUTSIDERS and its ilk are well worth discovering.", "images": [], "asin": "014240733X", "parent_asin": "014240733X", "user_id": "AH4CDXZ2CADQZEXGVINPIPSBRQ4Q", "timestamp": 1625855231517, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Dark and intense, but engrossing", "text": "&#34;We know only enough of our own cells to know they speak a language we can't hear. How our atoms slacken and slide out of tune. How they slip past one another, the slightest of friction. How they whisper insurrection. How they articulate in flame what we leave behind.&#34;<br /><br />This book was dark. Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down is about a high school in St. Louis dealing with the ramifications of a school shooting that took 28 students from them, and the impossible task that four students face in creating a yearbook that no one is going to want to read. In the wake of this disaster, the town's grief is only piled upon when the houses of the families who lost a child begin to burn to the ground. It's a &#34;story of grief, community, and family, of the search for understanding and normalcy in the wake of devastating loss, Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down explore profound questions about resiliency, memory, and recovery that brilliantly illuminate the deepest recesses of the human heart.&#34;<br /><br />That last bit makes this book sound very intense, and let me tell you it lives up to every ounce of that. There was no reprieve, no respite from the grief, from the darkness, from the fear and anxiety and tragedy that pervades every page of this book. I would be hard pressed to believe that the author, Anne Valente, had not experienced loss and tragedy of her own. She knows too intimately the feeling of it, the way it colors everything, the atmosphere it creates. She does a superb job of communicating that feeling to the reader, of putting them right in the thick of it, of using words to communicate far more than words seem they could.<br /><br />I was waiting through the whole book for a glimmer of hope; for resolution that I'm sad to say never came. Though the ending was surprising and befitting of the title, I had wished for more closure. I suppose that wishing for that is fitting and adds another layer to the reading experience. And it is just that, an experience. Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down keeps you turning pages. I don't know if it is just our own curiosity, sick as it is, to get into the minds of shooters and arsonists, but we always need to know why and I think that is the main driving force behind our need to keep reading. Very well executed, in every sense. Even down to the last two pages, which were filled with poetic introspection and comments about the human condition, which I always appreciate.<br /><br />p.s.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Through the course of the novel they meet others like themselves and try to figure out who they are", "text": "Icons by Margaret Stohl is set in a world run by aliens that have dominated humans. The majority of human race was eliminated and the remaining people are enslaved. The main character Dol and her childhood companion Ro are special in some way unknown precisely to them. Through the course of the novel they meet others like themselves and try to figure out who they are. This is of course with the backdrop of a rebellion to overthrow the alien overlords.<br /><br />This novel keeps the listeners attention and is filled with action. The characters continue to move and face more challenges as they try to figure out what is actually going on around them. My favorite characters in this novel were actually Doc and Fortis even though they are not the main characters. Doc is especially well done because of the computerized tone of his voice. The logic based speech added a lot of humor to the story.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this novel is how it is arranged. Between the main chapters of the story told from the perspective of Dol runs a third person reading of documents. These in-between readings provide the listener with clues about the story and add another layer of information. This is great because the main characters of the story are mostly unknowledgeable. With these in between readings, the listener can couple what the characters are doing and their knowledge with this additional insight. It helps the listener make their own conclusions about the events and the world.<br /><br />What I actually found to be annoying was that this is a young adult novel in which the characters are not only young as expected but also na\u00efve and behave as such. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to understand the main characters\u2019 feelings and actions. There are some incongruous aspects when characters suddenly seem to change the way they are. I didn\u2019t feel like this about the other characters.<br /><br />I believe the narrator, Therese Plummer, did a great job with the voice of the different characters. They were clearly different. I did find the main character\u2019s voice to be annoying, but I can\u2019t tell if that is because of the main character or the narrator. The emotion that Dol embodies may be the cause of my irritation toward her voice. I though the rest were great. The production was well done, especially Doc\u2019s voice the in-between readings were great.<br /><br />Audiobook provided for review by the publisher.<br /><br />Please find this complete review and many others at audiobookreviewer dot com<br /><br />[If this review helped, please press YES.

This guide shows readers how to clean out a garage and actually use it as a functional space (and even make room to park a car in it! Imagine that?

By thinking ahead of time on what you envision the end project to look like (and how you want to use the space) will help keep the project on track during the clean up period.

{"rating": 5, "title": "So scary, it's unreal", "text": "According to Williams and his reading of his sources Al Qaeda already has the bomb, many times over.  Bin Laden purchased the nukes from Chechen rebels who stole/bought them from disgruntled former Soviet scientists.  Bin Laden also purchased some of the scientists and technicians themselves to keep the bombs in working order.  Furthermore, bin Laden bought fissionable material on the black market and has the ability to turn that material into his own homemade bombs.  He hired some nuclear scientists to help out.  He got the money to pay for this from running the heroin trade out of Afghanistan.<br /><br />The question immediate arises, why hasn't he used the nukes yet?  The answer, according to Williams, is that bin Laden is a very, very careful man with enormous patience who, having spent all that dough, is not about to blow his opportunity to kill four million Americans through doing anything hasty like getting the bombs stopped at the border, or having them inoperative when he pulls the trigger.  The grand plan is to get the nukes into the US and plant them at say seven different locations, including probably New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston, Los Angeles, etc., make his usual pious announcement that it is time for the US to exit all Muslim lands and accept the will of Allah, etc.  And when the US does not, he pulls the trigger, morally secure in the knowledge that he warned us.<br /><br />But there is more.  Williams claims that during the Cold War the former Soviet Union planted suitcase-sized nuclear bombs in many places throughout the United States, and those bombs are still there.  Possibly bin Laden has purchased knowledge of their location and how to work them from former Soviet scientists and military operatives.<br /><br />Williams wrings his hands and wants to know, since this is all public knowledge (he cites the sources on page after page), why the mass media hasn't informed the American public about the impending apocalypse.<br /><br />I don't believe the sky is falling.  I seldom subscribe to conspiracy theories, but I want to be candid here.  I've been reading on his subject for a few years now, and like Williams I can see that the information and the cold logic is out there.  You just have to go after it since the major media don't feel it's in the best interest of their bottom line to make a big deal of something so horrific as a possible nuclear attack on the United States--especially considering that nobody, but nobody knows how to do anything about it.<br /><br />Certainly not the Bush administration, which is decidedly NOT addressing the subject in public.  They cannot for fear of causing a panic.  Think what would happen to the stock market if the Bush administration admitted that an unpreventable nuclear attack on US was likely and imminent.<br /><br />Personally I used to live in the Los Angeles area.  I moved not long ago.  The Long Beach-Los Angeles harbor is the biggest port of entry for cargo containers in the United States.  Of the millions that come into the port every year only about three percent are inspected.  I didn't like the odds.<br /><br />I would also like to point out first the obvious that the Bush administration has not gotten bin Laden and that we have no deterrent against him.  We could blow up Pakistan (where he is presumably hiding) but we might never know if we got him or not.  Furthermore, he doesn't care.  The thrill of killing four million Americans (Al Qaeda's stated goal \"justified\" by how many Muslims America has supposedly killed) clearly would outweigh his fear of death.<br /><br />Second, note that the people who mailed the anthrax letters a month after the World Trade Towers went down have never been apprehended or even identified.  But if you read the media closely, it is clear that the most likely suspect is not a disgruntled or deranged government employee but instead the very same Al Qaeda that conducted the September 11th massacre.  Williams notes that Al Qaeda has anthrax and other biochemical agents.<br /><br />I mention this because the reason that the Bush administration and the mass media no longer mention the anthrax mailings is the same reason they don't talk about the missing Soviet nukes and the likelihood of where they are, namely because to speak truthfully about these things is to spread fear and panic among the general public and to admit to an inability to do anything about it.  This is the reason we are facing these horrendous threats in silence<br /><br />Amazing, you say?  It is.  And it is as crazy or even crazier than the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) that prevailed during the Cold War, and, by the way, still prevails to some extent today.<br /><br />Bottom line is that some humans will murder one another in an attempt to get what they want.  They will wantonly kill one another in the name of God or because of hate or prejudice.  And with nuclear weapons now over-the-counter items, they will do so in massive numbers, and again, guess what?  Until we change human nature or find a way to actually prevent (make physically impossible) its use, the mushroom cloud will once again envelope a human city, and probably in the near future.  And that city will be an American city.<br /><br />Count on it, is what Williams is telling us.  He cites sources throughout and fills his narrative with the most compellingly veracious-sounding detail that I am fairly crying out for somebody to demonstrate, item by item, that he is in error.  I wish I could.  The truth is, I think he's right.<br /><br />Read this book at your peril.  It might give you nightmares.  It might bring on clinical depression.

Charlie has been contacted by his old friend Elliot Norton and asked to come to South Carolina to help clear a young man of a murder charge. After he arrives, he helps to transport the young man to a safe house, but just as Charlie starts to investigate the young man is murdered. Parker knows there is more to this than meets the eye. His investigation will take him back into the past of two families, one black and one white and uncover a horrifying crime. Meanwhile, back in Maine, Rev. Faulkner is trying to orchestrate his release from prison but Lewis and Angel have other plans.<br /><br />This is another hit for me and bonus points because there are no spiders. I continue to love the whole cast of characters and I like that the characters\u2019 stories carry over from one book to the next. Angel is still struggling to overcome the trauma Rev. Faulkner inflicted on him. We get to learn a little more about Lewis\u2019s history, and the relationship between Charlie and Rachel continues to develop.

Andrew and Abby Borden were both brutally murdered in their home with an axe; Andrew\u2019s daughter Lizzie was arrested and brought to trial for their murders. She was found not guilty and the murders are still unsolved today. Sarah Schmidt took a 10 year writing process/obsession and has brought us the fictional account of what led to the murders and afterwards with See What I Have Done.<br /><br />There are four narrators in See: Lizzie, her sister Emma, Bridget the maid, and the enigmatic Benjamin who is a fictional character. Each narrator brings something different to this very disturbing story and family. It is a slow moving novel that at times can be hard to follow with the narratives. See goes back and forth within the chapters which can be confusing.  I had to reread some paragraphs several times because of the confusion.<br /><br />There is a timeline included at the end of the novel. I felt that would have been better used at the beginning as an introduction to see where things will go for those who don\u2019t know many details about the case. I felt a \u201ccast of characters\u201d would have been helpful as Schmidt seems to assume that the reader will know who each character is.<br /><br />Even knowing this novel is fictional, it all seemed very real.  This comes with the in-depth research that Schmidt did. It does make you think about the case and wonder what really happened.  If you are looking for a good fictional introduction to Lizzie Borden, this is the place to start. If you are looking for anything \u2018new\u2019 with the case or any conclusions as to who did commit the murders, you will not get that.<br /><br />Despite the issues I had, Schimidt did a very good job with See, which is her debut novel and it is an accomplishment. Living and breathing Lizzie for 10 years must have affected her as she \u2018lived\u2019 with these real people for so long.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Passionately Argued Polemic That Neglects the Humanities Somewhat", "text": "Salman Khan&#34;s book has achieved considerable success in its description of the creation of the Khan Academy, giving generations of learners worldwide the opportunity to become responsible for their own learning by accessing a range of videos through YouTube on a variety of subjects - science, math, chemistry, etc. - and using the feedback software created by the author with sponsorship support from luminaries such as Bill Gates and Google.<br /><br />While Khan is to be congratulated on his pioneering efforts, it has to be said that his book does contain certain flaws.  His criticism, of the modern education system is based on assumptions expressed by many radical educational theorists of the past: the system, created in the Victorian era, was designed to produce generations of learners equipped for manual work.  Now it seems outmoded, with learners forced a lot of the time to memorize material that they will almost instantly forget.  Khan is also good at pointing out the shortcomings of the exam system that benefits those with highly developed short-term memories rather than those with genuine enthusiasm for their subjects.  He favors instead a more individualized system: through the internet, with help from mentors, learners can go at their own pace and make their own judgments as to their educational progress.<br /><br />The basic framework of his book is a good one: schools should avoid rigid subject specialization and concentrate instead on whole-person activities designed to foster a learning environment.  Yet Khan's grasp of how this might be achieved in the humanities is often tenuous.  He argues with justification that learners need to be encouraged to want to read the classics, rather than having them forced down their throats during English lessons; but quite how this could be done through online methods is never wholly explained.  Moreover Khan neglects the power of face-to-face contact; however much we may need technology to conduct research in today's world, we need to understand something about the ways in which people think and react paralinguistically.  This can only be achieved through direct interaction.  I am not suggesting that online methods of education using new technologies are not good - I happen to think that they can promote the kind of direct communication often absent in the ordinary classroom.  On the other hand, I think learners and educators still need to collaborate directly so as to refine their methods of working online.  Don't throw the baby out with the bath-water, so to speak.<br /><br />THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE is a passionate work, the product of a highly intelligent mind that has applied itself to a social mission, even though it depends on capitalist investment.  On the other hand, I think that some of its arguments need to be approached from a more transdisciplinary angle, so as to encompass the humanities as well as the sciences.  The humanities might not be so 'productive' in terms of creating future generations of job-ready graduates, but they occupy an important position in the curriculum nonetheless.", "images": [], "asin": "1455508373", "parent_asin": "1455508373", "user_id": "AEJMZWFQBPXWVDXHJ7RSDRY3XOCA", "timestamp": 1438441845000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Our Story", "text": "Diana Butler Bass does a fine job of writing a history of Christianity in the vein of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States. Instead of focusing on what Butler Bass calls \"Big-C Christianity: Christ, Constantine, Christendom, Calvin, and Christian America,\" she unfolds the history of the faith through the stories of the little people and the grassroots movements. This provides for a fascinating and extremely refreshing understanding of our past and an illumination of the effects it has had upon our present and possibly our future.<br /><br />This is the other side of Christian history, or as Paul Harvey might have said, the rest of the story. There are great lessons and cautionary tales herein concerning what it means to radically follow Jesus Christ, especially in the face of opposition from the powers that be, both pagan and hierarchical. Butler Bass provides a cool drink of water for many of us who have found that power, prosperity and aggression are not necessarily signs of God's grace and favor, in other words, those who oppose the current captivity of the church by American Cultural Religion and the exportation of that demonic malformation to the rest of our planet.<br /><br />A People's History is a salve for the hurting. Well written, innovative, redemptive, open and honest; the story of God's people rather than the hierarchy's Towers of Babel. I particularly appreciate how Butler Bass tells our story from the perspective of Jesus, ethics and devotion rather than from the perspective of power, dogma and conquest.<br /><br />\"More than anything else,\" says Butler Bass, \"Christianity is a love song.\" That is so evident in her lyrical look at the story. Our story. The story of the \"Generative Christians\" who live a faith that births new possibilities of God's love into the world; transformative rather than hierarchical, formative instead of triumphant, gracious rather than merely victorious. This is a book that has found a permanent place on my bookshelf from whence it shall be often retrieved. I highly recommend it to everyone, and particularly to those who follow Christ.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Back In The Saddle", "text": "Old Boys continues the saga of Paul Christopher and his enigmatic but always engaging clan. Paul is a member of \"The Outfit\", i.e. a CIA agent, who has led a very active and fascinating life, all chronicled in the earlier entries of this \"series\". McCarry's books are reminiscent of LeCarre's and also John Lawton's, with more mind-games than gun-play, and with complicated international historical puzzles to be pieced together rather than \"cases\" to be solved. Hopefully without sounding condescending, if you like \"intellectual espionage thrillers\" as opposed to \"adrenaline powered\" ones, I highly recommend Charles McCarry.<br /><br />That said Old Boys is a little different than its predecessors. Although the now aged Paul Christopher plays a critical role - he goes missing - the story's narrator and protagonist is his also aged cousin, Horace Hubbard. Horace was a central character in Shelley's Heart - which I am going to have to re-read - and is now \"retired\" and well - \"disgraced\".  And as a story-teller Horace more than a little resembles Nelson DeMille's character - John Corey.<br /><br />Now a quick word on the plot - Within the first 30 pages of the book, the author sets up a conundrum involving Paul's disappearance, the Christopher family tree, the roots of Christianity, Nazi Germany including Reinhard Heydrich, Islamic terrorism and the possible destruction of the world as we know it.  Horace pulls together a team of \"Old Boys\" from The Outfit to tackle the job and find his cousin. If that sounds a little crazy, it is. So the reader needs, at least to a minor extent, to suspend some disbelief in order to enjoy this ride. If that's too much to ask, then don't bother picking up Old Boys. If you can, you're in for a wildly entertaining story as Horace and his senior citizen buddies return to the spy-world, travel the globe, utilize old connections - and of course save the world.<br /><br />Old Boys isn't farce or comedy, but at times gets real close to being such, so depending on your \"attitude\" - you'll either chuckle along or groan.<br /><br />The \"puzzle\" here is just as complicated as those in the previous books; tying together the past and the present, which all has an effect on the future. The \"Old Boys\" with their aches and pains - but most importantly their experience - are an engaging cast of characters. The reader meets - again - Paul Christopher's mother and is also introduced to his daughter - a force in her own right - and an ex-wife, who is good for a few laughs. Old Boys is much lighter in tone than McCarry's earlier books, but I still found it a highly entertaining adventure story..", "images": [], "asin": "1585675458", "parent_asin": "1585675458", "user_id": "AFGEL7XKPUAHC4TE4DUYL4D5XLUQ", "timestamp": 1314720688000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "The courage to remain separate, to think through to the truth is the Power of One", "text": "This is an outstanding epic South African coming of age novel told in the first person by a young English (Rooineks) fatherless lad of five who names himself Peekay. When we first meet up with him just before WWII he is being raised by a Zulu wet nurse because his mother has had a nervous breakdown. Sent to a Boarding School full mostly Boar children (Afrikaners) Peekay learns that he is \"wicked\" and is tried and  tormented by a gang lead by one 12 year old Peekay calls \"the judge\".  The judge comes to symbolize the intolerance of apartheid and the conservative nationalists who implement their anti-black racial polices. Lines like, \"The photograph captures the exact moment when understood with conviction that racism is a primary force of evil designed to destroy good men.\" Courtenay tells Peekay's story in an episodic manner and does at times exhibit the one thing about novels which does bug me which is the number of coincidences or events where the lead character is found to be at the right moment in history. That said, this story is a great beach read (where I read it) and moves along as you grow up along side young Peekay as he learns that an education along with boxing skills sets him on a path to leadership and helps him achieve a kind of revenge on all the judges of the world that would keep him down. He learns the power of one. Peekay says, \"Doc had taught me the value of being the odd man out: the man who senses that there is an essential collective sanity to humans and who assumes the roll of the loner, the thinker, and the searching spirit who calls the privileged and the powerful to task.  The power of one was based on the courage to remain separate, to think through to the truth, and not to be beguiled by convention or the plausible arguments of those who expect to maintain power. There is also a lot of boxing in this story and if I had known that up front I might have passed on reading the book. However, the boxing is not only a good medifore but very well written into the fabric of the narrative. In many cases you almost feel the blow yourself as Peekay attempts to become a champion. And lastly I might note that blacks are a large part of this story but don't take leadership rolls... they are in fact to be protected by their white liberal benefactors which is a bit condescending but I believe reflective of the era that story takes place. If you're in the mood for a great coming of age story with vivid characters and events this might be the perfect read.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Good, but not McDermid's best work", "text": "I started reading Val McDermid's novels featuring Dr. Tony Hill after watching the British T.V. drama \"Wire in the Blood,\" which was initially based on that series of books. Even though those novels supplied more cruelty and gore than I would've normally liked, I enjoyed them overall because McDermid 1) presented interesting characters under unusual pressures and 2) kept the plot moving.<br /><br />I like her latest, \"A Darker Domain,\" but am not crazy about it, mainly due to the lack of her normal strengths -- interesting characters and narrative drive -- as the book progressed onward to a not-terribly-surprising ending.<br /><br />This is not a Tony Hill novel but a D.I. Karen Pirie one. The present-day story revolves around two cold cases from the 1980s. The first: the disappearance of a striking (and strike-breaking?) miner; the second: a double kidnapping involving the family of a semi-titan of industry. It becomes evident as the novel progresses that the two cases are in fact tied together, and D.I. Pirie, with the help of reporter Bel Richmond, ultimately solves the puzzle.<br /><br />I have read that McDermid grew up in a mining family and thus has some insight to share regarding the sufferings of the mining community in 1980s Britain. But it seems she might be too close to the topic as it sometimes gets her off course plot-wise and pulls her occasionally into political (and polemical) areas that don't suit the book.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say if you like the author's previous works, you'll like this one. If you haven't yet read McDermid, I'd recommend starting with either the first Tony Hill novel, \"The Mermaids Singing,\" or the non-Tony-Hill novel \"A Place of Execution,\" which might just be her best so far.", "images": [], "asin": "0061688983", "parent_asin": "0061688983", "user_id": "AGYO7XP7YGN5MVWQT2B254GWJD2Q", "timestamp": 1242738525000, "helpful_vote": 27, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Can Christians live without apologists?", "text": "In a nutshell, Ravi Zacharias's Can Man Live Without God is a work whose premise is that we as individuals and as a society need God, the Christian God, to live meaningful lives. The main thrust of the reasoning in this book is that atheism, or \"antitheism\" as Zacharias puts it, is harmful or even deadly. \"Antitheism\" is defined as the denial of God's existence.<br /><br />Some of the key points presented in this book include<br /><br />Material affluence results in \"anguish.\"<br />Living without God makes life unlivable if antitheism is \"consistently carried through.\"<br />Hitler \"lived without God\" which explains his genocidal actions.<br />Stalin's genocide was a result of his being an atheist.<br />Antitheists have no \"rational basis\" for morality.<br />Antitheism provides no solace for hurting people.<br />Antitheistic philosophers like Nietzsche and Russell are at fault for social problems such as divorce.<br />For antitheists, life has no meaning.<br /><br />You can make what you wish of the above assertions, but Zacharias does a good job of writing about the issues raised. His book is interesting and provocative, and he fills its pages with many heart-tugging examples to illustrate some of its most salient points. I found myself taking time out from other activities to read it.<br /><br />Who will like Can Man Live Without God? I'd recommend it to anybody who's interested in the debate waged between atheists and Christians regarding not only the existence of God but how the ideas that may result from belief and disbelief can impact society. I believe that Christians in particular might appreciate this book because it may strengthen their faith when it comes under fire by skeptics.<br /><br />Being a skeptic myself, I unsurprisingly have some criticisms of this work. First and foremost, I must call Zacharias to task for not providing data for his claims. All of the evidence he provides is anecdotal, and anybody with a modicum of scientific knowledge may ask where the statistics are to demonstrate that \"antitheists\" are more likely to be violent or despotic than those who believe in the Christian God.<br /><br />What might possibly be even more obviously amiss with this book is Zacharias not explaining which Gods we presumably cannot live with or without. As a former Hindu, he should be acutely aware that there are more than two viewpoints on the existence of God, atheism and Christianity. What of Jews, Muslims, and Hindus? They have their Gods yet they don't believe in the Christian God. Do they suffer from the same maladies that antitheists allegedly do? If so, then one can believe in God but still be as bad off as Zacharias believes antitheists are. If not, then the Christian God is not necessary to live one's life with morality and meaning.<br /><br />In closing, I'd recommend Can Man Live Without God. It's interesting, provocative, and reflective of the ideological struggle between modern rationalism and traditional Christian belief. It does leave me with a question for debate: Can Christians live without apologists like Zacharias?", "images": [], "asin": "0849945283", "parent_asin": "0849945283", "user_id": "AGOFYFA6354JGAEMQB3Y3M5RCTQA", "timestamp": 1183820092000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Perfect for Curling up on the Sofa with a Cup of Hot Soup", "text": "I picked this up quite by chance one day in the local public library, filling in time as one does. It had a look of promise about it - successful novelist, self help book writer, and respected New York based journalist who has won the Pulitzer Prize - lots going for it. Without being earth shattering or extraordinarily brilliant as one would expect from a writer with such credentials, this is a most comfortable read. Sort of curl up on the couch with your slippers and bowl of hot soup type of read.<br /><br />As it states on the cover this is a memoir. Not an autobiography, or stand-on-the-soapbox-aging-baby-boomer rave. Ms Quindlen is a commentator, using elements of her personal and public lives, to reflect on matters which have been particularly relevant for women of her generation - she is now 60 years old. With themes ranging from being a mum, being a working mum, being a wife, being a daughter, a friend, body image, getting older, this is a book full of reflections and a fair amount of wisdom. The author nursed and lost her mother at a young age. There is a certain sadness in much of the book because of this, and it may well have been the defining event in her life. As a result there is a certain 'take time to smell the roses' thread running through. And there is nothing wrong with that in a book either.<br /><br />It has had mixed reviews in book circles, but I actually found it just a really nice book to read. Here is a woman who was at the vanguard of women 'having it all', who helped lay the foundations for those of us who followed along in her footsteps. Some things went well, some didn't, and she is quite open in her musings.", "images": [], "asin": "0739378554", "parent_asin": "0739378554", "user_id": "AEODGMBI2RFWDPCKQZ2LLWZ75IGQ", "timestamp": 1368525353000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Eat like a Rock Star", "text": "Chris Taylor spends most of his time touring with his band, Grizzly Bear, but musicians have to eat, too.  Turns out, Taylor likes to eat well, cook with friends.  Yes, cook with, not for, friends.  This is a lovely way to bond and minimize some of the stress that comes with entertaining.  You eliminate the need to make things perfect if you cook with, but you do need to have the space/kitchen to allow more cooks in the kitchen.  I simply don't.  I have always dreamed of a large, open kitchen (and a Steinway grand piano), but have always been cursed with a Manhattan galley kitchen.<br /><br />Like Taylor, however, I spend most of time writing, teaching, performing, so when I cook and entertain, I want it to be an enjoyable experience.  Not too stressful.  So I appreciate many of the recipes in here that are meant to inspire.  They tell you in the intro to feel free to tear the book apart, write in the margins, change things around, cross things out.<br /><br />Neither Taylor nor Schori are dssert guys, so credit for the desserts belongs to Lillie O'Brien.<br /><br />The book is divided by seasons.  The photos are lovely and definitely whet your appetite.  The recipes are very friendly and invite improvisation.  The pork chops and charred applesauce looks delicious, and charring the applesauce elevates this dish.  The plating in this book is artistic, and I like their philosophy about plating.  Even though we're all tempted to serve family style when we have big groups of people over with differing diet concerns, Taylor and Schori noticed that people end up eating components separately that way.  Sometimes, flavors pop and foodgasms happen when you mix dishes together.  For example, the sauteed snaps and mushrooms with soft boiled eggs might change how you compose a salad.<br /><br />This is a wonderful cookbook for people who want to enjoy simple satisfying food without the hours and hours of stress.  Don't overcomplicate, overthink, just do it.<br /><br />I received this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "0385345283", "parent_asin": "0385345283", "user_id": "AFEKAWHB6HHJRUWNPWHLYBKVIAPQ", "timestamp": 1429718378000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

All the songs are relatively easy to play.  If you are a staunch beginner they will be challenging, but a moderate player should have little trouble with them.  The melody is included in a separate staff above the standard notation for guitar, which is above TAB for those who can't read music.  Nice printing, dark and large enough to be easily seen and the book opens easily and will stay open on my music stand with the use of wooden clothespins.<br /><br />I'm not exactly thrilled with the tunes however.  I wanted \"Ballads\" but I took a chance on this book hoping for some much older tunes, so I'm kind of disappointed about that.  And I don't like over half of the tunes anyway so there's only a few I might use.  It's not a bad book, but the melodies are very simplified and in some situations with these type of books I often will change the notation a bit to give the tune more flare. But, they're o.k. the way they are.  There are no exotic key signatures to deal with, most have just one sharp with no more than three, and no flatted keys, so the sight-reading isn't all that challenging.  Some left-hand fingering suggestions are given in the notation but not in the TAB section.  Actually, nothing extra is given in the TAB - only what fret on what string.  You'll have to look at the notation to determine your timing, which is a good reason, among MANY to go ahead and learn to read standard notation. (o.k. rant over. I teach classical guitar so I'm sort of biased against TAB).  No right-hand fingerings are given but for those who have studied classical guitar, this book should present no problems in either area, LH or RH.", "images": [], "asin": "0634098934", "parent_asin": "0634098934", "user_id": "AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ", "timestamp": 1247686041000, "helpful_vote": 47, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Taut and Timely Thriller", "text": "Reeve has a fragile grip on reality. Wedded to her routine, she is slowly acclimating to life after being abducted and held captive for four years. After six years of therapy with a psychologist who pioneered her treatment, she is gradually gaining confidence and a tentative sense of independence and control. But all that is threatened when her therapist asks her to speak to a young victim of a similar crime. After reluctantly agreeing she becomes drawn into an investigation of similar cases. With intelligence and grit, she confronts her fears and limitations to vanquish an insidious evil.<br /><br />The story is chilling and Reeve is a heroine to love. She is bright and refreshingly honest. Her romantic dilemma is handled with sensitivity and she is a strong and believable character. There were a few missteps. The prosecutor was a one dimensional harpy. I doubt very much that an experienced and ambitious politician would be as obnoxious to a victim of a horrific sex crime as she was to Reeve.  The therapist who has supported her  evaporates mid story, supposedly beset by personal problems and professional commitments. The subplot of Reeve's attacker applying for release from prison was poorly developed and distracting. I found Reeve's introduction in the investigation implausible. It seems that someone further along in the recovery process would be invited to commiserate with a new victim. Still, this is a fascinating and spine chilling read.

{"rating": 5, "title": "One helluva good read. Highly recommended", "text": "EPITAPH: A NOVEL OF THE O.K. CORRAL is the third Mary Doria Russell book I've read. The first was [[ASIN:081298000X Doc: A Novel]], all about Doc Holliday's early life and how he met the Earps. Then I read [[ASIN:0345485556 Dreamers of the Day: A Novel]], an historical novel framed by the 1921 Cairo Peace Conference. EPITAPH returns us once again to the Earp brothers and the American West of the early 1880s, this time not Dodge City, but Tombstone and the O.K. Corral, and we all know what happened there. Or we thought we did if we grew up in the 50s and 60s and watched all those dumb Wyatt Earp TV shows starring Hugh O'Brien, and then a lot of movies about the O.K. Corral. (Actually I've only seen one of them, the Henry Fonda one, MY DARLING CLEMENTINE.) But after reading DOC and its encyclopedic look at Holliday's early life and the world he lived in, I have come to respect Russell's slant on things. She researches and researches and then researches some more, and then turns all that research into some of the most eminently readable and intelligent novels I've ever encountered. And EPITAPH, her latest, is no exception. While the subtitle indicates it's about the O.K. Corral showdown, readers will quickly discover that the shootout itself - which Russell tells us first thing lasted probably no more than half a minute tops - is merely the axis upon which a much larger story turns, and it is, like DOC, a roller-coaster of a page-turner which, not incidentally, also gives you a fascinating look at the politics of the 1880s and how that gunfight fit into the larger scheme of things.<br /><br />We learn, for example, that the Tombstone story played out during the short, tragic presidency of James Garfield, a professor of Greek and Latin at tiny Hiram College in Ohio, and a reluctant candidate who gave his party \"warning that he would do nothing to gain the office ... He'd kept his word too, traveling no farther than his own front porch during the campaign.\" When Garfield died from wounds inflicted by an assassin, his VP, Chester Arthur, proved to be a weak, ineffectual and fearful successor. And this is only a small part of the historical frame Russell provides for her saga of the Earps and Holliday. The border tensions between the Arizona Territory and Mexico, fueled by cattle thieves and outlaws, also figure into the story, as do the devious and crooked politics of the times. Wyatt Earp and his brothers, all lawmen, fall victim to these politics, and the resulting actions are reminiscent of the recent racial tensions and grand jury investigations of police officers in Missouri and New York. In this respect, the larger story of the O.K. Corral becomes relevant and timely, even though it happened over a hundred and thirty years ago.<br /><br />So yes, Russell knows her history and uses it to her best advantage. But she is also incredibly skilled at bringing these real historical figures to life. And not just the Earps and their women, but also the other lawmen and townspeople. Even the villains become real - the two McLaury brothers (one a gentle farmer, the other a blowhard troublemaker), the Clantons (the brutal, abusive patriarch; the fearful, damaged older son, Ike; and the wild younger son, Billy), and the notorious psychopath, Johnny Ringo; as well as a large cast of minor characters both good and bad. But after Wyatt and Doc, perhaps the most fascinating figure here is the woman who came to love Wyatt and stayed with him for over forty years, Josie \"Sadie\" Marcus.<br /><br />Hey, I could go on and on about this book, but I'd better not. It's a pretty damn good one though. If I had any problem at all with the book it would be that the first couple hundred pages (it runs nearly 600 pages), which, while  filled with interesting historical stuff, may have lumbered just a bit. In fact the best part of the book comes after the gunfight - the political fallout and betrayals, when the police officers - the Earps and Holliday - are painted as vicious killers and are arrested and tried. Sound familiar? Well, I told ya. And then there are the later years of Wyatt Earp, years of wandering from place to place, trying to escape his storied past.<br /><br />EPITAPH is one helluva good read. I suspect it may be the most complete and accurate look at the famous gunfight, the events that precipitated it, and the aftermath ever written. And it's also a great 'docu-novel' of the life of Wyatt Earp. Probably the best book of that sort I've read since Darryl Ponicsan's [[ASIN:0440059690 Tom Mix died for your sins: A novel based on his life]]. It's always a difficult and touchy task to fictionalize the life of a real historical personage. Ponicsan did it well with the colorful Tom Mix. And now so has Mary Doria Russell with Wyatt Earp. I recommend this book highly.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Excellent--a well written look at global migration/refugee issues--and solutions. Thought-provoking.", "text": "This book was written before the world learned that the U.S. government had forcibly and often with no warning, taken thousands of children from their parents. This was done with no plans to reunite them and justified as a \"deterrent\" to other migrants fleeing violence in Central America.<br /><br />What a tragedy. The world has more refugees now--60 million, nearly half of them children--than at any time in history. And yet our current government is focused on creating false reasons to fear them, rather than giving humane reasons to help them.<br /><br />The current administration may have learned nothing from history, but Jacqueline Bhabha has. This is a factual book about migration, but also a philosophical book about morality and ethics. She first analyzes the situation world-wide (the \"problem\"), then asks the questions that humane societies should ask themselves about what is realistic to do? What is our individual and collective responsibility? She explains the laws that apply to international refugee migration as well as so-called \"economic migration\", for hardship. She reminds us that \"the primary drivers of distress migration are conflict, natural disasters and climate change, global inequality and demographic changes\" adding, \"no solution to the current refugee and immigration crisis can be found solely by addressing its most evident symptoms.\" (p113).<br /><br />Hers is a global perspective with global solutions suggested. She looks at the world-wide refugee migration trends and what nations can do, including through the United Nations. It is a broad view, not just focused on the United States, but very important for the United States, caught in a moral crisis. She pays attention to the effect of this situation on a young generation of millions of refugees--what will they grow into, left as they are in the refuse camps of the world, deprived of education and the basic essentials of existence that most of the world enjoys?<br /><br />Bhabha doesn't just describe the problems--which she does very well--she takes on the solutions, an array of very specific ones. This is a small book--only 132 pages--but its an important one. It's a call to conscience that includes real-world recommendations for ways to help. Definitely recommended (This is well written and an easy read--I can think of several college courses where this would be excellent required reading, stimulating discussion and thought.)", "images": [], "asin": "1509519408", "parent_asin": "1509519408", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1548308564397, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 5, "title": "Poetry from the heart", "text": "Reaching for Dawn by Ann Christine Tabaka is a collection of poems that are rich with clear images. The reader is on firm footing throughout, able to feel and understand all aspects of the speaker\u2019s reflections in each poem in this collection. As I read Reaching for Dawn, I felt the highs and many lows the poems\u2019 persona experienced. Such clear writing is to be admired in modern poetry. Academic poetry tends to obscure meaning, eschewing plainness for artiness, urbanity for folksiness. Ann\u2019s strength is in her very plain poems and, as those of us raised in small towns can attest, there are folk remedies which work just as well or better than technically-advanced ones and many people prefer folk art more than they do high art. In the folk quality of many of her finest poems, Ann Christine Tabaka excels.<br /><br />When Ann tries artistic tricks, she fails. This is not a bad thing, for it reveals that her magic is not in trickery but in truth, in plainness, in coming forward with her messages clearly and not trying to dress them up in whatever vogue is of-the-moment. To be timeless, a work of art needs to speak directly to the heart, not to the tastes of the times in which the piece was crested. Reaching for Dawn\u2019s best poems will speak to readers long after the author has passed-on.<br /><br />There is much sadness in Reaching for Dawn. In several poems we have flowers/petals falling to the ground/the floor, a symbol of sorrow and/or the harsh passage of time. We also have repeated occurrences of lonely nights, feelings of isolation, and bewilderment. We have all had such feelings, helping to give the poems meaning for readers. But as the persona of the poems suffers through the bewilderment, loss, loneliness, sadness, and time\u2019s cold grip, I am still left wondering if the reach is really for dawn or for some other form of relief, for won\u2019t dawn just lead to more of the same sad aspects of life, a new day or trials and not a day of triumph?<br /><br />The final two pages of Reaching for Dawn give the reader hope that the persona as a chance, at least, of triumph. In \u201cA New Day Dawns\u201d we see the persona start the day shaking off yesterday and last night full of finger-crossed hope that a better day is ahead. Then, in all caps and surprisingly large print Ann gives the admonition that a poem is sometimes just a poem and, in effect, that the reader should not assume the deeper messages they have just read are really all that deep, all that true after all. Some poems, Ann writes, may well be true, some may not be, which now leaves the reader to wonder WHICH of the poems that Ann wrote ARE true and which are not, which show her real feelings and experiences, and which do not. It\u2019s not a coquettish wink, for she has stoked-up and revealed quite honest emotions. It\u2019s more a seeming discomfort that the reader may assume that she has gone through what the persona of the poems has gone through. It\u2019s maybe a reassurance that Ann herself is fine and just writing poetry in Delaware, that the reader need not worry about her.<br /><br />Let\u2019s hope that this is the case and that we\u2019ll get many more poems from Ann Christine Tabaka.", "images": [], "asin": "1986797104", "parent_asin": "1986797104", "user_id": "AGHB765FVRI3UXYJFKGJFH4PKLLQ", "timestamp": 1542860339055, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 5, "title": "Redirecting Classical Economics", "text": "David Ricardo played a crucial role in developing Classical Economics. Ricardo was prompted to write on economics by reading The Wealth of Nations. As luck would have it, Ricardo knew James Mill (father of JS Mill) and was soon in contact with TR Malthus. The debates between Ricardo and Malthus produced a paradigm that lasted only a half a century. PPE+T is a central part of the Classical paradigm, it is Ricardo's definitive statement on economics.<br /><br />PPE+T is perhaps the most tightly reasoned book written by a Classical economists (JS Mill is a close rival here). This is not fun reading but it is important as a piece of history, and elements of Ricardo's analysis remain relevant today. Given Ricardo's razor sharp intellect, one must wonder why he did not develop modern value theory himself. The tight reasoning of this book is, ironically, the source of much criticism against it. Joseph Schumpeter (among others) has lamented `the Ricardian vice', by which Ricardo arrived at policy conclusions through flawless but restrictive logical reasoning. Ricardo is hard to argue against, given his assumptions, but what if we alter these assumptions?<br /><br />While Classical Economics is dead, some of its Ricardian elements live on. The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation remains relevant today largely because of Ricardo's concept of Comparative Advantage. Comparative Advantage is one of the most enduring ideas in economics. The development of the Comparative Advantage concept set Ricardo ahead of all but a few of his contemporaries. Economists still speak of Ricardian Equivalence and The Ricardo Effect. While some might object Ricardo's logical-deductive approach to political economy, few economists have stood the test of time so well. PPE+T is a timeless classic. This is not fun reading, but it is important none the less.", "images": [], "asin": "0486434613", "parent_asin": "0486434613", "user_id": "AFFTBEFXJ6OINQY2S5VBBQ3P3VZQ", "timestamp": 1211293875000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "More about long-lasting women's friendships than a traditional holiday novel", "text": "This book seemed right up my alley--I love to bake and I love Christmas!  However, when I started reading it, I discovered that it is really more about women's friendships.  As the title suggests, the novel revolves around a cookie club that has been in place for about 15 years.  The narrator of the story is Marnie, otherwise known as the head cookie b*tch (yes, that is exactly what she is called in the book--and the overuse of this phrase gets a bit grating as the book goes on).  Marnie and eleven of her friends meet every year on the first Monday of December to exchange a baker's dozen cookies--twelve dozen with each other, and one dozen donated to their locate hospice.  The rules are quite strict, but the party itself is supposed to be fun, and most of the women look forward to it all year long.<br /><br />So that's the setup for the club.  The setup for the book itself is that author Ann Pearlman highlights the background story of each of the group's members separately in each chapter, beginning logically with Marnie.  But first, Pearlman opens the chapter by offering the cookie recipe which that particular club member has brought to the party that year.  Given the rules of no chocolate chip (too common) and no bars (too messy), these recipes are unique and different, and I definitely hope to try a few of them.  Although I thought the recipes added to the story, I didn't like how Pearlman ended each chapter.  Here she provides educational information on the history of various baking ingredients--for example, flour, nuts, vanilla, salt, etc.  These short descriptions would have been appropriate in a cookbook, but they seem truly out of place in a novel.<br /><br />Finally, a note about the stories of the women themselves.  I definitely did enjoy reading the lives of each of these women unfold between the pages of the book, but other readers should be forewarned:  this is NOT an uplifting Christmas book!  Each and every one of the women of the club experiences a life that is marked by trauma and tragedy, to the point where it seemed like Pearlman went a bit overboard.  There is true grief and loss within the first chapter, so those who aren't looking for that kind of read might want to save this book until after the holidays or skip it altogether.  A final issue in reading this novel is that with twelve women in the group--not to mention former members, husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, children, etc.--it was sometimes difficult to keep everyone straight!<br /><br />Although there were a few things that I did not like about this book (as mentioned above), overall I did enjoy it, and I would recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "1439158843", "parent_asin": "1439158843", "user_id": "AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA", "timestamp": 1259422845000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Enjoyable", "text": "\"Too Close to Home\" is a fast-paced romantic suspense novel. The characters were likable and realistic, and the romance was very nicely done and realistically awkward at times. The world-building was good, but in a few places I questioned if the police, FBI, or EMS really would do things that way in real life (like an ambulance taking away a dead body when wounded living still needed help).<br /><br />The suspense was high, but I didn't really enjoy it in the first part because the main characters kept doing foolish things that put them in danger (like they tried to get the killer to come after them and Samantha was nearly killed at her home, yet she went to stay with her sister without taking any security precautions). But this wasn't a problem in the second part. Also, the bad guy in this novel was clever, and the case was very interesting.<br /><br />The killer was one of the point of view characters and the author didn't try very hard to conceal his identity, so I realized who he was a long time before our heroes did. While this did create some suspense, it also made me frustrated that our heroes took so long to pay attention to the clues that were now especially obvious to me.<br /><br />There were several Christians in the novel. Christians were portrayed realistically, with both the good and bad shown. The character's beliefs were worked in as a meaningful part of their lives. I really liked how this was handled. The novel wasn't preachy, and it didn't settle for the pat answers for evil and suffering but went deeper.<br /><br />There was no sex and no bad language. Overall, I would recommend this novel as enjoyable, clean reading, and I look forward to reading her other novels.<br /><br />I received this book from the publisher as a free review copy.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debbie from Genre Reviews<br />(genrereviews. blogspot. com)", "images": [], "asin": "080073369X", "parent_asin": "080073369X", "user_id": "AGRCXV4NM763VGZGD6BQ2VGNCJNA", "timestamp": 1271167911000, "helpful_vote": 149, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 5, "title": "An interesting and intellectual contrary opinion", "text": "Robert Woodson Sr. Is the founder and President of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise (NCNE) It emphasizes the importance of self empowerment and self management approaches for ending poverty.  Woodson worked for the National Urban League, and he was a research fellow with the American Enterprise Institute before leaving, in 1981, to found NCNE.<br /><br />Woodson, and the individual essay writers he has gathered here, acknowledge endemic hindrances to Black achievement  in the United States.  Their main focus, however, is in describing how young Black Americans can use their own personal, real, abilities to raise themselves out of the negative consequences of the generational failure that seems to permeate Black life in the United States.<br /><br />Simply put, stop thinking of yourself as a \u201cvictim\u201d, doomed to failure.  You are not!  You will only fail if you live your life as a victim, blaming others for your perceived failures.  Even with the negative consequences of slavery, and Jim Crow and Segregation, seeing yourself as a \u201cvictim\u201d, and blaming fate and others for your position in life, doesn\u2019t make you strong.  In fact, it makes you weak.  It makes you even more dependent on the \u201cgenerosity\u201d, the magnanimity, of politicians and \u201chustlers\u201d who make their living\u2014a very good one, too\u2014promising Black Americans to raise them out of the situation in which they find themselves.<br /><br />To me, accepting this line of thinking is a fascinating event, because the same people, or their fathers before them, have been promising Black Americans\u2014I\u2019ll call it\u2014salvatio if they only vote, and support, them.  This has been going on for over sixty years.  Nothing, in all that time, seems to have changed-except the collapse of the Black family and the general failure of Black education.  Following that line of thinking, in short, has ended badly.<br /><br />Anyway, the book\u2019s essays are well thought out, intellectually honest, and are an honest response to the current \u201csalvation\u201d method:  Critical Race Theory (CRT).  It\u2019s definitely a motivating, worthwhile, read\u2014even though it will, probably, not overcome the current racial grand issue (CRT), it does intelligently describe another way.<br /><br />But, after all is said and done, I\u2019m a caucasian, so I probably shouldn\u2019t be believed as far as the way out of poverty is concerned.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Another fascinating book...", "text": "Where Shall Wisdom be Found? is another fascinating book by Harold Bloom.  He (somewhat arbitrarily) chooses the greatest wisdom writers of all time, and his perspective on their work is very illuminating.  He goes through the history of the western world and selects two authors from each time period.  The couplets are Job and Ecclesiastes (books, not people), Plato and Homer, Cervantes and Shakespeare, Montaigne and Francis Bacon, Samuel Johnson and Goethe, Emerson and Nietzche, Freud and Proust, and Thomas and Saint Augustine.<br /><br />Even though I highly recommend this work, I disagree with much of what Mr. Bloom has to say.  What makes it worthwhile is his invaluable commentary of the figures listed above - who they were, and the thoughts they express.  However, nowhere in the book does Bloom give us HIS definition of what wisdom is - and everything is judged by his own very personal standards.<br /><br />Literary criticism is, by definition, subjective; and it is Mr. Bloom's own personal prejudices that may put some readers off.  In his defense, at least he is honest about his prejudices.  \"I agree with absolutely nothing in The City of God, but then the book is not addressed to a Jew and a Gnostic.\"  Mr. Bloom constantly reminds us that he is not a philosopher; so, in the battle between literature and philosophy, he continuously asserts that we prefer literature.  He considers Plato the greatest philosopher, but casually tosses him aside with preference to Homer, Cervantes, and Shakespeare.<br /><br />In trying to decipher his criteria for wisdom, it seems to center on useful aphorisms.  It seems to be the reason he prefers literature rather than carefully constructed philosophical arguments.  I had a logic teacher who uses to disparage maxims as \"bumper sticker philosophy,\" and I think he has a point.<br /><br />Also, in this stage in his career, Mr. Bloom has lost sight of who the true enemy is.  He continues a pointless and wrongheaded feud with Stephen King and J. K. Rowling as `enemies of literacy.'  Nothing could be further off base.  He writes that his criteria for reading are \"aesthetic splendor, intellectual power, wisdom.\"  These are not the only criteria - sometimes you just want a good story.  And, if I may be a philistine for a moment, I do think you can find a bit of wisdom even from Harry Potter, unless you are determined not to find it.<br /><br />At a reading, Mr. Bloom said he should have included Kierkegaard, who keeps popping up in this book.  I think Kierkegaard would have illuminated much about wisdom.  It is not so much about saying that Plato is wrong and Shakespeare is right, but about one's own commitment to a belief system.  Bloom rightly points out that literature holds a mirror, not to nature, but to ourselves.  We find the wisdom in books that we are looking for.  Mr. Bloom's wisdom may not be yours.", "images": [], "asin": "1573222844", "parent_asin": "1573222844", "user_id": "AFS5WG7LHUZJVOZHPMPESFULFK3Q", "timestamp": 1098795206000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "In many ways a classic picaresque novel", "text": "Amy Bloom's Away is in many ways a classic picaresque novel: an episodic story chronicling the life a low-caste rascal embarked on a quest and featuring a new and memorable secondary character at each major turning point. Lillian Leyb is not a rascal by nature, but circumstance forces her into a series of petty crimes. A peasant living in a shtetl in the 1924 Russia of Joseph Stalin, Lillian loses her entire family in a bloody pogrom, with her parents and husband killed, and her two-year-old daughter, Sophie, missing. After a cousin tells her of seeing Sophie's body floating past in the river, Lillian heads for America and winds up living with another cousin an apartment on the Lower East Side where the immigrant boarders sleep in day and night shifts. Though she can barely sew, intelligent and resourceful Lillian manages to land a job in the costume department of a Yiddish theater, leading us to the first of the memorable minor characters: a theatrical impresario, his matinee idol son, and his tailor-turned-playwright. Lillian's New York idyll when another cousin arrives from the old country with news that her daughter isn't dead but rather was rescued from the pogrom and adopted by a couple who headed east to Siberia rather than west to America. Determined to reclaim Sophie and in possession of trip plan complete with maps ripped out of from library books, Lillian chooses the shortest possible route -- west to Seattle, north to Alaska, and west again across the Bering Strait to Siberia. The New York episode and flasbacks to Russia take up the first 100 pages of this short novel and her quest the final 140 pages. On the trip we meet Gumdrop, a black Seattle prostitute, and Chinky Chan, an accomplished grifter from a family of swindlers. Unlike so many literary novels, Away offers both memorable characters and an engaging plot. Although the bulk of the novel is told from the viewpoint of Lillian and a handful of other characters, now and then an omniscient all-knowing narrator appears who offers a capsulized life story of the engaging characters Lillian leaves in her wake. A short fun read whose characters will stick with you after you've finished the book.", "images": [], "asin": "0812977793", "parent_asin": "0812977793", "user_id": "AEQSAHZ2DYDR6OIZX2G3WCXSEWYA", "timestamp": 1306256362000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "One of the most important works ever written", "text": "In the history of written language, few books have proved to be as important (and as entertaining) as The Histories by Herodotus.  Not only is this the first historical text ever written, it's also a thrilling tale of adventure, intrigue, and heroism.  Beginning with the Trojan War (the most important event in history, according to the ancient Greeks), Herodotus tracks the development of the mighty Persian Empire and its eventual clash with the peoples of Greece in the 5th century B.C.  Along the way, the reader is given a guided tour of the people and places of the ancient world.  If your knowledge of this time period is based exclusively on The History Channel and \"300\", reading this book will give you a new appreciation for like in the distant past.<br /><br />Be warned though, Herodotus, at times, is more concerned with telling a good story than a true one.  It seems impossible to think that he had access to all the places and events he describes; in many cases, he obviously either invents stories or passes along accepted myths.  Furthermore, as the inventor of the history text, he really had no idea where to begin his story or what was relevant to his purpose (which was describing how and why the Greeks were able to defeat the invading Persians).  To solve this problem it seems, Herodotus included every source and every anecdote he had access to.  To help move the story along for the reader, I would recommend skipping over the section devoted to the geography of Egypt (or any of the other long passages related to mountains, rivers or deserts for that matter) - doing so will not interfer at all with the rest of the book.<br /><br />This is an endlessly diverting and dense work to read, especially if you don't know very much about ancient history, yet it's also very entertaining and very enlightening.  Herodotus' treatment of war, politics and human behavior are still as relevant today as it was 2500 years ago.  There is a reason why this book is still read to this day, and anyone who wants to consider themselves \"well-read\" needs to read this work.", "images": [], "asin": "0140449086", "parent_asin": "0140449086", "user_id": "AFKI6LRA4K7OQDO4VNWI6EORANMA", "timestamp": 1198409394000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Reads more like a horror story than romance. Fun times", "text": "Great. As if silk shirts weren't enough, the H has a suede suit. Ye gods, you Brits.<br /><br />Continuing with the sartorial portion of our review, gentle readers, I don't even want to know what a \"body shirt\" is 'cause the H is wearing one.<br /><br />UPDATE: I don't know which is more appalling: the disclosure on page 164 that gobsmaks the h and me or black suede pants and black leather jerkin the H wears on page 168.<br /><br />REVIEW<br /><br />Honestly don't know what to say, but my heart pounded on a couple of occasions. Serious case of \"Molly, you in danger girl!\" If Anne Mather had sold this as a horror story, it would be a 4 star, hands down. This h is snakebit.<br /><br />This plot was filled with one of the biggest collection of nasty, need to die characters as I have ever come across: the lying father of the H, the lying and distant mother of the h, the lying, criminal as well as abusive husband of the h. Surprisingly, the H is not included in the abusive category. Given the wardrobe choices listed above he's a Courvoisier, a dose of Brut, and two sideburns away from belting out \"After the Loving\", but a bad guy he's not.<br /><br />Bottom line, our h and H grew up together, kind of. He was older, but never had a real GF until the h turned 18. He was waiting for her to grow up. Sweet right. Yeah, unfortunately as with most humans, these two had parents. They would have been better off raised by wolves frankly. The h's father commits suicide, and suddenly the H is nowhere to be found. After a year or so, the h flops into a relationship with a dweeb then marriage. Another unfortunate incident, the fiancee with mommy issues that the h is thinking of kicking to the curb has an accident four days before the wedding and is paralyzed so she HAS to marry him.<br /><br />A few years later, the H arrives and wants her to see his father who was always like an uncle to her. Hubby's not happy. Before she leaves for the islands, she finds out he was having an affair as late as the week of their wedding, and she's the one who gets slapped. The H brings along his piece of the week who happily tells the h she's pregnant. She's not.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />At the island, the H's father tells her that HE told HER father that she was his daughter. I'll wait while you ponder that one out.....Hmm, I wonder if that confession had anything to do with the h's father blowing his brains out. The h's mom was there and denied it all to the h's father, but apparently he didn't believe it as the other two had had a sexual relationship before. The h then figures out that the H, the love of her life, must think they were half-siblings, and that was why he broke it off. It doesn't explain the still handsy way he is with her. Nothing too much, but still a big ick if he thinks she's such forbidden fruit. She leaves soon for England.<br /><br />Back home in rainy England she finds out more. The H's dad dies and wants to leave her half his fortune. Guilt money. A visit to the attorney to deny it (she has somewhat of martyr complex) she finds out that her husband had a child with the woman he was with which explains why he never received any insurance money from the accident. She also finds out that her mother was the one who lied to the H and said they were half-siblings out of spite and social snobbery. I love it when these British novels play the social class card.<br /><br />It all winds up nicely as, unfortunately, the mother is forgiven and the horrible husband is paid off. Suffer, suffer, suffer.<br /><br />The romance was secondary to the whole machinations of all the other evil ones here. Anne must have been in a cranky mood the week she wrote this. A few tweaks and Frankenstein would have a run for its money.", "images": [], "asin": "B000PCB390", "parent_asin": "B000PCB390", "user_id": "AGV2YOLD4L2ZE4XWOUOJYSZ7ILLQ", "timestamp": 1541778239573, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I don't want to give the story away and with over 6000 reviews already, I'll keep this one relatively short.<br />The only things that didn't work so well for me that may work perfectly well for so many others were the lack of character depth for a handful of side/main characters and the flow of the story.  It wasn't the jumping dates so much as just a disconnect.

{"rating": 1, "title": "This is pretty bad. I am baffled by all these five-star reviews.", "text": "This novelization starts out pretty strong. We see the old King Hamlet, brooding, drinking, lamenting the politics and decadence of his court, compared to the Viking virtues of war and conquest... this is good stuff, a well-written unpacking of many things Shakespeare's play merely touched upon. Kind of like high-class &#34;fan fiction&#34;, bringing a certain historicity and context to a well-known, and much-beloved story.<br /><br />Then it quickly goes off the rails. The author's most egregious fault lies in altering the perfectly-balanced characters (or maybe perfectly-unbalanced) borne of Shakespeare's genius. Their motivations, actions, background, and histories are changed. With the possible exception of the old King Hamlet, every character in the novel (especially the Prince)  is made dumber, blander, mushier, and worse than their counterparts in the play. The balance of the plot and players is thrown out the window, and every character is reduced to essentially the same personality: selfish, conniving, full of ennui. They are all the same, just placed in different roles and circumstances. It's like reading genre-fiction for adolescents. Where Shakespeare's Elsinore was a dazzling and bewildering tapestry of madness, lies, and moral complexity, this version of Elsinore is just a sticky, icky, soap-opera.<br /><br />The author makes the bumbling and embarrassing mistake of trying (repeatedly) to build tension and suspense surrounding perhaps the best-known and most widely-studied plot developments in the history of ever. It's kind of like reading a rendition of Humpty-Dumpty trying to build complacency and then fear in the reader about whether Humpty will be able to maintain his perch on the wall.<br /><br />The clumsy and awkward attempts to &#34;freshen up&#34; perhaps the greatest dramatic plot in all of literature, the dull and shallow homogenization of Shakespeare's bottomless and brilliant characters... these faults are unforgivably compounded by the smarmy and cringe-inducing eye-winks and in-jokes from the author, mostly delivered by the newly-invented character of (wait for it)...Yorick, Jr. (I swear I am not making this up). That's right. You know that skull to whom Shakespeare's Hamlet famously addresses his soliloquy on death and mortality? Well, in this novelization, said skull is given not only a lurid and melodramatic back-story, but also a living son, who follows Hamlet around making wisecracks and dirty jokes, and quoting famous lines from the play, complete with &#34;Hmm, where have I heard that before?&#34; type responses from the Prince, just in case you weren't perceptive enough to catch the joke without a laugh-track. If you ever thought Shakespeare's Hamlet was really missing a foul-mouthed, comical sort of Yoda/Mr Miyagi character to explain everything, this might be just the &#34;Hamlet&#34; you're looking for.", "images": [], "asin": "B00IRH401S", "parent_asin": "B00IRH401S", "user_id": "AHHL4VCKCJ56DBZWM2IFGM2QFUHA", "timestamp": 1401490641000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Gun-toting thugs, dark secrets, and even a hurricane... what else do you want?", "text": "This is a \"status plus\" entry in Mr. Parker's long-running series.  The \"status\" part is the usual reliable detective plot involving a violent crime or two, an inquisitive Spenser, lots of character banter, and the resolution of the crime or crimes involving a dark family secret or deep character flaw on someone's part (and often both).  That's all here, and if it's all a bit familiar, it's still as compelling as always in the author's capable hands.<br /><br />The \"plus\" part comes into play in the opening chapters, where we see something new: a huge multi-chapter murder/kidnapping scene set amid a huge hurricane.  Spenser is doing some security work at a wedding being held on some rich folks' private island when the hurricane hits, and it's quite something to see Spenser playing cat-and-mouse with the uzi-carrying kidnappers while the hurricane rages and Susan is in danger, too.  It's a pretty memorable fifty or sixty page opening, and a set piece not seen since the Star Wars-like storming-of-the-bad-guys'-fortress sequence from \"A Catskill Eagle\" many years ago.<br /><br />And later on, there's also a little controversy to thicken the broth, as Spenser makes some interesting decisions at the conclusion of the kidnapping investigation that even give Hawk pause for a moment.  Without revealing too much, I'll just say this: Spenser's always been more concerned with who orders the violence than with who actually pulls the trigger (the hired gun known simply as \"Ty Bop\" has been getting away with murder for years for this reason), so my jaw didn't drop too much over the resolution.  It is dark, though.<br /><br />On a somewhat lighter note, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't any further potential wedding talk between Spenser and Susan this time out.  And this after they practically set a date in the previous entry, \"Now and Then\".  Mr. Parker does like to keep us fans in suspense.<br /><br />In the end, \"Rough Weather\" continues the fairly high quality and fairly sharp stories of the last couple of \"Spenser\" novels.  That is, the formula is pretty apparent but 1) it's still a pretty good formula and 2) the actual stories lately have been pretty memorable.  Heck, even the scary, villainous \"Grey Man\" gets the patented Parker \"dark family secret\" treatment this time out.

She notices some changes around her concerning the Jews but isn't too concerned until one day she sees a horrific incident which makes her truly realize what's going on. This coupled with a chance encounter with Rosa, her Jewish housekeeper's daughter convinces Liesel that she must help the Jews. The reader is then taken to 1946 after the US has beaten the Germans in World War II and an American scientist, Sam Houghton, is assigned to help get information from Nazis and help rebuild Germany. He hires a woman named Anna as his secretary but she is hiding some dark secrets about her links to the Nazi party herself.<br /><br />As with stories about World War II, this story was full of indignities to Jews. It showed that some Germans, even though not believers of Hitler's rhetoric, were forced to comply and assist with his plans or risk death for them and their families. I truly admired Liesel and her mother, Ilse, for their stance but it was truly Liesel's brother and Ilse's son, Friedy, who I grew to love and who became my favorite character.<br /><br />This was a story that sadly showed how power can corrupt people who we think are incorruptible. And, it also showed how one person can make a difference if he/she really wants to.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Good book, great historian", "text": "When Paul Johnson writes biography, the intent is not simply to recount the facts of someone's life: it is didactic. Johnson is an historian who intends to teach a lesson with this writings, to show us what we should draw from the subject's life, works, and thoughts to better our own lives.<br /><br />Thus it is with Johnson's biography of Socrates, the first and perhaps still the greatest of the moral philosophers. Rather than a dry recitation of what we know of Socrates's life and works, Johnson looks at themes in Socrates' life --bravery; his love for Athens; an absolute commitment to doing what was right and just; and irony-- and uses them to illustrate those things that should be valuable in our own lives, and thus improve our lives for being valued. Johnson reads much into the texts and context, sometimes making assumptions and presenting them as facts because he's sure they must be true, and there is the occasional odd error, but the broad lessons Johnson teaches (or, rather, relates what Socrates taught) and the beauty in his writing make them forgivable. The Kindle version is clean, with no typos that I could spot, though it is rather expensive for such a  short book.<br /><br />Recommended as an introduction to the person, to help make the philosophy more accessible.", "images": [], "asin": "B0052REVCY", "parent_asin": "B0052REVCY", "user_id": "AF2YQCJDQGAKNAOFB7A2XEQBAVZQ", "timestamp": 1545203773417, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Quick and interesting, but lackluster citations", "text": "About: Marketing guru Lindstrom explains why we buy what we do. The main focus in on neuromarketing, which is how marketing, products, logos, scents etc, affect our brains unconsciously. Conducting a big study of 2,081 participants in 5 countries, Lindstrom got to see brain scans of folks as they viewed and thought about different brands, products and companies. A major takeaway is that frequently, what people say is not what they do. Lindstrom also covers the \"mirror neuron\" that helps explain why we want to emulate others. He also makes the argument that brands can be like a religion (the twisting of Oreos as ritual, for example).<br /><br />Interesting Things I Learned:<br /><br />  * NASCAR fans are very brand loyal<br /><br />  * Sex doesn't always sell<br /><br />  * About 90% of buying behavior is unconscious<br /><br />  * Aromas and sounds are very effective at persuading customers unconsciously<br /><br />  * Product placement only works if it makes sense in the program, i.e. Reese's Pieces luring E.T. out of the woods, or only AT&T users being able to text American Idol votes.<br /><br />  * Coke is featured on American Idol 60% of the time<br /><br />  * Warnings on cigarette packs have no effect<br /><br />  * 8 out of 10 new products fail within 3 months<br /><br />Pros: Interesting, quick read<br /><br />Cons: He seems to have a big ego in that there's plenty of \"look what I did, designed, was involved with\" stuff in the book.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The author's heart is in the right place", "text": "The notion of a &quot;spine-tingler&quot; based upon the politicalminutiae surrounding a Presidential election is unusual, to be sure,and presents many possibilities in terms of character, plot, andideological theme.  Richard Warren Field has taken the field ofcontemporary American electoral politics and woven an interesting,though not terribly well-written tale of a third party candidacy thatthrows the historically curious American Electoral College-basedelectoral system into a veritable tizzy.  In presenting thehypothetical eco-leftist candidacy of one Michael Edwards, Field usesthe novel as a pulpit for the presentation of some interestingprogressive ideas, while simultaneously bringing to light some of the(many) flaws within the current electoral system.  If he actually werea novelist instead of an earnest reformer trying to &quot;spread theword&quot; using a literary form that clearly is difficult for him,the book would be more of a success.<br />In developing a&quot;page-turner&quot; about a hypothetical election, Field does hisbest to embellish his plot with suspense, skullduggery, and even onoccasion, sex.  Once the halfway point in the novel is reached, thingsbegin to move along quickly and entertainingly, and indeed, the bookin its final stages is hard to put down.  I also compliment Field forusing the novel as a kind of educational device regarding theElectoral College system and some other strange and often-arcaneaspects of the American approach to Presidential elections.  Finally,some of the ideas his upstart candidate preaches in his campaign arenoble and interesting, particularly those regarding the desirabilityof moving our society in a more ecologically responsible direction.In light of the current threats posed by global warming and (again)soaring energy prices, the need for a renewed commitment to renewableenergy and a less materially gluttonous lifestyle has never been moreapparent.<br />As a novel, however, *The Election* is not entirelysuccessful.  First of all, the characters are oppressively shallow andwooden, and the narration lacks any real litarary nuance ordescriptive depth. The strength of the book is in its messages, notits style of presentation.  Second, in order to make his &quot;thirdparty that catches fire&quot; theme at all plausible, Field needed tocreate a scenario in which the ecofriendly message of Michael Edwardswould suddenly seem significant enough to cause people to abandon the&quot;lesser of two evils&quot; mindset that has kept the vastmajority of voters attached to the two-party system for decades.Americans certainly are supportive overall of environmentalprotection, but from all indications, ecological issues simply are notamong the most significant issues that influence people's votes.  Thatthey could become so is certainly possible, but it would require somekind of threat or crisis (and likely one that includes a body count),and Field does not present any such scenario that would move &quot;theenvironment&quot; to the top of people's electoralagenda....<br />Overall, I salute Mr. Field for his dedication topossible significant change through the electoral system, and Irecommend the book to anyone who has ever fantasized about an electionshocker that would bring an eco-friendly administration into power.The cynic in me finds his scenario insufficiently plausible, butcertainly Field's heart is in the right place.

Scar's terrible rule was over.\"<br /><br />Disney makes many works of art that are crafted to speak to the audience. But this particular book represents all of the worst that Disney has to offer.

People who are complaining that the book is her blaming others for her mistakes may have missed the 90 times she blamed herself. She does talk about issues she had no control over but which still hurt her, though.  And that's fair.  One is the many unfair advantages men have over women in politics.

It's obvious Boone and Riley are a perfect match, but they don't know it yet. I liked Riley's college roommates and the uncommon bond between the four women. The connection and lifelong friendship among the SEALs seemed a bit unrealistic (they're the best of friends as children, all make it through BUD/s, and served in the same SEAL Team) but their bond is tight (very believable) and their determination to build a sustainable community was understandable. Though I have no interest in such things myself and I'm not an Austen Fan Girl (at least not to the extremes that Riley and her gal pals go to), the premise made the characters who they are. The story kept moving and I was sad to see it end.

It takes apart these parasites of cruelty who are largely without credentials in the fields they claim to be expert in, whose claim to scholarly pursuit is as fraudulent as the effluent that flows from their mouths, their books, and their advertisements.<br />This is also about men and women who produce The Historical Record with Scientific Exactitude, and who willingly modify that record when later evidence requires change. Mr. Michael Shermer and Mr. Alex Grobman are both Scholars and Historians who took years to document that which is accepted as truth by all but the mentally bent. Immanuel Khant knew how these deniers were made, these deniers of history when he said, \"Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made nothing entirely straight can be built\".<br />Deny the Holocaust. Deny the Sun rises and sets. Pathetic as the statement may be these thoughts and those who attempt to pedal their dementia are why their need to be constant reminders and a never-ending availability of books that keep Historical Atrocities current and relevant. It is also why we must always have Authors such as these who have the stamina to document what should require nothing other than acceptance. Why we need these men to sit across from other men while they ridicule a camp survivor who witnessed exactly what the deniers deny.<br />This truly is a remarkable exposition about how real History can be recorded and abused. It answers why the few on the fringe of their created fantasies cannot be ignored, but at the same time demonstrates that nothing requires morally or legally that they be helped to spread their lies. Their freedom to speak and write may cause nausea at the very least, however free speech does not require college newspapers to accept the ads the deniers produce.<br />I also admired the Authors for stepping outside the event that is so much a part of their lives, and to write at length of the Holocaust so well documented in the work, \"The Rape Of Nanking\". The Japanese Government has yet to claim full responsibility for the crimes that Japan committed in WW II. And then there is the Government of Turkey for the slaughter of Armenians and Pontic Greeks, The United State for the 400 years of genocide against Africans and African Americans, and the extermination attempted of The Native Americans. It was just a few months ago that then President Clinton intervened to stop a bill condemning the Turkish Government for continuing to deny their history.<br />I had the privilege to listen to and then speak with Mr. Randall Robinson, an African American, Scholar and Author, and Civil Rights Activist. One of the points he made that evening is that when any part of society denies the History of another group of its citizens, they damage themselves, not just those whose History they seek to deny. To steal, deny, or erase History is to do so for us all, to the detriment of all.<br />I have read dozens of books on this topic, and page for page this is as good as any.<br />We just never seem to learn............", "images": [], "asin": "0520216121", "parent_asin": "0520216121", "user_id": "AESXHXY257AGBUDJRGOPSQPZQC7A", "timestamp": 984191899000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I'm not pushing a book.  It can be gotten from the library, even on interlibrary loan, for free.  It's an excellent book - and contrary to bad reviews, there is no freaking porn in the book - it's even tamer than what Kim Harrison writes (Rachel Morgan series).  But the book IS excellent if one reads it carefully and looks up in a dictionary anything they aren't sure of.  I bemoan the fact that most readers of today, younger people especially, might not understand the times and what was considered \"the norm.\"<br /><br />We know from the series that, in the end, B realizes that he loves A and that he always loved A.  He tells her that, as she dies in his arms - she dies de-witched, fully human.  Yet,  in Descent, he recalls saying those words to her, he wonders why he felt it, said it, thought it.  He recalls what he despised about her - one of the things being her descent, parantage, etc. - things that would be of major importance to the aristocrat class or the gentleman class, at the time.  Gentleman was a class, contrary to lower class.  We see that B only even saw Josette once, J was wondering if he's even remember her face!  Throughout their courtship, approved since she was of the aristocratic class, they never even kissed!  Even then, B slaps A in the face with the class thing, bringing up \"officer and servant\" and insinuating that she's had sex with more men than just him (not so).  she rightly calls him a villian.  (Blackguard was the term back then). But read Angelique's Descent.<br /><br />Then listen to this audio play.<br /><br />Imo, J was an air-heady little \"doll\" that knew nothing of the world around her, pampered and spoiled to the max.  Angelique did not get in the way of true love, or harm it.  No.  The times, the morality of the day, the family obligations, the classism of the times, that got in the way of REAL TRUE LOVE, between Angelique and Barnabas.<br /><br />The mores of the times are crucial to understanding this love triangle.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Great biography of a strange but entertaining man", "text": "As a boy growing up in Santa Rosa, California, LeRoy Ripley was skinny and awkward.  The painfully shy young man had a talent for cartooning.  When he was nineteen, he left his hometown to draw for newspapers in San Francisco, but everyone he met advised him to move on to New York City.  In 1912, Ripley did, working as a sports journalist and cartoonist.  As the years passed, he began introducing little bits of sports trivia into his cartoons: fastest runners, records set and broken, and suchlike.  By the early 1920s, he was traveling the world and sending dispatches back to his New York papers featuring the strange and delightful wonders he saw on his adventures through Asia and Europe.  His columns and illustrations grew in popularity exponentially, so that by the early 1930s the eccentric cartoonist was one of the wealthiest men in his industry.  As he grew older, he continued to travel, collecting artifacts and unusual items from every corner of the globe.  Ripley's entertainment empire spread into books,\"odditoriums\" (a combination of museum of the weird and freak show), radio and even television.  Often imitated, never duplicated, Robert L. Ripley's life was as strange and unbelievable as the stories he collected.  Neal Thompson's biography of Ripley is the first written in over fifty years, and the only one written with access to the archives of Ripley Entertainment (including many of Ripley's personal papers) and the Doug and Hazel Storer Collection (both Storers were employees of Ripley for many years; Doug was his business manager).<br /><br />If you have ever had the experience of wandering through one of Ripley's Odditoriums, it is impossible not to wonder about the man who helped amass the vast collections.  The rooms are so incredibly random!  In one chamber, medieval instruments of torture are displayed - some are even demonstrated on wax models.  The next room might have the taxidermy remains of a pig with two heads, or the shoes of the world's tallest man.  Another room might have Noh masks from Japan or shrunken heads or bronze Yoruba sculptures.  It's utterly impossible to predict, especially since the collections continue to grow even now, sixty plus years after Ripley's death.<br /><br />Ripley is very much a man of his time, which is to say that things like political correctness wasn't a priority.  He was a very observant man, with great attention to detail when he drew historic costumes or portraits for the newspapers - but he was also a traveler who steadfastly refused to learn even a few words of the native tongue.  He was a lifelong bachelor, although he seemed to like women (especially Asian women).  Towards the end of his life, he was even a bit of a Hugh Hefner figure, always surrounded by beautiful women in his palatial homes and on his travels.  Thompson makes no attempt to hide Ripley's flaws, and it is perhaps because he has so many of them that he remains sympathetic.<br /><br />As he grows older, Ripley surrounds himself with stuff and people, but he remains the lonely man unable to fill an inner void.  He reminds me not of the great explorers like Mallory or Shackleton, but of Jay Gatsby, the flamboyantly wealthy party host that everybody knows but no one is close to.  Ripley also reminds me a bit of Walt Disney - both men were artists who created media empires by pushing their way to the top of their mediums; for Ripley this was the newspaper comic, while Disney became the king of animation.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading learning more about Ripley, since I've been to a couple of the Ripley's museums (in Los Angeles, CA and in Orlando, FL) and find it mind-boggling that someone would manage to accumulate so much stuff.  The biography humanized Ripley without painting over his obvious eccentricity, and it made me want to visit another of his Odditoriums.", "images": [], "asin": "077043620X", "parent_asin": "077043620X", "user_id": "AHX25MN3P7B6FZCQIZDBLBNIGKZQ", "timestamp": 1367980772000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Don't let the fringe scare you away from this!", "text": "Please bear with me, as I hop on my soap-box for a minute. I promise I'll review the book -<br /><br />WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?<br /><br />*ahem*, I'll try that again...<br /><br />First, let me get the AA piece out of the way. My name is Steve, and I am a Democrat. (\"Hi, Steve!\")<br /><br />Does that really even matter? No. It shouldn't. I'm not a Communist, Marxist, (yadda-yadda), but I have Democratic morals. So what, right? Here's my point - yes it IS possible to be a Democrat and still love this book. Why? Well because this is just FICTION. Yes, the future in this novel is bleak and scary, yes the political leanings in this book are certainly towards the right, yes some of the characters are racist - WHO CARES! This is still a very well-written book with tons of intrigue, mystery, the whole nine.<br /><br />Dan took what was in his mind a possible scenario, and wrote a fictional novel out of it set in a dystopian America. Authors have been doing this for years. This does NOT mean that Dan is a crazy, racist, wing-nut blah-blah-blah. If that were the case then the author of the dystopian work 'A Clockwork Orange', Anthony Burgess, is truly one sick puppy - but people still love his work! (myself being one of these people)<br /><br />Here's the problem: more and more people are polarized because of political differences. It's almost like religion to some people, so when someone comes up with an opposing viewpoint people get extremely 'butt-hurt' (sorry, not a tactful term, but accurate). So, if you are the type to get 'butt-hurt' over differing political ideals then this book is not for you - go back to reading dystopian works about anarchist children, serial rapists, etc. However, if you are able to set political differences aside and just enjoy a nice work of dystopian fiction, regardless if you're a Democrat or Republican, or in between, then by all means check this book out!<br /><br />I have been slammed defending this book by other reviewers in the comments of other reviews, essentially being called a DINO (Democrat In Name Only) just because I enjoyed this book. Odd that reviewers like these will then say 'Well, it's not the politics that bother me, it's that the writing is poor!'. Bull. If you weren't so 'butt-hurt' by the political aspects then why would the favorable opinion of mine, a Democrat, even matter to you! Gah! So frustrating! IT'S FICTION PEOPLE! People say 'Well, just read the first line in the book - that is proof that this book was written poorly!' Hey, how about reading the rest of the lines, eh? This book was NOT written poorly. I'm sure I could dig through any of Dan's books and find lines that aren't written perfectly. Who cares. By the way, the first sentence is \"'You're probably wondering why I asked you to come here today, Mr. Bottom' said Hiroshi Nakamura.\" (Ooh - the horror, right?)<br /><br />(Okay, breathe easy)<br /><br />Alright, I'm off the soap box now. So here's the review, as promised:<br /><br />Former Denver detective Nick Bottom lives in a very broken America. We have gone bankrupt. America has become ripe for the pickins for the Caliphate, Japanese, Mexicans, etc. Suicide bombings are common, stadiums are used to house prisoners, we are down to 44 states, our military has long been stretched WAY too thin. Essentially, we are helpless. Instead of trying to do something productive about it, most citizens have become addicted to a cheap drug called Flashback.<br /><br />Flashback is an interesting drug. This drug allows you to live vicariously through your former-self. You inhale the drug, focus on a memory and the drug will take you there, allowing you to relive that moment. You are still aware of your current-self while on the drug.<br /><br />Former detective Nick Bottom has lost his wife. Like many others, he is addicted to Flashback, which caused him to lose his job. Money is so hard to come by, which is doubly-painful when you have an addiction. A very powerful Japanese dignitary named Nakamura offers Nick enough money to feed his Flashback addiction for life if Nick can solve the murder of Nakamura's son. This seems like an impossible task, the case has been cold for six years and Nick wasn't able to solve it before - nobody can seem to solve it. Nick is also trying to solve the murder of his wife.<br /><br />Making matters worse, Nick's teenage son Val wants nothing to do with him. He lives with his Grandfather (Nick's father in-law) in California and he belongs to a flashgang. Flashgangs commit heinous crimes, and because they are twisted people they flash back to said crimes (rape, murder, etc).<br /><br />That's about as much as I'm going to give away as far as plot.<br /><br />This book, like the drug, is ADDICTING! For a Simmons novel this one moves incredibly brisk. Little-by-little the mystery moves closer to resolution as we see the story unfold from a couple different angles. One thread follows Nick, another his son Val. Simmons leaves little cliffhangers throughout making it downright impossible to put down at times.<br /><br />Okay, there is a little bit of beef, so I couldn't give it the full five stars...<br /><br />Many of the characters aren't fleshed out as well as those found in Simmons' other work. I wouldn't go as far as to say they are 'cardboard' or whatever, but this is no Carrion Comfort, which has AMAZING characters. Also, though the end is good, it doesn't quite meet the potential it had given how intriguing the rest of the story is. There are also a couple areas that seem a little too 'convenient', but it is rare, and I don't want to go into those for risk of spoiling important plot elements. The problem is that Simmons puts himself on his own scale - it's hard to give this one a five when he has such jaw-dropping books under his belt like Hyperion and Carrion Comfort. That being said, this book is still good. Very good.<br /><br />So, if you can get over the political aspects of this book then certainly check it out. I actually found the political aspects interesting, even if my own political beliefs don't align with those in this book. Besides, over 90% of this book surrounds the murder mystery, this isn't \"pages and pages of extreme right-wing rhetoric\" like many reviewers are trying to lead you to believe.

{"rating": 4, "title": "A harrowing and honest self-examination", "text": "Dwight \"Doc\" Gooden's memoir about his history of drug and alcohol abuse is a harrowing tale that pulls no punches. I knew that Gooden had struggled with his addictions, but until I read this book, I didn't realize just how bad his addictions were (Gooden only became truly clean and sober two years ago). So many celebrity autobiographies attempt to whitewash bad deeds and pass off blame on others. Gooden, however, takes responsibility for his actions and makes no excuses for himself.<br /><br />Gooden's baseball days are a very small part of this memoir. In fact, his discussion of his career is merely part of the setting for the larger narrative of how he sank into the depths of addiction and then slowly (very slowly) made his way back to sobriety. If you are looking for a book that goes into Gooden's pitching career in great detail, then this isn't the book for you.<br /><br />The memoir is relentless in showing Gooden's numerous binges, half-hearted attempts at rehabilitation, run-ins with the law, and his family and friends' desperate attempts to help him get sober. At the midpoint of the memoir, the reader begins to wonder how Gooden managed to survive his addictions. Gooden recounts with brutal honesty how his substance abuse cost him his career, two marriages, his relationships with his children, his money, and, ultimately, his freedom when he was sent to prison. To his credit, Gooden is brutally honest about himself and shows that while he is basically a good person, he did some awful things to himself and those who loved and cared for him.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Well-paced Suspense Novel Told in Dual Timelines", "text": "I can't imagine reading All The Dangerous Things by Stacy Willingham as a mother of little children! It was hard enough as a grandmother of very young children.<br /><br />The premise: Isabelle Drake is living a parent's worst nightmare. Her toddler son Mason was taken from his crib in the middle of the night while she and her husband slept in the room next door.  The police investigation found no answers, and a year later, Isabelle's life is falling apart. Her husband left her, she literally can't sleep, and her sole focus is desperately searching for information about Mason and his abductor.  The story is told with extensive flashbacks to Isabelle's childhood with her parents and sister which add a second mystery to the plot.<br /><br />Reading Willingham's newest suspense novel annually in January is a welcome change from the sweet and sentimental novels I tend to read in December. I don't read a lot of suspense/thrillers, but I liked A Flicker in the Dark last January and this title as well.  This had a strong sense of place in both storylines, and the visits to Isabelle's childhood and the pacing made this unique for me.

{"rating": 5, "title": "A treasure trove...", "text": "For some reason, I have always had a fascination with obituaries and I believe they include some of the best writing to be found in newspapers.  I jumped at the opportunity to order The New York Times Book of the Dead: 320 Print and 10,000 Digital Obituaries of Extraordinary People, edited by William McDonald.  This book is a treasure trove and a look back at the lives of many important people extending over 100 years.<br /><br />The Book of the Dead is divided into sections including The World Stage, American Leaders, Warriors, The Old West, Stage and Screen, and the Literary World\u2014to mention just a few.  Many are individuals who died before I was even born.  Some are people that I don\u2019t remember having died.  Where can you find a book that includes death notices of notable people from Otto Von Bismarck to Satchel Paige to Frank Sinatra? What makes these obituaries especially enjoyable and thought provoking are the little gems you can find in them.  The Times doesn\u2019t sugar-coat circumstances and situations\u2014even if some believe that you shouldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead.  Mel Gussow writes of Tennessee Williams \u201cHe produced an enormous body of work, including more than two dozen full-length plays, all of them produced, a record unequaled by any of his contemporaries.  There were successes and failures, and often great disagreement over which was which.\u201d  About Marlon Brandon, Rick Lyman writes \u201c\u201dhe was brooding, muscular and intense.  Detractors called him a slob.  He appeared in tight blue jeans and torn T-shirts, grimy with sweat, alternately slack-jawed with stupidity and alive with feral cunning.  And he was more openly sexual, in an animal way, than the actors who immediately proceeded him\u201d<br /><br />My one complaint about The Book of the Dead is that this book is a monster.  At 12\u201d by almost 8\u201d and weighing maybe 4 pounds, it\u2019s not the kind of book you can read propped up in bed.  But at least you can read a few obits at a sitting and not have to tackle the entire book at once.  Also, while I read all 320 obituaries listed in the book, I have yet to read the 10,000 digital death notices that are on the included in the web key.<br /><br />I have a feeling that The Book of the Dead will be a book that will become a handy reference book that I will come back to again and again.", "images": [], "asin": "0316395471", "parent_asin": "0316395471", "user_id": "AFI7YILO4JRFKRXQXGDBHDIYZVVQ", "timestamp": 1485359914000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "A Terrific Sense of Place & Time", "text": "Bruce Machart's \"The Wake of Forgiveness\" tells the story of a rebellious son born to a mother who dies during his birth.  The book is set in three time periods (1895, 1910, and 1924) and starts with the birth of Karel Skala and the death of his mother Klara.  Klara's death sets the father of Karel (and three other sons) reeling.  He takes to drink, gambles, and is basically a lousy and overbearing presence in the life of the boys.  The story then jumps to 1910 and a bet on a horse race and moves to 1924 to Karel as an adult still struggling with the loss of his mother, a girl, and the difficulty of dealing with his brothers and father.  Machart jumps back in forth between events in 1910 and 1924 with great success as he tells this story of marginal redemption.<br /><br />The author does a great job of evoking time (early 20th century) and place (Texas).  He's got a good story and he tells it well.  On the down side, none of the characters is remotely likable (with the possible exception of a nursemaid or the dead mother, neither of whom plays much of a role in this book).  There are few redeeming qualities to any of the characters and although the reader might find some redemption along the way, the story is not very uplifting.  Still, it's a beautifully written book and even features some references to Shiner beer.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Twisted, demented, and thoroughly engrossing!", "text": "The title of this book is a perfect representation of what\u2019s between the pages. It is twisted, horrifying, raw, and it shines a light into all those dark corners we all want to pretend don\u2019t exist. Oh, but they do.<br /><br />The story is told in two timelines, the present day and 1985, when Ben Day murdered his mother and two sisters, leaving Libby the sole survivor besides Ben himself. Not surprisingly, Libby\u2019s life has been anything but idyllic.<br /><br />Libby\u2019s character is interesting, although I know a lot of readers may not connect with her. She\u2019s imperfect, with qualities that, on the surface, may be unlikable. Does she do things that would be easy to condemn? Absolutely, but there\u2019s still something about her that makes you care, makes you understand why she is the way she is. Even before the murder of her family, Libby\u2019s life was difficult. The added trauma at such a young change has irrevocably changed her. To me, that makes her sympathetic. This is a girl who\u2019s grown into womanhood alone, with little to no real support. She\u2019s lost, alone, completely unprepared for life. It made me feel for her, to want more for her, even if she is a bit on the emotionally deranged side.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I had all kinds of theories as to where the story was leading. But I was wrong every single time. The book is deliciously demented in so many ways. There are times when the story edges toward unbelievable, yet even in those moments, it\u2019s entirely imaginable.

Very much a Lancashire lad (Wigan, as he reminds us) he has not lost his roots, and has a pleasing down to earth quality in his writing. Thoughtful, intelligent, warm, humorous, this also shows a lively interest in people in all their diversity.<br /><br />In the wake of last year\u2019s referendum, Maconie, like many of us, found himself musing on our divided nation. Connections between the 1930\u2019s and the present seemed to be suggesting themselves, as right wing, populist politics, divisive and suspicious of outsiders, seemed on the rise<br /><br />2016 was the 80th anniversary of the 1936 Jarrow March/Jarrow Crusade, occasioned by the closure of the single employer on which all else depended, the steelworks. Unemployment was rising in the country, and the gaps between rich and poor, South and North, were obvious. 200 men set out to march to London to deliver a petition to Parliament. Jarrow captured the public imagination, and the March has become a legend of dignity,resistance and solidarity on the one hand and uncaring capitalism on the other, a divided nation<br /><br />Maconie, a keen walker, decided to emulate the 300 mile journey made by the Marchers, following their daily itinerary, \u2018visiting the same towns and comparing the two Englands of then and now\u2019<br /><br />Some of the parallels were very clear:<br /><br />\u201cThe rise of extremism here and abroad fired by financial disasters, a wave of demagoguery and \u2018strong man\u2019 populism. Foreign wars driven by fundamentalist ideologies leading to the mass displacement of innocent people. A subsequent refugee \u2019crisis\u2019. The threat of constitutional anarchy with conflict between government, parliament and judiciary. Manufacturing industries, especially steel, facing extinction\u2026.Inflammatory rhetoric stoked by a factionalised press\u2026\u2026.A country angrily at odds with itself over its relationship to Europe, the elephant in the nation: Brexit\u2019<br /><br />This is far more than a purely personal story of one man\u2019s walk. Maconie engages with the people he meets, garners stories of then and now, recounts the history of the places he travels through,, whilst following some of his own interests, football, music \u2013 of all kinds, and finding, often conviviality and hospitality around food, reflecting the cultures who have added, across the centuries, to the rich loam of this island .<br /><br />This is an engaging, fascinating account, sometimes angry, often scathing about those whose manipulations fostered the divisions and uncertainties we now face, populists of the right and of the left. What stands out, again and again, is the richness of a culture, in this country, which has always been eclectic, fed by generations of \u2018outsiders\u2019 across the centuries, settling, marrying, having children who have feet in the history and culture of the new homeland, and influences from the old. \u2018 Britishness\u2019 develops, as it always has<br /><br />In some ways  this reminds me, in the serious things it is saying, of Joe Bagent\u2019s 2008 [[ASIN:0307339378 Deer Hunting with Jesus: Dispatches from America's Class War]], which looks at the rise of support for the Republican Party which came from those who might have been expected to find the Democrats their home.<br /><br />This is cultural and social history as I prefer it \u2013 humanly, rather than statistically explored, entertaining whilst informing.<br /><br />I was delighted to be offered this as an ARC, from the publishers via NetGalley, and thoroughly enjoyed this 300 mile walk, with no blisters, and in totally clement weather", "images": [], "asin": "1785030531", "parent_asin": "1785030531", "user_id": "AGIELHWW62QLOWY4ODQIOOZNHKPA", "timestamp": 1500572713999, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Culture Clash", "text": "A Lady Cyclist's Guide to Kashgar opens with an immediately engrossing scene. Three lady missionaries come upon a young girl in labor. Villages are afraid or unwilling to help the pregnant girl, a child herself, so the missionary ladies step in. The baby is born, the new mother dies, and the missionary ladies are led away to be charged with murder.<br /><br />At this point, I expected to love this book.<br /><br />The missionaries are Eva, our narrator; her sister Lizzie and an older woman called Millicent. The mission to Kashgar is really Millicent's project, for reasons of her own that aren't necessarily Gospel-based. Lizzie just wants to take photos and be with Millicent, and Eva wants to look after Lizzie. Since missionary work doesn't appeal to Eva, she's faking that bit. Her goals for the trip have more to do with her newfangled bicycle, and the journal she's keeping in hopes of publishing a guide for tourists traveling on these exciting new machines.<br /><br />Juxtaposed with events in Kashgar is the story of Frieda, a young woman in present day who has struggled to make her own life the opposite of her commune-dwelling, free-spirited mother's. Instead, Frieda finds herself somewhat tangled between her married lover and a new friendship with an illegal immigrant who's begun camping on her doorstep.<br /><br />I disliked Frieda, and thought her sections of the book were predictable and only served to break up the more interesting goings on in Kashgar. After dragging out Eva's naivete for most of the book, the ending rushed by in a blur, leaving the reader to piece together events from a few lines in quoted letters.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Wise Insight Into How to Obey the Ten Commandments", "text": "Jen Wilkin has a talent for explaining ancient commandments in the Bible in everyday language. The Ten Commandments look simple on the surface, but it is easy to break them without actually meaning to. A lot of people use God's name in vain when they swear and worship other gods by giving worldly things a higher priority than God. And coveting other people's possessions and lives is a national sport.<br /><br />Jen Wilkin explains all the background before The Ten Commandments were given. Then she delves into commentary chapter by chapter, one commandment at a time. For anyone seeking to understand the full dimensions of each commandment, this is truly edifying and educational.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />How were the ten plagues in Egypt related to the gods they worshiped? (Very interesting!)<br />What is double-mindedness?<br />How can we truly rest on the Sabbath?<br />What is the real reason we should not lust or covet?<br />What should we seek to put to death in our thought life?<br />How can we honor our fellow humans?<br /><br />Jen Wilkin has an excellent intellectual grasp of the concepts in the Bible and her heart is in the right place. She combines her astounding knowledge of biblical principles with practical applications for today. Some of her thoughts are absolutely enlightening in a spiritual sense. She really gets that humans are required to honor and respect other image bearers \u2013 our fellow travelers on this earth.<br /><br />This book gives you a lot to think about and addressing issues presented will help you become more sanctified and live in God's will. Jen Wilkin provides wise insights into how Christians can obey the Ten Commandments on a daily basis. I will however say that wanting to obey is probably based on how much you love God to begin with. The more you love God the more you will want to do what he says to do. That is key!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "images": [], "asin": "1433566346", "parent_asin": "1433566346", "user_id": "AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA", "timestamp": 1614658810547, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 4, "title": "Light Vampire Fare with a twist.", "text": "Read from November 19 to 22, 2012<br /><br />  Book Synopsis<br /><br />Mother, wife, private investigator ... and vampire. Six years ago, federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home. Then the unthinkable happened, an attack that changed her life forever. And forever is a very long time for a vampire.<br /><br />Samantha's adventures as a night-roaming vampire and private investigator in Samantha Moon include ...<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #1) Moon Dance:<br /><br />Samantha is hired by Kingsley Fulcrum to investigate the attempt on his life, a horrific scene watched on TV around the country. But Kingsley isn't exactly what he appears to be; after all, there is a reason why he survived five shots to the head.<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #2) Vampire Moon:<br /><br />Samantha Moon hunts down a powerful crime lord and protects an innocent woman from her ruthless ex-husband--all while two very different men vie for her heart. As the stakes grow higher and her cases turn personal, Samantha Moon will do whatever it takes to protect the innocent and bring two cold-blooded killers to justice--her own brand of justice.<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #3) American Vampire:<br /><br />Samantha receives a heartbreaking call from a very unlikely source: a five-year-old girl who's been missing for three months. Using her considerable resources--including her growing supernatural abilities--to locate the missing girl before it's too late, Samantha also receives devastating news on the home front, forcing her to make the ultimate choice of life and death.<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #4) Moon Child:<br /><br />Samantha Moon is faced with an impossible decision that will change her life and those of the ones she loves forever--a decision that no mother should ever have to make. And through it all, Samantha finds herself in a lethal game of vampire versus vampire as a powerful and desperate enemy will stop at nothing to claim what he most desires.<br /><br />Christmas Moon:<br /><br />With Christmas just around the corner, Samantha takes on a very strange case: A priceless family treasure has been stolen, something passed down through the generations and buried in secrets. And Samantha gets half of whatever it is ... if she can find it first.<br /><br />... and an all-new Samantha Moon short story by J.R. Rain<br /><br />  My Thoughts<br /><br />Having spent several days with Samantha Moon reading about her as she evolves over 4 short stories in the series and 2 shorter novellas has been an interesting experience.<br /><br />Samantha takes on cases ranging from investigating attempted murder, to bringing killers to justice with her own brand of retaliation, to finding a kidnapped child and breaking up what turns out to be a blood harvesting ring. Along the way her marriage breaks up, her husband refuses to allow her to be alone with her son and daughter and only limited phone contact, she then finds herself being wooed by multiple admirers and is confused by the attention more than actually flattered, she also has to deal with the sudden surge in strength of her vampire induced powers and for a woman alone who at any given moment has too many irons in the fire but manages to admirably continue to strive to be a good parent, keep her baser instincts under control as well as keep her PI investigations on track.<br /><br />This is one of those character driven reads where the reader either really enjoys the main character and their personality or is turned off by them and cannot connect. I love Samantha, she is a strong lady who is not afraid to try to make life as good as possible despite her being attacked years ago and becoming one of the undead. She loves her children fiercely and will do anything for them to keep them safe and take care of them no matter what anyone else wants. Samantha is also humorous with a sense of the macabre in her humor that lends itself well to the stories.<br /><br />The secondary characters introduced into each of the books are also fun to follow, the lawyer Kingsley Fulcrum who is her first client in book 1 is an ongoing part of the series and as one learns more about him he becomes someone you either want to hit over the head or hug depending on what scene he is in.<br /><br />Second and more interesting is Samantha's online friend Fang, when his true identity is revealed and his physical attributes are described the reader will be as delighted as Samantha!<br /><br />The 4th book in the series is the one that will break your heart and leave you speechless, Sam is forced into a decision that no Mother should ever have to face and she makes the right choice in my mind. However as with all choices there are consequences and repurcussions but in the end everything turns out fine.<br /><br />The two short novellas add to Samantha's list of persons she finds intriguing and also allow a little more insight into who she was prior to her attack and what she is slowly realizing she is becoming.<br /><br />Throughout this entire collection the reader is going to laugh, cry, sigh with disappointment, react violently to the actions taken by Sam's ex-husband Danny (who I personally would love to bludgeon with a blunt object!) and have a hard time letting go when the books are finished.<br /><br />I really wish to thank the author J.R. Rain for providing us with such an entertaining collection of stories and plan to someday continue with the rest of the series.<br /><br />  [EARC via Netgalley from BenBella books in exchange for an honest review.]", "images": [], "asin": "1937856178", "parent_asin": "1937856178", "user_id": "AGR4V67NQMGIWTESVZZYT4WMK5MA", "timestamp": 1354299408000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

The Browns life is more complicated than most, following the recent loss of an infant child.<br /><br />Amy's burgeoning relationship with the Browns and their daughter forms the center of the events that follow.<br /><br />All of the main characters in this book are significantly flawed. By the book's end, none seem to make any real progress in understanding their flaws (or act in a way that's surprising enough to offer a payoff for sticking through the novel-length exploration of their actions).<br /><br />Mixed in the narrative of Esther and the Browns is a second tale, \"Pandas in Narnia\". Presented as the residue of writing project from Esther's college days, presumably it's supposed to work on an allegorical level. If so, the allegory was lost on me.<br /><br />This is better than some other recent first novels I've read. Stein has presented us with an entertaining and funny protagonist..who doesn't morph much beyond this.

Since then, most of Bourne\u2019s residents have come down with or been born with health problems, including the Mitchell triplets, who refer to themselves in birth order number, which also corresponds to the number of syllables in their names. Mab, or One, is a \u201cnormal\u201d sixteen-year-old girl. She\u2019s on the track for high-achieving kids at school. Monday, or Two, is on the autism spectrum. When the town library closed, she took custody of the books, which are now crammed in every nook and cranny of their house. She knows the exact location of every single one though. Mirabel, or Three, has what appears to be cerebral palsy, although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever specifically stated. She is in a wheelchair and has the use of just one arm and hand. She uses a voice machine to communicate.<br /><br />The triplets\u2019 father, who worked in the chemical plant, died of cancer before they were born. Their mother Nora has been trying to get a class-action lawsuit going against Belsum ever since. Then one day, Nathan Templeton, the son of Belsum\u2019s founder, comes to town promising a new beginning. But can he and Belsum be trusted?<br /><br />One Two Three alternates between the first-person perspectives of the three girls. Each has a distinctive voice and their own fully developed personality. It\u2019s a heavy story but there is some humor as well. Especially from Monday, who is endearing, yet frustrating in the way that overly literal people often are. Mirabel, because she has been an observer of people for her whole life, is wise beyond her years.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Second City Mayhem ...", "text": "More often than not, the city of Chicago always seems to take a back seat to all things New York and Los Angeles.  With his CITY OF SCOUNDRELS, author Gary Krist details an eerie 12-day period of time in July 1919 when the \"Second City\" almost imploded following a series of subsequent disasters.  Chock full of details and told in manner that gives readers an eye-witness perspective at street level, CITY OF SCOUNDRELS sheds light on how the nation's second largest city survived a momentary descent into the darkness of total chaos.<br /><br />Amid the sweltering heat of July in 1919, simmering tensions beneath the city's bustle and relative calm were brought to a head by a bizarre, chain-reaction of calamitous events:  an aerial disaster, the murder of a child, a massive transit strike and one of the worst race-riots in the American history.  Making matters worse, the city's leadership at the time was deeply embroiled in its own political turmoil.<br /><br />Krist takes readers on a progressive whirlwind tour of simultaneous, escalating events without losing focus in the process.  Starting with the crash/explosion of a blimp, he uses the event to segue into the fragile racial balance that has been rocked by numerous bombings.  With the blimp crash and racial issues still fresh in our minds, he introduces us to the disappearance and subsequent murder of a child that creates even more public outrage.  As these intial small crises begin to build, Krist reminds us that in the background, the city is run by a stereotypical fat-cat mayor, William \"Big Bill\" Thompson, whose political goals often come at the expense of his constituents.  Krist details the unholy matrimony that exists between Thompson and an erudite, political puppet-master, Fred Lundin, as well as their plans to use Chicago as Thompson's stepping-stone to the US Presidency.  With the fires of the blimp crash, crumbling race-relations and the nonsensical murder of a child smoldering in our minds, we are reminded of the ill-effects Prohibition was having on Chicago, as well as its struggle to recover from a war-time economy.  With all components already in place for the perfect storm, a mass transit strike occurs only to be followed by a race-related murder that sparks a one of the nation's worst race riots.  The worst case scenario has occurred and the mayor is \"asleep at the wheel.\"  As the rage within the city slowly begins to lose steam (with the unrequested assistance of the Illinois State militia), the city manages to survive the storm, but political careers are forever damaged.<br /><br />I found CITY OF SCOUNDRELS both educational and lively, mainly due to the manner in which it was written.  Gary Krist deftly outlines a wide-range of events with crisp detail (enough to generate the feeling of seeing them first-hand), but the reader never gets lost in the story.  I feel this can be attributed to the author's knack of returning to each event in a timely manner and coherently managing to tie them all together.  I was left with feeling that no story was left untold and each storyline had closure.  I also appreciate the way CITY OF SCOUNDRELS made me take an interest in a period of time that I previously felt no particular desire to explore ... the 12 days of labor that contributed to the birth of modern Chicago.", "images": [], "asin": "0307454290", "parent_asin": "0307454290", "user_id": "AGNLRIXUGGGR4E47KQDGWOG6ZGMQ", "timestamp": 1332780286000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Plus, it also made me laugh... a lot :D<br /><br />I really liked the relationship between Tara and Flynn. And while some might think that things between them happened a little too fast, I didn't care...I loved it!<br /><br />There was action from start to finish, and it was a pretty quick read.

Frankie is the eldest sister and has all of the material things that she could possibly want; it's her love life that's lacking.  Having no success meeting men in any of the conventional ways, she resorts to seeking love over the Internet.  What follows is a series of disappointing dates, leaving Frankie to wonder if she will ever find her soulmate.<br />Livvy, the middle sister, is dealing with the infidelity of her husband--and the possible lifelong ramifications from the affair.  Angry, she turns to the Internet looking for answers, and finds a man whose wife has also betrayed him.  The result is a hot, torrid affair with someone who appears to be wonderful.  But things are never as they seem......<br />Tommie is the youngest sister, who continues to recover from an abusive relationship--and she has the physical scars to prove it.  Celibate for two years, she cannot deny the attraction she feels for her neighbor, Blue--who is also 16 years her senior, with a young child and plenty of baby momma drama.  Not to mention the fact that he is one of sister Frankie's tenants.....<br />There's plenty of action in this latest EJD addition.  Frankie finally stops looking for Mr. Right in all of the wrong places, Livvy's affair with an equally married man explodes in her face in ways you would never imagine, and Tommie realizes that love can be had in a man called Blue--despite the age difference.<br />Pick up the book and read it under your tree...thanks for the gift, Mr. Dickey!", "images": [], "asin": "0525947760", "parent_asin": "0525947760", "user_id": "AHCI37PD33CY6T7L5ERKHWKKFTIQ", "timestamp": 1070316950000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "A True Classic in the YA Genre", "text": "There aren't many people out there who haven't read Lois Lowry's classic, The Giver, but I happened to be one of them. Then I talked to my longtime friend (since 2nd grade!) who I often share great YA titles with (and a love for cheesy RomComs) and she told me The Giver was a book that she read in middle school that stayed with her. She still thought about the book 20 years later (god we are getting old). So, I decided I had to quit being a turd and do my YA collection justice with this 1994 Newberry winner. After finishing it in one voracious sitting, I had to ask myself if I would ever learn. I avoided Percy Jackson for years- did I learn? I refused to read Harry Potter, Twilight, and so many more for no other reason than they were popular. Now The Giver. Will I ever learn?! Why do I deprive myself of great stories?<br /><br />The story begins in a utopia. No one feels pain, no one is unhappy. Any feelings of anger, jealousy or concern are to be voiced in family units every morning in order to address and release them. Children are not born and raised with their parents. Instead, a sensible couple the community puts together is allowed to ask for children and they can receive up to one boy and one girl. Only Birth Mothers are allowed to have children, but since all the community members take drugs to inhibit sexual impulses from the time they reach puberty, no one seems to object. When people get too old, they are \"Released\" into a better state. If twins are born, the smaller of the two will be released. Even careers are not chosen, but rather given to the people of the community by the Elders after careful consideration. When children reach their twelfth year, they are assigned a career to focus on. Although they can request a career change, it doesn't happen. Instead, people are content in the community. They contribute, they live, and they are content. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br /><br />When Jonas reaches his twelfth year and is assigned, however, it changes everything. Jonas is assigned as the new Receiver of Memory. He is to report to the Giver of Memory, an old man who was chosen as Jonas was chosen, to be given the memories of times forgotten. This includes happy memories, like snow, sledding, warm sun, and fun. It also includes bad memories like pain, breaking an arm, war, and anger. These memories begin to change Jonas, but he is forbidden to share them with others. All he wants to do is show his sister and his friends the colors of the world, the sunshine.<br /><br />When his father, a Nurturer in the nursery, brings home a baby who isn't sleeping well, Jonas takes him into his bedroom at night and shares the happy memories with him. This soothes the baby, but is strictly forbidden, of course. Jonas and the Giver begin talking about leaving the community in order to give the people back the memories of past times, good and bad. It will be traumatic for them, but The Giver will be there to guide them. When Jonas's father announces the baby is going to be \"released\", Jonas, who has seen what \"releasing\" really is, refuses to leave the baby to that fate.<br /><br />This story is one that will truly rock your world. With so many dystopias swirling around out there, it is hard to imagine one that could sweep you off your feet as easily as this one. Nevertheless, this classic bested me. It makes the reader question their wants, their desires, their hopes. It keeps the reader on their toes and examines what is really important in life. Do we need a life free of pain and suffering? Or will that lead to the loss of all this beautiful, wonderful, and sublime as well. Do we need to experience pain in order to truly know love and happiness when we have it?<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone who hasn't read it already. Recently a coworker said she was using it in her middle school Lit class, and I was thrilled! (eerily she told me about using it in her classroom the very same day I finished reading it!) To hand this story over to students, especially in a student-driven setting, means opening the door to struggling readers who can't get enough of a story. This will be that story- it will have them questioning everything they have ever known, and then some. And isn't that why we read anyway? To question ourselves, our worlds, what we know, what we think we want to know, and so much more? Don't be afraid to give this story to your children or students- like my grade school friend, they will never forget it!", "images": [], "asin": "0395645662", "parent_asin": "0395645662", "user_id": "AGQLIVRC4THQRBQB2UG2V4WYCJQA", "timestamp": 1364042741000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

She also spoke out against Warren Jeffs who had taken over as the living Prophet of the sect. Her ex-husband Merril sued for custody which he lost and also owed thousands in child support which he did not pay. He was  imprisoned with Jeffs for his crimes. Caroline is an amazingly strong selfless woman who sought a better life for her own children and all the victims of the sect.

This first-in-series book kicks off with some interesting and multi-dimensional characters, Detective Inspector Moses Glynn and Detective Constable Juliette Rock, getting their inaugural case assignment with Division 43, a little known but well-equipped and high-powered intelligence branch of the police charged with investigating and squelching corruption at whatever level it is found.  As would be expected when two people of dissimilar backgrounds and experiences are thrown together and tasked with achieving a specific goal, differences of opinion are inevitable and frequent.  Against this backdrop of a new and unfamiliar work environment, a burgeoning new partnership, and each detective\u2019s personal life issues, a complex case unfolds involving murder and police corruption on a mind-blowing scale.  This story offers some amazing action, an original and meticulously cultivated plot, captivating twists and turns, and uncommonly vivid character development all while delivering a gritty and provocative police procedural which kept me turning pages late into the night.  I loved that the author was able to convey a rather convoluted plot in such a way that it flowed smoothly and was easy to follow despite its complexity.  I think the story and writing style will appeal to fans of Michael Connelly and James Patterson and I know I will certainly be eagerly anticipating more adventures with these remarkable and memorable characters.<br /><br />I was provided with an advance copy of this book and I am voluntarily offering my honest and unbiased review.", "images": [], "asin": "1913239284", "parent_asin": "1913239284", "user_id": "AHGGGBXEXMK7JABWORIZIGXRLRNQ", "timestamp": 1592364324721, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Making a Film or Video? Make It \"Sticky\" with \"Lean Forward Moments\"", "text": "Humans love stories. We'll stop what we're doing to be an audience for a good story.  But what makes a story good?  Norman Hollyn offers some important clues for making a story come alive on the screen - whether it's a theater screen or a small netbook screen.<br /><br />Hollyn teaches his readers to focus on details, the details that make the difference between a good story and a big yawn.  How can a film show character, conflict, emotion, with more than just words?  Hollyn shows how he does it, how the great directors have done it.  He illustrates how the smallest detail can reinforce or destroy the mood of the story the videographer is attempting to create.<br /><br />Where are these details?  They appear throughout the entire process,<br /><br /> in the logline,<br /> the writing,<br /> the background and other production elements,<br /> the directing and cinematography, and<br /> the editing.<br /><br />Maybe, although you've seen great films all your life, you've not been aware of the tiny (and not so tiny) details that lead you to a specific emotional state.  Hollyn brings these details into your awareness and shows you how they work together to create a great story.<br /><br />So how do his lessons apply in the chaotic world of video where creation and uploading can happen with hours, even minutes?  Making videos people want to watch, want to learn from is a matter of careful planning and attention to detail of storyline, theme. and mood.  Most of the videos that languish unappreciated lack his focus and attention, lack a clear direction with cinematic elements that support rather than distract from the message.<br /><br />After reading this book, slowly savoring it, I will never again watch a film without at least minimal awareness of the cinematic elements used to create and reinforce a mood, and to draw me to the edge of my seat with a \"lean forward moment.\" And, after reading it, I've got a much better idea of how to create videos with \"lean forward moments.\"<br /><br />Highly recommended  - this book has a permanent spot in my library", "images": [], "asin": "0321585453", "parent_asin": "0321585453", "user_id": "AGMVZOQA2BL3IFNIKW76523RM6ZQ", "timestamp": 1235256144000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

She fell in love with her bestfriend's brother, Nate and thought she would finally have her happy family but when he broke up with her she ran away with Cliff, a famous chef. They married but life was anything but easy as Cliff was a serial cheater and lived for the limelight which she hated. A year after divorcing Cliff, she watches the devastating news that he was killed in a car accident and that a pregnant young woman was with him.<br /><br />Ashley grew up with a \"dad\" she adored who passed away. She and her mom work hard to make ends meet but when her mom gets deathly ill, she reveals who Ashley's real dad is. Ashley is stunned and after her mother's passing does everything she can to meet her father including climbing in a car to have a conversation with him. She wakes up in a hospital and Cliff's ex-wife is there to whisk her away from the cameras and media. She is stunned by the generosity.<br /><br />Mel is hurt and angry when her bestfriend breaks her twin brother's heart and leaves town.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Full of tasty oatmeal recipes!", "text": "I first heard about Jenny Grothe in a recent issue of _Muscle and Fitness Hers_ magazine, where she had written an article with several really good recipes in it.  The byline mentioned her book, but when I came here to Amazon to order it, I was a bit reluctant to do so at first since many of the reviewers only have one review -- which always makes me a bit nervous since when I notice this, I worry that the reviewers are friends of the author.  I decided to take the plunge anyways, and am glad I did.  This book has over 75 recipes for oatmeal in it, and all are delicious.<br /><br />I love oatmeal so this book was right up my alley, but it has such tasty recipes in it that I can see non-oatmeal-lovers enjoying it, too.  Most of the recipes focus on baked oatmeals, but there are also a few recipes for pancakes and bars thrown in, as well as recipes that call for other grains such as quinoa and muesli.<br /><br />To give you an idea of what the recipes involve, they include ones like Black Forest Backed Oatmeal, Cinnamon Chocolate Chip Baked Oatmeal, and Key Lime Baked Oatmeal.  The variety of recipes really does cover every palette, and they mostly call for simple ingredients that one might already have on hand or that are easy to find.<br /><br />The prep time for each baked oatmeal recipe is minimal (less than five minutes), and each requires about 30 minutes of baking time.<br /><br />I like, too, how this book starts with Jenny's own story of weight loss; it's very inspirational and motivating, and Jenny seems very sweet.<br /><br />Also, although this book is small, almost every recipe has a full-color photograph, which I enjoy seeing in cookbooks.  (The book might even be self-published and could have benefited from an editor to help catch typos, but those don't bother me since the recipes themselves are so good.)  Overall, this is a great book to add to one's clean-eating collection!  I hope she writes another cookbook soon!<br /><br />UPDATE ON 7/30/11: I ordered this larger-sized ramekin [[ASIN:B00080QKKQ CorningWare French White 24-Ounce Round Dish]] and it works perfectly for all these recipes. The plastic lid also makes storing leftover baked oatmeals a breeze.<br /><br />Although Amazon does carry a sampler pack of some sugar-free Torani syrups, they weren't the flavors that were most called for by this book.

{"rating": 4, "title": "Excellent introduction, but incomplete.", "text": "This is a first-rate introduction to CVS.  In fact, it may be that everything you ever need to know about CVS is in this book.  This book covers version control basics, paradigm differences, branches, merging, and all of the 'basic' version control tools.  It then provides 'recipes' (boiler plate) for common operations to simplify things.  This book has perhaps two shortcomings: first, it doesn't cover all of the features of CVS.  The authors can be forgiven for stating their prejudices, particularly since they coincide with mine, but I think completeness is worth something so ignoring the features that are deemed of less worth is probably not the best. Second, this book doesn't cover the GUI interfaces.  The GUI's should be easy to figure out, and the command line is certainly where it's at for scripting, but I think there are a lot of folks who would like at least a WinCVS appendix.

The Password to Larkspur Lane takes us back in time to an era when carrier pigeons and telegraphs still existed for communication, touring cars and roadsters could be seen on country lanes, doctors prescribed linament, women wore frocks and silk stockings, and men wore spats.<br /><br />  I love the way the story unfolds visually, almost like watching a movie.  In the beginning we see Nancy in the garden picking larkspurs for a flower show.  Later we picture her in her maroon roadster with the family's temporary maid, Effie, trying to follow the flight of a passenger pigeon and still later with her friend, Helen, searching for the mysterious Larkspur Lane.  We watch her with Ned at Sylvan Lake and at a dance at the yacht club.<br /><br />  For the adventurous, this book has plenty of heart-thumping danger for Nancy at the old sanitorium, where she must try to rescue an elderly woman being held against her will by an evil Dr. Bull and his associates.  With courage, tenacity and intelligence (and the help of her friend, Helen) Miss Drew risks her life for all of the women who have been conned by the con artists.  Her  determination to thwart these villanous, greedy people and bring them to justice makes this a truly satisfying book.", "images": [], "asin": "1557091641", "parent_asin": "1557091641", "user_id": "AGKBIXKD7ZXXMNIESU6A4642VCMA", "timestamp": 1264454101000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Some good observations", "text": "Every now and again, there is something that I read that takes me back to the awkward balancing act that was high school and how much stress it was. The older you get, the memories fade and then you read something and it brings it back. When it was precise, that was the feeling that I got while reading Lindsey Lee Johnson's &#34;The Most Dangerous Place on Earth&#34; in that sense that actions, both careless and thoughtful, can have big repercussions.<br /><br />The story takes place in a well-to-do town in California. It begins with eighth grade and we meet the students who who will make up the cast : Cally, Emma, Ryan, Abigail, Damon, Nick, Dave, Elizabeth and one more. It establishes their social world both in school and on social media. Social media being a point of connection and as a source of stress.<br /><br />Then it goes to high school and their junior year. The group is older and in varying degrees, separated and together. Their lives intersect and diverge as is the way of high school. There is a new teacher, Molly, who becomes interested in her students that functions as a catalyst to observe  and follow their stories over their junior and senior years.<br /><br />As noted, when the story is good, it hits that uncomfortable spot of remembering the social stress of adolescence. The writer also seems to know the terrain of where the story takes place as the details have an authentic vibe. For me, it was cruising to a 4 star until it just started to load up on every single possible pitfall that a young person could fall into. Suicide, car accident, bullying, cheating, pedophile teacher, and so on. It lays it on thick which pushes it into soap opera rather than keen observation.

But mindful meditation is such a different thing to me and I've found it so helpful. So I was really happy about this easy to follow book.<br />Each day has it's own short section, so it doesn't feel too overwhelming to tackle, but there are also some powerful questions to go over to help reflect on the new thing I tried that day.<br />For example, one part says to set a reminder to do mindful meditation 3 times a day and instantly I said \"no way!!\", but, I kept reading, and the way she broke the exercise down into these very short segments, it suddenly became something that was more manageable and very possible even on busy days.<br />It also makes you ask yourself the perfect questions for that particular exercise....some practice items I'd see and think \"well duh!\", but then, once I stopped and thought about it, I realized that I don't typically TRULY ask myself, or give myself permission to take the time for, some of these seemingly simple things, let alone take action to do anything positive about it. It seems easy but if you're really digging in, it's not that easy at first. But, say, on a subject that is a bit more difficult or intense for me personally (like all of chapter 2 and day 40 \ud83d\ude0a ), I've been able to go even slower and take it small step by small step to get through it and came out with some new ways to help me deal with some of these issues in a positive way and I really appreciate that more then I can put into words here!<br /><br />I'm told that in the printed copy of the book there are open blank spots by the reflection questions and other places, so you can have your notes right in the book which is awesome!

{"rating": 5, "title": "One Of The Best New 52 Relaunches", "text": "Reprints Aquaman (2011 ongoing series) #s 1-6.  To be honest, when I first started reading this book, I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but it won me over fairly quickly.  Aquaman Volume 1: The Trench introduces the post-Flashpoint Aquaman, and as with a number of other DC titles launched that first month of the New 52 era, an awful lot of previous Aquaman canon was severely altered or even eliminated.  So we're starting this corner of the DC Universe on a pretty fresh page.  The existence of Aquaman has been known to the public for six years--much shorter than in the pre-Flashpoint continuity--and he seems to have gone public as a superhero about five years ago.  (DC shrank the amount of time most of its central characters had been around, and also made nearly all of the lead characters look younger.)  So how is Aquaman at the beginning of this new era?  Well, it seems this charter member of the Justice League, lord of the seas, fierce fighter against evil, one of the more powerful super-beings on the planet is....an object of widespread public ridicule?<br /><br />It seems DC has decided to respond to the naysayers (who I always ignored) who derided the character--\"He's only there in case the Justice League needs to talk to a fish\" and so on--by incorporating that sentiment into the world the character lives in.  And if you've found the jokes at the Lord Of The Seven Seas's expense over the years irritating, you can only imagine how peeved Aquaman himself is about it.  Early on Aquaman arrives on the scene of what appears to be a bank heist and puts a quick end to it before lives are put at risk...but not before being laughed at by the criminals he's about to stop.  Then he's met with skepticism by the police he helped.  This public sentiment about Aquaman isn't universal, but it's quite widespread.  I didn't think this would work; it does though.  As readers we see Aquaman as he really is, a top tier superhuman champion with a volatile temper he only barely holds in check.  Many others see him differently.  Early on thete's an air to the book that sooner or later something's going to happen, or Arthur's going to let his temper slip, and MAKE everybody stop laughing at him.<br /><br />Even with having to put up with all of this, Aquaman's still got it pretty good.  He's taken a leave of the ocean and Atlantis to try and make a life for himself on the surface world he grew up in, and he's got Mera with him.  The press calls her Aquawoman; she appears to hate that name.<br /><br />Troubles with public perception are going to be the least of the pair's worries though.  Deep under the Atlantic Ocean, a long-sealed trench has opened up, and out come a horde of vicious semi-humanoid amphibious creatures (fantastic art on these) ravenous for food, including human meat.  They swarm into the coastal town of Beachrock, a community close to the lighthouse Arthur and Mera are now using as a home.  The battle takes place both on land and in and beneath the ocean, and the pair is left to make some very tough decisions very quickly.  This is a consistent theme with the New 52 books: the heroes can't always save everybody, and the right thing to do is not always clear.  What is clear is that this is a great launch into Aquaman's corner of the New 52 DC Universe.

Al Capone wants him out of the way, while Capone's rival Bobby Smiles wants Tintin on his side. There's car chases, train chases, and even a scene or two in the Old West.

{"rating": 4, "title": "A great suspenseful and paranormal read you won't be able to put down!", "text": "Dark Passage is a gripping story and I finished it in one day! The story felt magnetic and I could not stop reading it! It is told from several different point of views and that was confusing to me at first, because I didn't know we had changed to a different character's POV. For future books, I think putting the character's name at the top of the page would help clear up that confusion. I really appreciated the different views from each character though, it really helped to round out the story.<br /><br />Dark Passage is ultimately about good versus evil. A great battle is looming between the two sides. Which side will each character choose? This gripping story will have you uptight and maybe a bit anxious, until you finish the book! Will Jen be united with her soul mate and will good ultimately win over evil? The dark parts of this book were a bit dark for my taste. Reading about certain ritual sacrifices for the evil side were hard for me to stomach. However, they were not too descriptive, I am just more sensitive to violence than some people. That said, I was totally dumbfounded when the author dropped the \"f-bomb\" in the middle of the book. I felt it was completely out of place and not necessary to the story. For a book that discusses angels, God and the ultimate good, it seemed uncalled for. For those reasons I gave it four stars out of five. An overall great read, Dark Passage will not disappoint! I am anxious to see how things work out in the next book in the series!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Since posting my review the author has contacted me and informed me that the \"f-bomb\" has been taken out of both the Kindle version and the newest paperback version of the book!<br /><br />I received this book for free.", "images": [], "asin": "B007E22NY8", "parent_asin": "B007E22NY8", "user_id": "AFYF2YPXM54YD4RA7T2GGW2YXHYQ", "timestamp": 1335566265000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Another fascinating sojourn in the Punktown universe", "text": "Jeffrey Thomas' Blue War is a highly enjoyable novel that is hard to categorize as it blends a number of sub-genres into a thoroughly engaging whole. Being another of Thomas' Punktown stories, it has the urban-punk feel familiar to readers of China Mieville and William Gibson. And with the return of Jeremy Stake, the chameleon-like war veteran turned private investigator of his previous novel Deadstock, it has the gritty detective feel of Dashiell Hammet in a sci-fi setting. Add in a dose of a Michael Crichton cautionary techno-tale and you'll approach what there is to find in Blue War.<br /><br />Chronologically, Blue War takes place shortly after the events of Deadstock and while Blue War could work as a stand-alone novel, it really works better if you've read Deadstock first. One of the things about Thomas' world of Punktown that makes it stand above others is that it - and the characters who inhabit it - all have history, and Thomas does a wonderful job of bringing this out in his descriptions:<br /><br />\"The men and women sheltering in the gloom of the Legion of Veterans' Post 69 ranged in age from early thirties to there-are-still-people-alive-from-that-war? The bartender was a veteran of the Red War, which had cost him an arm, replaced with a black prosthesis like something grafted on from a giant beetle. Watt was a Choom, one of the indigenous people of this planet, Oasis, though most of the Earth people in the colony city dubbed Punktown had been born here, too, as had their parents and even grandparents. To all appearances Watt was human, aside from the wide mouth carved back to his ears, giving his broad face a bit of a frog-like aspect. He was, however, rather more dangerous-looking than a frog.<br />--Seated in the post were a couple of Punktown servicemen who had been deployed to the world of Echo, part of a raid on the colony city of Oracle. A group of Red Jihad extremists had captured and sabotaged the atmosphere control facilities there, resulting in the death of 37,000 colonists. One of these vets, named Isaiah, cried a lot when he'd had a few Knickersons too many, recounting the numbers of suffocated children he had seen throughout the colony, strewn everywhere like placid-faced dolls.<br />--There were the brothers, Bobby and Wally, slouched over the bar in shiny blue jackets and faded baseball hats, all covered in glittering pins and embroidered patches indicating that they'd been crewmen aboard two military starcraft in the same fleet. They were withered and cantankerous and intent on claiming their explosive space battles made every other vet's war look like a picnic in the park. Gnome-like Bobby frequently came close to blows with younger vets, infantrymen bristling at the suggestion that their ground combat could be less hellish than what this old-timer had experienced from inside his massive warship. They always restrained themselves, however, having heard that his brother Wally had once smashed the jaw of a drunken vet twenty years younger than himself, in this very bar. Not to mention that Watt was quick to break up trouble, and that plastic beetle claw could grip you by the back of the neck good and hard on your way out the door.<br />--Two black men with shaved skulls, a branded insignia on their foreheads and metallic silver bar code on the back of their necks, had been coming in to sit at one end of the bar for a few months now. No one knew what war or conflict they'd been in, and they didn't volunteer it. Maybe Watt knew, but he was discreet. They spoke to no one, not even each other, just sipped their Zubs and watched the big VT screen mounted on the walls. Their polished domes reflected the blue of a holographic sign that read: 'Zub... for a mellow buz!' \"<br /><br />In this novel, Stake, a veteran of a war known as the Blue War that took place on an alien world called Sinan, a war that ended eleven years ago, is called on by an old army buddy who wants him to go back to Sinan to help solve a mystery that is threatening to unravel the peace that has held there for eleven years.  A seemingly harmless Jin Haa urbanization project involving \"smart matter\" technology that allows a city to basically grow itself has gone wildly out of control, spilling across the border into Ha Jiin territory and swallowing up vast swathes of land. To make matters stranger still, the city has apparently created a living clone of a human, something it was not designed to do. Henderson needs Stake to try and find out what has gone wrong, and who this unknown clone child was made from, before war breaks out again. As as anyone who has read Deadstock will know, Stake himself has some unresolved history with his enemy/lover of his previous time on Sinan, the beautiful - and deadly - blue-skinned \"Earth Killer\", Thi Gonh.<br /><br />One of the things I particularly like about Thomas' characters is that they are not black or white. They have their flaws, their baggage, and in many cases their conflicts, both in themselves and with others. All of which make them all the more real, and what happens to them will matter to the reader.<br /><br />And as in Deadstock, there are a number of highly imaginative creations that are sprinkled throughout Blue War:  benders (imagine Portugese Man-o-War's that can float through the air and kill you in ways you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy), snipes (no, these aren't imaginary though you'll wish they were if you run into them), rust art, Wonky Science, smart matter, and others.<br /><br />All in all, Blue War works on a number of levels; quite an achievement for such an ambitious blending of genres. And, without giving anything away, one can only hope that there will be more, of Stake, of Thi, and of Punktown in general.  Highly recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "1844165329", "parent_asin": "1844165329", "user_id": "AHYEPWP7J2KSK4HRCA7HWM42ZFBA", "timestamp": 1269837513000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Very Dark Comic Thriller That Occasionally Veers into Grand Guignol", "text": "\"Dr. Fischer of Geneva,\"(1980), was, I believe the 25th novel published by widely-known and respected British author Graham Greene in his very long career that spanned most of the 20th century.  It is one of his last published novels, and is a 150 page, novella length, very dark comic thriller.<br /><br />It is narrated by Alfred Jones, child of a knight in the British Foreign Service, who has fallen very far socially and economically from the class into which he was born.  He does, however, have that proficiency in languages so useful to the Foreign Service, and lives and works in Switzerland, as a translator at a firm that produces that characteristic Swiss product, chocolate.  Jones, who lost both his left hand and his parents in the same night's World War II German bombardment of London, has married Anna-Luise, Fischer's beautiful heiress daughter, who is, furthermore, much his junior.  He comes to discover he hates his father-in-law, a powerful multi-millionaire who made his fortune by inventing Dentophil Bouquet, a supposedly more effective toothpaste.  Although, to be sure, the author Greene, who never lost his eye for the telling detail, has Anna-Luise tell Jones that her father doesn't use his own product: he instead uses, she says, \"Something called a Water-Pik.\"Go know that Water-Piks were even available thirty years ago.<br /><br />At any rate, Dr. Fischer is known for his dinner parties, at which he debases and humiliates other rich people, his so-called \"friends,\" whom his daughter calls \"toads.\" His guests apparently are so greedy for the lavish gifts which their host--for whom they do not really care-- will ultimately present them that they will swallow any treatment he dishes out, up to and including possible death.<br /><br />Like most of Greene's prodigious output, this novel was filmed, as an all-star television production. It was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, starred James Mason as Dr. Fischer, Alan Bates as Alfred Jones, Greta Scacchi as Anna-Luise, and Cyril Cusack as Steiner, a companion music lover of Anna-Luise's late mother.<br /><br />Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career, during which he gave us THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and OUR MAN IN HAVANA, among many others. Many, if not most, of his works were made into notable films.<br /><br />The author's books were very well-written, highly literate; much praised by the critics, and enjoyed a wide readership; they were frequently best sellers. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. Greene, who also worked as a screenwriter, always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals. However, if you've never read him before, I wouldn't necessarily recommend starting here. It's black-on-black, occasionally veering into Grand Guignol, to which I must admit I didn't know quite how to respond.  It's also hard to find. Might as well start with something more entertaining, like THE COMEDIANS, or TRAVELS WITH MY AUNT.", "images": [], "asin": "0140185283", "parent_asin": "0140185283", "user_id": "AHWH4MZ2KD5RASDETTSVDK3CYTGA", "timestamp": 1313763758000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Another Pointless Self-Help Book", "text": "I'm not sure why I ordered this book other than that it was free. I am not the type of person who reads self-help or business books and the one or two times in my life that I was forced to do so I couldn't see the point of the book nor did I derive anything beneficial. I have been in sales most of my life and at various points have been known as one of the top salesmen in my field. I've often been asked to share what has made me successful so I have taught classes on selling. It seems to me to be an exercise in futility. I wish it was easy to simply tell some one how to be or what to do and that success will follow. It is my belief that human beings are infinitely more complex than what the business & self-help books portray and they do not change easily, if ever. I am sure that there are people who have benefitted from this class of book but I have never met one and I suspect they are rare. People are what they are and even if you get them excited for a short time they soon revert to their norm.<br /><br />As far as this book goes it seems neither better nor worse than other books in its class. It relies on telling stories to show people how they might use different behaviours to achieve more influence. I don't think reading this book is going to enable anyone to make a profound change in their lives, just as the past twenty years worth of self-help and business books haven't seemed to make a bit of difference to anyone I know personally or within society in general. There is an old saying, \"Those who can, do, those who can't, teach\". That's why I don't teach anymore. It's depressing to try and teach something and see that the message sent just isn't ever received because of the fundamental difference in experience, motivation, outlook and thought processes between two different people. I would also offer this thought....the only way you'll change your life or influence others successfully is simply to go try doing it and get better. In other words, there is no magic words/spell/book that is going to change your world. There is only doing, practice, and gaining experience. Save your time and money, skip the book, and go practice influencing others. You'll fail a lot, but then you get better incrementally, and you'll have made progress. It's as unlikely that you'll make progress reading a book as it is unlikely that you'll learn to play the piano by reading a book. People make a lot of money by the lure of a shortcut to be found within the pages of their book but I don't know of any shortcuts to playing a piano or in learning to influence others.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Here's An Idea for the Next Boring Dinner Party you May Attend...", "text": "Well, this is a most peculiar book, very surprising and ingenious, quite different from anything you are likely to have read in the recent past or in the near future for that matter. Even the title leaves you thinking something is a bit odd...<br /><br />The very meandering plot revolves around Miles Garth, an ethical consultant, somewhere in his forties, who, one night at a dinner party in Greenwich, gets up between courses, makes his way upstairs to the spare room and locks himself in. Indefinitely. You would probably get up and isolate yourself too if you were at a dinner party with guests such as were at this dinner party. Nevertheless we never find out why he takes this course of action, in fact the reason, whatever it may be, has no bearing at all on how the story unfolds. Almost overnight Miles becomes a cause celebre, with people camping out in the street to catch a glimpse of him, organising a food delivery by basket and rope (he is vegetarian and the owner of the house he refuses to leave only feeds him slim slices of ham slid under the door), and media swarming as media does.<br /><br />Four people, closely and loosely associated with Miles narrate the four chapters - There, But, For, The. Anna met Miles on a bus tour of Europe some 20 years prior; Mark is Miles' boyfriend and had taken Miles with him to the dinner party; May is an elderly lady biding time and hating it in a rest home; and Brooke is a nine year old girl, highly intelligent, lively, bordering on precocious and loving it. There are other people too on the periphery such as the other dinner party guests, Mark's long time boyfriend, May's husband and Brooke's parents as well as Jen, the dinner party hostess.<br /><br />The message or theme of this book? Not entirely sure, but feel it has something to do with No Man Is An Island, or maybe he is, and one state or the other is neither a bad thing or a good thing. Confused?<br /><br />So we play a bit loose with the point of the book but the real pleasure of this book, what stopped me from putting it down and thinking all a bit too odd really, is the writing. It is an absolute joy to read because Ms Smith is a master of words - puns galore (Brooke LOVES puns); witty clever dialogue used in such a way that the character of the speaker is revealed without us really knowing anything about them - the dinner party is fantastic reading (I read it twice); enlightening discussions about the word 'But' for example. Brooke is truly delightful, she would be an impossible child to have in a classroom, but her observations of the adults around her, her passionate interest in her home town of Greenwich as the place that Western time is measured from, (read symbolism for the time passing in the lives of the characters) marks her out as quite the most interesting character in the book.<br /><br />The whole thing is really quite genius, I just loved her use of language, it dances all over and it all contributed to the package of what is quite an unusual book, but all in a good way.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Reads like a Korean \"Lonesome Dove\"", "text": "I am always ready to lose myself in historical fiction but I never thought that a book that takes place so recently would fascinate me. We know of Korea as a divided country that is so poor in the North that people scrounge in public parks for flowering buds or even pigeons to eat because of the constant prospect of starvation. By contrast, in the South we have corporations like Samsung and KIA who sell their products in the United States. Many of us have family in the military who have spent time in South Korea. The Korea in \"Tendrils of Life\" is a post World War 2 country reeling from years of Japanese rule and then the occupation of United Nations troops with the United States calling the shots because they defeated Japan.  A family is brought back to the mainland of South Korea after an idyllic life on an isolated island. The father seems to be a passionate follower of causes that will bring justice to the land. Of course he earns the emnity of some friends he grew up with as well as relatives. His family suffers, living hand to mouth in Seoul while the father is gone. The son,Jimin, takes menial jobs before school to help feed his mother and sister. He begins to have a lifelong resentment of his father but because the father is in jail or in hiding much of the time, he cannot express it to him. The war comes to not only the cities but the countryside and the family finds themselves being torn apart and reunited with each other and former friends. Jimin wishes so much to return to the island of his youth but he wants his family with him  and it seems that there is always a band of soldiers, bandits or physical barriers keeping him from his family. This is a roller coaster and I had to stay with it because I was so invested in the characters that I finished it very quickly.

{"rating": 4, "title": "A Historical Crime Drama", "text": "This is my first Colson Whitehead novel. I have a number of his books on my TBR but I always tend to put off reading books that are what I put in the category of \"heavier novels\". However, this one was a great balance.<br /><br />This book chronicles the life of a business owning black man in 60's era Harlem. Ray Carney comes from a crooked family. Raised by his father who was a known crook. As an adult, Ray went to college and got his business degree and now owns a furniture store. He's legit and provides for his wife and 2 children. Even he if does meddle in products that were acquired by less than honest means. He's only \"a little crooked\". There is also a heist of a prominent Harlem hotel that Carney is pulled into by his cousin Freddy, that doesn't go all that smoothly.<br /><br />I loved Whitehead's writing. There were points in the book that fell flat and made me a little bored but they were easy to get through due to the beautiful writing. This book chronicles what is was like in 60's Harlem as a black man, an entrepreneur, and as a crook. The characters are all interesting and there's even some humor that if you don't pay attention, you could miss. I am very excited to read his other books now that I've dipped my toes.

But to my surprise, this book goes a lot deeper.  I was positive you had to be an electrical engineer in order to understand the dynamics of the book.  After some closer reading, I have determined that it is not all that difficult to understand.<br /><br />And, I am sure with a deeper and closer approach to the content of the book, one can come away with some selective knowledge.<br /><br />Chapter Setup is easy to navigate throughout; each chapter with a bullet list identifies what you are to expect, plus there is an easy to understand introduction to each chapter.<br /><br />List of Figures.  It is not often that a book has a listing and page number of each of the Figures in the book.  The book contains about 150 Figures, and the reader can locate specific ones easily.  Also, each Figure demonstration is easy to read, clearly identified, and very well labeled.<br /><br />Projects.  One good thing about the information is that the author gives the reader something to do, something to try on his own.  The Projects sections are easily identified.<br /><br />Page Layout.  This is not a high book, but it is in black and white, plenty of whitespace surrounds the pages, Topics are clearly identified in Bold Font.  Diagrams, charts, demos, whatever are well spaced, nothing is crowded and easy to read the print.<br /><br />Again, do not get this book if you can't figure how your IPAD or IPOD work.  But what you will learn is the concept of electronics, principles that formt he basis of electronics.  Here is an idea of some of the topics you will learn about;  Electronics - atoms, charge, conductors, magnetism, voltage sources, systems, linear circuits, binary, how microcomputers work, wireless, satellites, audio electronics, digital, video tech, cable, etc., etc.<br /><br />Again, the average person, like me, will not understand the majority of this book, but you will always get something out of it.  Those who understand the tech of electronics, especially, in this electronic age, will understand much more than me.  Excellent book, great reference!

{"rating": 4, "title": "Good reading even for a youngish adult", "text": "Sequel to Melissa Marr's Wicked Lovely Fragile Eternity reacquaints us with Seth, Ash and Keenar as they struggle with the consequences of the previous novel's conclusion. Ash plays the reluctant immortal, Seth deals with the devil to be with Ash, and Keenar continues with his romantic pursuit of Ash.<br /><br />Risking a cheesy Twilight rip-off, Fragile Eternity does quite well (as predicted in my review of Ink Exchange I might add.) The characters seem genuine and 3-d and the plot flows without becoming mired in drippy romantic dialogue.<br /><br />There are a couple of flaws. First is an issue I have with many urban fantasy novels, which is that they play too much as a series, as in far too much page time is given to build up for cataclysmic future events, can either lead to tension being defused somewhat over the story, and/or disappointment in the end when some issues are left unresolved.<br /><br />Second is Marr's supernatural imagery. What is quite a cool idea- The faerie folk having elemental effects on the environment around then, and War in particular having strange-bird like features- is somewhat diminished by the clipped and plain prose used to describe them. I imagine it would all look awesome on the big screen, but in a novel reader's need a little more descriptive writing, perhaps and appeal to senses other than sight (for example if ice is forming on the walls, shouldn't the characters feel cold?)<br /><br />A prior flaw that is less evident in this novel is the overuse of Faerie politics and practice carrying the plot. Most of what goes on in Fragile eternity is easy to follow, and interesting. Marr's series is definitely worth a read, as going by my theories each following book will be better than the last, by the forth we could have a sure best-seller.", "images": [], "asin": "006121471X", "parent_asin": "006121471X", "user_id": "AFCZERNJOXNOVCXZ4NZKIAITHEAQ", "timestamp": 1268626716000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 4, "title": "Hardboiled pastoral", "text": "Published shortly before the author's suicide in 1950, after an affair with an American actress, the hardboiled nature of Cesare Pavese's final novel demonstrates his skill, honed by translations of American literature, in integrating the hardboiled prose style or Chandler, Cain, and Hemingway back into Italian. Or vice versa, as R.W. Flint's rendering in turn of Pavese emphasizes its affinities. I am reminded of how Hemingway tried to convey Spanish idioms or Italian landscapes in his own fiction, so Pavese's familiar tone, for American readers in this 2002 edition for New York Review Classics, should find a ready reception among those curious to see how an Italian enamored of American sensibilities tries to work them into his own language, and his own post-war, pastoral sensibilities.<br /><br />The results, to me, are modest but successful on these terms. Mark Rudman's introduction might be read as an afterward, for he gives away the whole plot and its climactic scene. However, Pavese's decision to treat that as the final two pages of his novel, and to cut away from any lasting denouement, attests to his skill, and daring.<br /><br />Other writers would have softened this or pressed it into a framework more pliable. It's true that for long stretches of this 150-page novel, not much happens, on the other hand, so the action that does occur, told in retrospect, does matter more. I was not as pulled into the narrative as I expected. Perhaps as a Californian, viewing the remove at which Oakland, Fresno, the great valleys, and the desert of this state are evoked in a stylized manner (reminding me of the rather endearing way Kafka imagined his Amerika) kept me distanced. I was not convinced by the narrator's loves or adventures, for these--nodding back to the tough-guy inspirations--are not given enough depth to draw you close.<br /><br />However, in the smells of Italy's lime trees, the legend of how the moon fructifies the fields if bonfires are set at its margins, and how as in 1914, so since: war is &#34;a lot of dogs unchained by their masters to murder each other and keep their masters in control&#34; (88), there is enough to satisfy a reader. &#34;Maybe it is better that way, better for everything to go up in a bonfire of dry grass and for people to begin again. That was how it was in America--when you were sick of something, a job or a place, you changed it. Over there even whole towns, with taverns, city halls and stores, are as empty now as graveyards.&#34; (120-1) This sparely told narrative leaves its impression, in a muted, melancholic manner. Not the lively evocation of the war against the Fascists I had suspected, Pavese prefers to tamp down the emotion, and to use memory and equivocation to explore his national pain.", "images": [], "asin": "1590170210", "parent_asin": "1590170210", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1411852695000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Teenage Sydney Bristow from Alias meets X-Men`s Mystique w/ a couple significant weaknesses", "text": "IMPOSTOR, the first book in Suzanne Winnacker's Variant series, is kind of like a teenage Sydney Bristow from Alias meets X-Men`s Mystique. Tessa has been recruited to the FEA (Forces with Extraordinary Abilities) branch of the FBI. She's been training for two years and honing her chameleon-like ability to take on the appearance of anyone she touches. At sixteen she gets her first mission tracking a serial killer.<br /><br />The premise is really strong and the investigation takes a number of cool turns, not the least of which is the whole Variant concept which includes all kinds of abilities from invisibility to mind reading. The Variant idea isn't groundbreaking, nor is Veronica Mars-esque teen investigator, but what made IMPOSTOR work was the mystery/thriller plot which, apart from an uneven start, kept me guessing and engaged until the very end.<br /><br />While the story and concept were solid, there were a couple significant weaknesses. The writing isn't quite as good as I was hoping. It's very melodramatic, and the pacing was rushed. And Tessa as a character was really immature for someone in her situation. She was thoughtless and childish and realistically would never have been given as much control in a HUGE investigation based on her behavior. Which brings me to my second gripe with this book: the romance. It never came close to working for me. Alec, Tessa's slightly older trainer, is her longtime crush. He's got a girlfriend (who is a catty, vicious, witch-but a great guy like Alec is still into her), but he still has cuddling movie dates with Tessa and tons of almost-kissing moments. It made no sense that he would be interested in a girl as immature as Tessa despite their shared love of horror films.<br /><br />Despite the flaws, the strength of the story carried me easily to the very last page of IMPOSTOR. Hopefully, Tessa will grow by the next book in the Variant series since I'd kinda like to see where her story goes.<br /><br />Sexual content:<br />Kissing.

I don't know if, like Paul, I will face another round that will ultimately be the reason for my death.<br /><br />I do know, that like Paul, a consequence of having faced a cancer diagnosis is, even for someone like me who is not an ambitious doctor with much lower stress commitments, something that has caused me in a teeth-grindingly obvious cliche to want my energy spent in pursuit of the contentment one finds through family and friends and rejection of the urges society dictates in favor of things that create connection.<br /><br />Paul writes to his daughter Cady not to discount the joy she brought him, dying, as she lay on his lap: a little piece of the ever present now a parent can not deny or put off or fake.<br /><br />And while my own children were not of lap age during my diagnosis, and I am facing the loss of my own identity as their parent as they enter the high school years just before leaving home, I do believe that the best of all possible results of living through cancer treatment and the resulting lifetime of uncertainty is to live contentedly.\u00a0<br /><br />So if reading this book (along with Atul Gawande's Being Mortal) makes me a bit maudlin and cliche..so be it.

We never got close to any one character--and really never cared about any of them either. And the reasoning for the whole thing was really never quite made clear--at least not in a way that made sense for the characters to do what they did. I think this writer has potential--maybe a few more rewrites could have honed this into a really good horror story--it just wasn't quite there yet.", "images": [], "asin": "0804178119", "parent_asin": "0804178119", "user_id": "AENC5KEJIEYK7GROM6QDNE5SDS4A", "timestamp": 1429133225000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

The final third of the original text was Krantz looking at evidence of other unknown bipedal animals from around the world and examining those researching Sasquatch.

{"rating": 4, "title": "A Haitian Ithaca", "text": "This is labeled a novel, but that is stretching things. By his own admission, Haitian-Canadian author Dany Laferri&egrave;re writes only about himself; this book is essentially a memoir of his return to Haiti after spending 33 years as an exile in Montreal. A memoir, moreover, written largely in verse, though short passages of prose increasingly break up that texture. Although written as sixty separately-titled poems -- chapters, trains-of-thought, call them what you will -- there is a narrative line of sorts. Awakened in the middle of the night by news of his father's death in New York, the writer tidies his affairs in ice-bound Montreal, takes the train south to attend his father's memorial service, then flies to the heat and color of Haiti to break the news to his mother. She has remained in Port-au-Prince all these years after her husband's exile by Papa Doc Duvalier half a century before, only to see her son similarly forced into exile by the dictator's son, Baby Doc. And now his return.<br /><br />I read this 2009 winner of the prestigious Prix M&eacute;dicis in French, before it was translated into English, and have not seen this translation; any quotations here are my own, and possibly inferior. It would have posed an interesting task, though not because the language is especially difficult. On the contrary, Laferri&egrave;re writes in simple slightly idiomatic French, with an admirable directness of expression. But the very simplicity of the language, poetry that reads almost as prose (or vice-versa), leaves the translator no obvious stylistic or structural guidelines to mark the difference between flat fidelity and the author's finely-tuned evocation of the sights, scents, sounds, and people of his native land. There are charming moments, certainly: a cemetery painted in bright colors and primitive style by people for whom \"death seems as simple as saying good morning\"; or \". . . the lazy walk of a cow out for its evening stroll, the night becoming a Chagall.\" But horrors also: street people roasting a cat on a spit while its owner calls \"Mitzi\" in the distance; a woman whose son dies at the side of the highway because cars won't stop for fear she may be a bait for robbers. The book is full of comments about things that change, things that stay the same, and that terrible Haitian history, turning it into a land to which one can truly belong only in exile. All seen through the eyes of this middle-aged Odysseus returning to an overcrowded Ithaca where poverty and beauty go hand in hand.<br /><br />I have to say that there were sections in the middle of the book where I could not discern much direction. Laferri&egrave;re meets up with person after person whose main interest in meeting him seems to be \"to confirm that they are not dead.\" The prose thickens and pushes out the verse. But then at the very end, the opposite happens. Laferri&egrave;re goes to Barad&egrave;res, the little village on the coast where his father was born. The prose ends. The verse becomes more poetic, at one point even evoking Rimbaud. In the shade of a banana tree, time is suspended. Finally, a true arrival . . . but one that feels like a kind of farewell.", "images": [], "asin": "0857050486", "parent_asin": "0857050486", "user_id": "AGCWDKIATRJJB7QSRKWICHCKWQHQ", "timestamp": 1378434290000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Fun tales south of the border", "text": "This is a collection of stories written by Mike Mignola about the five months that Hellboy spent in Mexico back in 1956.<br /><br />Hellboy in Mexico--Hellboy and Abe Sapien are stuck in the Mexican desert in 1982. They seek shelter in an abandoned gas station where Abe discovers a picture of Hellboy with some luchedores (Mexican wrestlers). Hellboy tells a story from his 1956 sojourn in Mexico. He went with two other B.P.R.D. agents to investigate some mass killings. Things were horrible and the other two left. Hellboy joined up with a band of luchedores who were already fighting vampires and other monsters. He doesn't know any Spanish but they manage to fight all day and drink all night, until the demons get the better of them. A bittersweet ending was in store, triggering a five-month stay in Mexico that is aptly described as &quot;a drunken blur.&quot; The story is a great blend of horror and humor. The art by Richard Corben is distinct from Mignola's style but works very well for the story.<br /><br />Hellboy versus the Aztec Mummy--Hellboy catches up to a bat-demon and has a big fight with it and a bunch of zombies. There isn't much story here, just plenty of atmospheric fun. The exposition dump at the end is probably unnecessary other than filling out the bottom of the last page.<br /><br />Hellboy Gets Married--The drunken blur continues as Hellboy follows a mariachi band with a cute senorita in tow. He winds up marrying her though it turns out his beer goggles are exceptionally thick. Big fight ensues. The tale is a bit formulaic for Hellboy but Mignola includes lyrics from a few melancholic Mexican ballads to help set the tone. The weird talking wedding ring/snake is pretty cool too.<br /><br />The Coffin Man--A small girl bursts into a bar asking help for her uncle. The locals say they buried him yesterday, so what's the deal? She's worried about the Coffin Man, a grave-robbing zombie witch. Hellboy, being a stand-up guy, stands up and head out to help the girl watch over her uncle's grave. This story showcases the weird, made up mythology that Mignola is so good at crafting.<br /><br />House of the Living Dead--Hellboy has joined the luchedor circuit (mostly for drinking money) when he is called out by a mysterious doctor to fight the doctor's latest creation. That creation turns out to be Frankenstein's monster. The other classic Universal monsters (Dracula and the Wolf Man) show up, making a nice homage to the 1930's films. The story is both fun and melancholic, the classical Mignola blend. The art by Richard Corben follows the Hellboy in Mexico style and makes a nice conclusion to this book.<br /><br />The book also contains one-page introductions by Mignola discussing the origins of the stories and weird details (who knew that Mexican vampires can turn into turkeys?). The back has various sketches by the artists working on the stories. They are almost all drafts of final art, which I find only mildly interesting.

So, it did take me a bit of an adjustment to start this book, but I realize too that I'm not necessary the intended audience for this book. And that's okay. Because the themes and message of Moxie are relatable to girls and women of any age, I think, and it also carries about it the innocence and awkwardness of just growing up, and dealing with school, family, friends, and first loves.<br /><br />Viviane and her group of friends are juniors in the small town of East Rockport. Life is the same, year after year. High school football is the town's religion, and the football players and popular kids rule the school. This year is different though. There are two new transfer students, Lucy from Houston and Seth from Austin. Lucy is a vibrant, activist-type girl from the city who doesn't really understand the small town ways of East Rockport. And Seth is...Seth? I'm not really sure what to make of Seth. He's apparently cute, and not like the other guys. So, he's the love interest, but also kind of one-dimensional as a character. I loved Viviane though, her best friend Claudia, Lucy, and some other girls who take up the Moxie fight in the book.<br /><br />The &#34;moxie&#34; term starts when Viviane is inspired by her mother's rebel teenage years and enraged by the awfulness of what she and the other girls have to put up with in school. The boys are sexist and everything described in this book escalates and everything they do is totally disgusting and gross. The top guy behind the sexist shirts, the sexual harassment, and the like is the star player on the school's football team, and is also the son of the high school principal. Viviane is inspired from the '90s and decides to create &#34;zines&#34; (which I guess are little pamphlets or mini booklets?) and anonymously places them around the school to spur girls into action against the injustice of the patriarchy at their school.<br /><br />I liked Viviane and can see her passion for sticking up for what she believes in, despite her own insecurities about whether or not she'll get in trouble with the school. I love that this book doesn't pit girls against girls, but shows how lovely a book can be when all the girls get together and stand up for one another.<br /><br />There is a bit of a love story as far as teenage romances go. It's cute, I guess? I like that Viviane fights back and challenges Seth when he tries to make &#34;not all men...&#34; comments when Viviane complains about the boys at their high school. But I like that Seth is trying to learn and do better at the end, so there's that.<br /><br />Some issues I did have with the book is that while it does try to incorporate diversity and inclusion, it's still very much told from a white, cis het POV. There's maybe four (by my count) POC mentioned in the book who Viviane talks and interacts with. The book does go into race a little bit, but not much.<br /><br />Also, I'm not entirely sure how I feel that the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters were included only when Viviane stumbles upon two girls together (who are still closeted). With this scene, it was also mentioned that there's two guys in their senior year in the theatre department who are probably gay, but it's not clear, just rumors. The entire scene feels like a last-minute addition, and it would have been better to have been more upfront with including LGBTQ+ characters rather than an off-handed mention that spanned all of three pages in the book. Again, this story is set in a small Texas town, but I think it would have been nice for more inclusion instead of just being a side note.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a strong feminist novel and I loved seeing girls helping girls and seeing them empowering each other throughout the novel. The ending is on a good note, and a powerful YA contemporary that I would recommend to teens and young adults.<br /><br />***I received an ARC from PenguinTeen in a giveaway***", "images": [], "asin": "1626726353", "parent_asin": "1626726353", "user_id": "AFGD46BWRQP2UBU34MNNHDY6LIAQ", "timestamp": 1505869812017, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 4, "title": "Recommended", "text": "Taking Root in Provence is a collection of short vignettes about the author's experiences settling in Provence and getting to know her new neighborhood and culture. Author Anne-Marie Simons retired with her husband, Oscar, and spent some time travelling before settling down in the town Aix-en-Provence, France. Simons writes about the weather, shopping, holidays, art, language, food, wine, and more. As I read through the short three to four page chapters, it occurred to me that they read like a series of blog posts, which indeed, they were originally.<br /><br />Taking Root in Provence contains many pleasant, short essays about all aspects of life in the author's new environs.

{"rating": 5, "title": "This book rocks!  Unfortunately, they're molten!", "text": "This is the complete review as it appears &lt;a href=\"http://ianwoodnovellum.blogspot.com/2014/11/harry-and-hot-lava-by-chris-robertson.html\">at my blog dedicated to reading, writing (no 'rithmatic!), movies, & TV&lt;/a>.  Blog reviews often contain links which are not reproduced here, nor will updates or modifications to the blog review be replicated here.  Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.<br /><br />Note that I don't really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't.  I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading!  The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited.  So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).<br /><br />I rated this book WORTHY!<br /><br />This is a very short children's picture book, so there isn\u2019t a lot to review. It\u2019s about a kid with a delightfully wild imagination (he reminds me of my own kids whose imaginations, thankfully, have never deserted them even though they're now way too old for a book like this), who appears to be stranded amidst hot lava which is invading his home from all quarters. Can he leap to freedom? Where will he land? (You might be surprised!)<br /><br />The drawings are rudimentary but very colorful, and really evocative. The book is as full of excitement and danger as Harry is full of ideas and wild descriptions, but he never panics, and is always planning his escape. This is definitely something your kids will want to play - perhaps after exploring what real lava looks like - not in person of course - but from the safety of a TV documentary or something on the web.<br /><br />Who knows, perhaps you have a budding vulcanologist in your family? I recommend this book for a fun read alone, but it\u2019s also a great starting point for a chance to stir your child's imagination about the wonders of planet Earth and it's geology and inner structure.<br /><br />Of course, you don't want to load them up with learning, learning, learning and nothing else, so it occurs to me that a whole day could be themed around this as they're encouraged to explore the idea, starting with the book, then a video, then perhaps go looking for rocks in the yard or at the park (assuming your park isn't buried under snow at this point!), and imagine how hot things would have to be to melt an actual rock! You can have them practice their motor skills emulating Harry's escapes (with due safety precautions, of course!), have them develop confidence and cool-thinking skills, and also have them appreciate a little more the wonderful and complex planet on which we're all privileged to live.", "images": [], "asin": "B00IOSM3AA", "parent_asin": "B00IOSM3AA", "user_id": "AH7TZVYXUXXANBMPMALAYJPGMJMA", "timestamp": 1416695535000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Delightful Short Novel With Likeable Characters", "text": "This is a delightful little book, reminding me of the book Invisible Ellen. It's one of those books where you don't need much character development to develop empathy and appreciation for the characters.  Arthur meets Maddy when he's visiting his dead wife in the cemetery; he eats a lunch sandwich there every day. Maddy is a high school senior who's got a hopeless crush on a jerk. Lucille, Arthur's neighbor, is in love with a guy she plans to marry; she calls herself his fiance, much to the frustration of the man's blood relatives.<br /><br />Warm-hearted Arthur reaches out to Maddy in a totally open way. Maddy's parents seem uninvolved at best. When Maddy's dad meets Arthur, he's mainly concerned about whether Maddy has enough money.<br /><br />Arthur and Lucille are portrayed lovingly, if somewhat stereotypically, as elderly people moving in different directions. Arthur's a life coach to everybody, always positive and solution-oriented. Lucille is a champion baker with a needy personality.<br /><br />It's not going to be a series book, so it doesn't leave me wanting more (the way Invisible Ellen and Becoming Ellen did). It's complete and satisfying on its own...more filling than a salad, yet not meaty enough to be a steak.", "images": [], "asin": "1400069904", "parent_asin": "1400069904", "user_id": "AFUYB7S5KW5KKBNJA2H6D2G6OBEA", "timestamp": 1491705333000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 5, "title": "A masterpiece that should be widely read", "text": "Relatively few people are alive today who experienced any aspect of WWII as a teenager or older. Fewer still live in countries where the WWII experience can be freely discussed, as in the United States and UK. The Soviet Union considered the war to be a people's war and only recently have stories of individual experiences been forthcoming. In Germany, less and less attention is paid to the horrendous crimes of the German people. France dramatizes its miniscule, if even existent, role. And in Japan, as Hastings points, out widespread denial is still the norm. As a result, accurate knowledge of WWII and its horrors and few glories is rapidly fading from human consciousness - and with that forgetfulness comes the danager of new and even more horrible wars.<br /><br />  Max Hastings writes highly readable military histories. He eschews footnotes and the minutia of academic writing in favor of a friendly narrative style. There is considerable depth, however. In its 550 pages, Hastings covers a war that spanned the years 1931 - 1945 and a bit beyond. It covered a larger geographic area than any other conflict in history, though most of the area was the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />  The book opens on the saddest possible note: the dedication is to Max Hasting's son who apparently died at age 27 in 2000. And on that sad note, the deaths of millions and unspeakable cruelties at the hands of the Japanese are chronicled in the following pages.<br /><br />  In twenty-two chapters, Hastings treats every major aspect of the war against the Japanese by the primary combatants: the United States, Britain, China and late in the game, the Soviet Union.<br /><br />  Hastings begins with a look at the motivation and goals of the United States. President Roosevelt had announced the goal was unconditional surrender. In recent years, revisionist historians have claimed that this policy prolonged the war. Throughout the book, Hastings demolishes these arguments over and over again. It is quite something to see: Hastings has a clear mastery of the subject.<br /><br />  He then goes on to describe the various battlefronts and he is equally at home here. He uses dozens, if not hundreds, of interviews and memoirs to create his descriptions of battles like the British Burma campaign, the Battle of Leyte Gulf and so on, all the time weaving in the machinations of the main players in the Japanese, US, British and other governments. It is a very effective approach. His descriptions of the battles on Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the sea war at the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the kamikazee campaign leave no room for doubt as to why the Americans feared the blood cost of an invasion of Japan.<br /><br />  This is a critical history and Hastings heaps it on. The vastly overrated Douglas MacArthur is cut appropriately down to size, though Hastings does laud his post-war stewardship of Japan. Hastings criticizes the revisionists, apologists and anti-Americans who condemn the United States for its actions, such as the use of nuclear weapons. He spares nothing in his criticism and outright condemnation of Japanese leaders, past and present for the widespread atrocities.<br /><br />  I devour history and there are few well-written histories, so I found myself dealing with \"Retribution\" as if it were a great thriller and couldn't wait to get from one page to another. I truly wish that books like this were require reading in America's schools so chilren would grow up with an understanding of why they enjoy such lavish freedom. It did not come free and Hastings gives new life to the tens of thousands of Americans who died in the Pacific and Asian campaigns. It is a sobering book and one that I hope will be widely read.<br /><br />Jerry", "images": [], "asin": "0307263517", "parent_asin": "0307263517", "user_id": "AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA", "timestamp": 1209754992000, "helpful_vote": 36, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "innovate or disappear", "text": "There have been many books in the past few years lamenting the slowing of economic growth. Some pin the blame on specific triggers such as the financial crisis of 2008. In this book, the authors explain why the giant leaps in technology has not resulted in corresponding economic upturns. They contrast this to the rapid growths in the past after major industrial revolutions. They blame four factors, namely, gray capital, corporate managerialism, globalization, and complex regulation.<br /><br />Each of these factors are fascinating. Gray ownership, they say, is capitalism without capitalists. The main problem today is that corporations have grown so huge that no one knows who owns what. Traditional capitalists own the company and they provide the drive that propels their companies forward. Today, shareholders leave the companies to be driven by paid executives. And the shareholding in companies are also layered in that the shareholders are often hedge-funds. The rise of such corporations is due in large part, the authors say, to globalization. They also claim that the rise of bureaucracy and red tape in these corporations slow down growth. 'Managerialism has become the meta-ideology of the business world'. It has led to the downfall of the mighty Nokia and Motorola. Size was no longer capable of balancing transaction costs.<br /><br />The authors further claim that the inclination towards a high degree of specialization in the globalised world ironically slows down innovation. At the same time, increasing regulations especially after the financial crisis of 2008 has an adverse impact on innovation. In country after country innovative schemes such as Uber are attacked, and consequently, many such businesses join politics to fight the regulators. Politics and regulations sometimes find themselves behind technological advances. The drones of Amazon and the electric cars of Tesla are examples of the tussle between regulators and technology.<br /><br />Ignorance is the father of fear, so the faster technology advances, the greater the fear and scepticism of the masses. The authors say that the World Wide Web is now more like the Wicked Witch of the West. Thus the authors suggest that to 'spark new life into capitalism, attention must be given to, first, severing the link between gray capital and corporate ownership,; second, giving competition a real boost; and third, nurturing a culture of dissent and eccentricity'.", "images": [], "asin": "0300217404", "parent_asin": "0300217404", "user_id": "AG2DS6RVU3U4YZTESLLKGDZO75SA", "timestamp": 1486438576000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 5, "title": "Missing girls & an FBI agent who will not stop looking", "text": "Riley Lambert strives to be perfect. She graduated from college early and became a FBI Special Agent She was the best in her field of expertise; a profiler that found the lost and saved them. She didn't feel like celebrating when she closed a case. All she ever though of was the one case she may never close. She has nightmares about the last time she saw her sister; when that man took her away and a curtain of guilt fell over her life. Survivor's guilt plagues Riley. She has lived her life solely to find her sister. All she wants to be is the perfect daughter her mother would never see her as. Her mother only wants her golden child back and makes sure Riley knows what a disappointment she has been in fulfilling this demand. The only thing Riley dislikes more than talking to her mother is the time between cases when she has only her incessant cycle of doubts swirling around in her head to keep her company. She's been forced into a week off to recover from the last case. A week on her own without access to FBI resources to continue her own search for her sister is not Riley's ideal vacation. She has no idea how to stop and take a breathe.<br /><br />There is one person in her life that appreciates her for more than her brilliant profiling abilities. Thayne Blackwood, a Navy Seal who came home to take care of his father but ended up taking care of his town, has been carrying on a long distant flirtation with Riley. That is about to change because his sister was kidnapped and he has asked Riley to help find her. He called her regularly over the last year but when he came back to the States to care for his father, his family, and his town, he never bothered to tell her. It was never the right time. He needed her now though. He needed her more than ever.<br /><br />The twists at the end of this book were brilliantly woven into story.

{"rating": 5, "title": "Get this book...not the other one that looks like this book", "text": "Sex, drugs, and rock & roll; girls, muscle cars, and muscle.  These are just a few things society says are manly pursuits.  To combat the proliferation of sex and violence in the media, a lot of books in circulation written by well-intending Christians who hope to inspire men to be true men.  But many of those books miss the mark.<br /><br />&#34;The Dude's Guide to Manhood&#34;, however, hits the bulls-eye.  If there's ever to be a best-selling book dealing with guy issues and man stuff, then this will be it.  The author, Darrin Patrick, pulls no punches and he hides behind no bushes.  He tells it like it needs to be told, but not in a condemning or condescending way. Instead, Patrick encourages and inspires with true wisdom that does not come across as being &#34;preachy&#34;.<br /><br />CONTENTS:  Twelve chapters in 170 pages tell it like it is --<br />1 - Become a Determined Man<br />2 - Become a Coachable Man<br />3 - Become a Disciplined Man<br />4 - Become a Working Man<br />5 - Become a Content Man<br />6 - Become a Devoted Man<br />7 - Become a Family Man<br />8 - The Connected Man<br />9 - The Emotional Man<br />10 - The Fighting Man<br />11 - The Heroic Man<br />12 - Living as the Forgiven Man<br /><br />There are many insights and phrases I could quote to commend this book, but there's not enough space to cover it in a short book review.  Instead, I'd prefer to ask you a few questions: &#34;How do you want to be remembered when you're gone?&#34;  &#34;When people speak about you, what will they say about your character?&#34; &#34;Before drifting off to sleep each night, what kind of character did you display that day?&#34;<br /><br />This book is about all those things that truly make great men great -- and it's not about surrounding themselves with pretty women, flashy clothes, big muscles, and expensive cars.  It's about being a role model for your sons to imitate (p.19); It's about being an employee who can be trusted and respected (p.52); It's about making your woman's character beautiful (p.78); It's about taking risks when it matters (p.90); It's about being simultaneously tough and tender (p.127).<br /><br />ITS EFFECT ON ME: There were several times when I had to put the book down and reflect upon my own life and character.  What was truly remarkable about the book is how Patrick accomplished that: he proclaimed biblical manliness without throwing the Bible at me.  Using God's truth, Patrick cut to the heart using godly principles.<br /><br />Knowing Patrick's desire for godliness AND manliness, however, I was pleased with his concluding chapters.  He wasn't content to leave his readers thinking it was just OK to one day die as a well-respected &#34;good man&#34;. Instead, I think he earns the trust of his readers by the way he presented this message through the first 10 chapters to introduce them to Jesus Christ -- the Man of men.  I think it was good timing and was presented tastefully.  Trusting the Sovereign to save, Patrick concludes the book instructing men how to live as new men -- forgiven men -- men of God.<br /><br />RATING: Without a doubt, I give &#34;The Dude's Guide to Manhood&#34; 5 stars.  I'd give 6 if it were possible, but 5 is the cut-off.  I highly recommend this book to all men for themselves and as a gift for young men.  Mom's -- pick one up as a gift for the son in your life...but be careful how you give a copy to your husband or boyfriend.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I received this book free of charge from Book Look Bloggers in exchange for my unbiased review of it.

{"rating": 4, "title": "I recently received a copy of Miscarried Joy by Tanika Fitzgerald", "text": "I recently received a copy of Miscarried Joy by Tanika Fitzgerald. As many of you know, I went through a miscarriage of my own last year and I thought this book may offer some encouragement to me and also be a good resource to refer other to, as well.<br /><br />I immediately connected to Tanika's story because she miscarried right around the same time that I did. As a woman who has miscarried and felt alone, it was somewhat of a quick connection to the author.<br /><br />There were many aspects of this book that I enjoyed. Tanika is obviously a strong Christian woman as that is evident through her words. She and her husband have been dealt much hardship through their miscarriages and have been able to see God through that.<br /><br />I was impressed with just how much scripture Tanika was able to pull into her book to relate it back to the circumstances of barrenness. Miscarried Joy was packed with God's word and it all was completely relevant, in my opinion.<br /><br />One aspect of the book that was difficult for me was that Tanika miscarried for the first time in June or July of 2015 as well as one or two times after that, however, she wrote a book within a year of that first miscarriage. I'm not saying she isn't the right person to write a book about this because she has obviously dealt with it in her personal life. I just thought it interesting that she had written a book so quickly.

{"rating": 2, "title": "I was disappointed in this", "text": "As a preface to my remarks - I'm a 61 year old pharmacist who met his wife while in pharmacy school in 1979. My wife works about 12 hours a week as a Kroger pharmacist plus full time at Eli Lilly's. We've been married for more than 31 years. I have worked many, many holidays (for example I've worked 25 Thanksgivings since 1982). We, according to the book, reside in lower Richistan. We own a few rental proerties close by.<br /><br />I liked the first part of the book but the longer I read the less I liked it. On page 5 the author wrote, 'The purpose of my journey isn't to take sides in this debate. I haven't set out to condemn the rich, or to turn them into heroes.'<br /><br />IMHO he ends up doing both by the end - especially if it involved Nuking the evil GOP.<br /><br />On page 38 he says that by 1890 the top 1% held about 50% of the nations wealth. On page 39 he says that was just over 20% by the late 1970's. But 1989 the number was 30% and by 2004 it was 33%.<br /><br />Obviously this % varies widely over time but he made me feel he felt that the 33% was a serious problem today.<br /><br />On page 198 he quotes Ted Gill about punishing the GOP over gay rights. But on page 194 he quotes Jared Polis, 'I think that sexual orientation, like religion or race has --nothing-- to do with ones values and to most people it's not important one way or the other'. Since these two are 1/2 of the Gang of Four in Colorado who Nuked the GOP it's interesting the author says on page 188 - 'Yet the stories of Jared Polis and Tim Gill offer another, more hopeful sign for the effect of money on politics.'<br /><br />But the author is not going to take sides? He is not against using money in politics if he being used to Nuke the GOP??<br /><br />Interesting - I doubt few people who will agree with the quote about religion, race or sexual orientation having nothing to do with ones values let alone their opinions or how they vote. IMHO more people have been killed in the name of a religion than any other reason.<br /><br />Many of the 'facts' he quotes end up being from talking to a handful of rich people who may or may not be telling the truth. If a drug company tried to get a drug approved with 'facts' like these they would never get any drug passed.<br /><br />A few comments on the middle classes problems - many traditional middle class jobs are gone or will be soon (ie - manufacturing, etc). And for a long time people were told go to college and get a degree - any degree.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many first time college students were lied to. You must (IMHO) find a degree that has long term viability as it costs the same to get a nursing education as a English degree, for example. On average the RN will have more opportunities and make more money for the same time and money cost for college. I was the 1st person on my dads side to go to college let alone graduate or get multiple degrees (I also have 2 computer degrees in addition to my pharmacy one). My 1st choice was to be a high school chemistry teacher and coach football. In fact, I probably would have been happy doing that EXCEPT I realized I wanted more money and opportunities. I didn't want to be merely be doing ok and thus changed my mind<br /><br />ALSO - many of the degrees that pay more (and have more opportunities) have fairly high failure rates (my pharmacy class started with 149 and 84 made it including a few dropping back to my class from my wife's plus a handful of transfers from other colleges). In other words only about 50% made it. But that short term pain (and boy was the competition fierce) has resulted in long term financial rewards. Of course, no one can tell the future, but you can look at long term trends (like demographics) and thus make a better decision for your own future.<br /><br />Hardly anyone wants the middle class to go bust - we should be trying to lift all boats as this what our country was built on - everyone with a little luck and hard work (and paying attention) can improve their lot in life.<br /><br />Just remember  -  the decisions you make today will shape the life you will have in the future.<br /><br />I would rate this 3.75 to 4.25 out of 10 stars. This was missed opportunity to really examine the rich and the decline of the middle class.<br /><br />SHORT UPDATE 8/16/14 - I've found that the books by Stanley (Millionaire Next Door, etc) to be more based on provable facts and much more useful in attainting my financial goals. All of the millionaires I know are closer to his presentation of the facts than this book. Anyone can achieve what I've done with hard work coupled with paying attention to what's happening in the world. If you want to be rich in a year -play the lottery. If you want to be 'rich' (at least a net worth of $1 to 2 million) by 50 or so it can be done by nearly anyone.", "images": [], "asin": "0307341453", "parent_asin": "0307341453", "user_id": "AGFI2KQRYSFBUCTGFXOUNZZQT3ZQ", "timestamp": 1381635477000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

They are beautiful and useful and a special link to a loved one.  This years addition did not disappoint.

I respect Mrs.Hart\u2019s beliefs, if that is the issue here.  I still give  Victoriana calendar 5 stars, because how could I not with all the lovely extras!

Next, 4 large postcards on sturdy paper.  2 designs suitable for Valentine\u2019s Day, one for Christmas and a kind of random one I won\u2019t use as it has to do with Scrapbooking but others might.  Those usually come every year.  But in honor of the 30th Anniversary there is also included a large page of stickers!  A nice surprise to find when you open your calendar.  Several are quite large, and they are fun and adorable and I look forward to using them!

We meet her at age twelve, where much of the focus in the narrative is on what happens to her mother on her 41st birthday.  We next meet Denny in her mid-twenties, as she returns to her native Ohio to sort through her things before her mother moves to New York City.  The final section of the novel takes place during Denny's mid-thirties, where she faces what could be a life-altering decision to assume responsibility for the son of a dear friend, Maureen.  The writing in What to Keep is excellent, but the novel lacks, I don't know, that little extra oomph for a five-star rating.

{"rating": 2, "title": "I'm embarrassed to admit I read this", "text": "X-Rated Bloodsuckers is completely forgettable. The 2nd installment of the Felix Gomez series follows the same pattern of good pacing paired with a lack of characterization and complicated plot with a slapdash ending. On the plus side, I read the first book in the series (Nymphos of Rocky Flats) and thus was not expecting much from this book to begin with, so I can't say I was especially disappointed. Fortunately, I borrowed this from a friend rather than pay full price, and recommend you do the same if you absolutely have to read it.<br /><br />The plot begins with Felix getting called to Los Angeles by porn actress Katz Meow to investigate the murder of her friend and fellow adult-film star Roxy Bronze. Conveniently, the Araneum--the secret society of vampire police--also request Felix's involvement in L.A. to investigate and exterminate anyone connected with a vampire-human collusion, which they believe may be connected to porn king Cragnow Vissoom and leader of the Los Angeles nidus (vampires), who was also Roxy's former producer.<br /><br />Shortly upon Felix's arrival, he is tapped by Coyote, a local vampire who claims to be the reason Felix was summoned to L.A. by Katz Meow. Coyote is a comic foil for Felix, a caricature whose car consistently requires pushing in order to start, eats rat chorizos, and has an aggravating habit of speaking every second line in Espa\u00f1ol. Spanish--with the appropriate translation provided in English immediately following each line of foreign dialogue. Foreign words used once or twice in a story are colorful, but this gimmicky use of Spanish throughout the novel serves no purpose other that distracting the reader from the story.<br /><br />Plot turns lead Felix to a human chalice club (a club where humans \"owned\" by vampires willingly serve themselves up as food), to city hall and Councilwoman Venin, a Christian televangelist, a surgeon, a local community humanitarian for whom Felix develops an attraction, and various adult film stars. These multiple suspects mean that no clear-cut evidence exists to leave a trail of bread crumbs for Felix or the reader to solve the mystery. In fact, Felix manages to solve the case through sheer dumb luck when a guilty party confesses his involvement at the end in attempt to save his own life.<br /><br />In addition to the poorly-planned plot, there are several unexplained holes in the logic of the vampire society that exists in the novel:  vampires cast no reflection; their skin is translucent; and their eyes contain a tapetum lucidum--a lens animals possess which reflects like back through  the retina and makes them appear to shine in the dark. Given these extraordinary traits, the author maintains the logic that an entire society of vampires has remained hidden for thousands of years by the use of make-up and sun-block to hide their complexions, contact lenses, and strategically avoiding mirrors! In one scene, Felix conveniently has the waiter seat himself and a date in a different section of the restaurant to avoid a mirror on the wall. There is no rationale is provided to explain the existence of vampire powers to include levitation, paranormal strength, transformation into animals, and immortality. The author has conveniently selected various tropes from the vampire mythology to fuel the story and made no effort to rework them.<br /><br />So, if you like mindless entertainment, vampires, and the kitschy use of sexy titles to attract readers, then X-Rated Bloodsuckers might be the book for you. If you prefer logic-based fantasy worlds where the vampire mythology is somehow explained or rewritten with a new and interesting spin, then X-Rated Bloodsuckers is definitely not your cup of tea.", "images": [], "asin": "0061438871", "parent_asin": "0061438871", "user_id": "AFTAMLARPKGWOFOYCMPUV7WVA62Q", "timestamp": 1256606076000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 2, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 1, "title": "Why wite this kind of book?", "text": "I am at a loss to understand why this kind of book is ever written.  The only people interested are those who remember Sal Mineo and who enjoyed his work.  If they had any illusions, they certainly won't have now!  The author meticulously lists and dates every film, TV, game show, radio appearance, and personal appearance - all of which can be gained from the IMDB web site.  He also quotes from interviews with contemporaries (mostly deceased) and must have combed through every news clipping and magazine article ever published.  Why?  the end result is a character assassination which will turn off those who admired Sal Mineo.  Other than a warning to young actors to KEEP YOUR FAMILY OUT OF YOUR CAREER! I cannot see the point of this biography.<br /><br />Sal Mineo was an exceptionally handsome and talented actor, with two academy award nominations while still in his teens, who became a teenage idol in his early teens.  Sadly his promising career was unintentionally sabotaged by his mother who was a rank amateur and his typecasting as a juvenile delinquent/angry teenager.  Where he should have been under contract to a major studio and managed by a professional Hollywood manager who knew the ropes and could guide and protect their young star, he was managed by his mother who had no idea how to play with the big boys.  In addition, his freeloading family saw him as a meal ticket with unlimited resources charging everything from a mansion in Mamaronek, to expensive clothes and hotels to him.  His parents had a business which did not make enough to support the lifestyle to which they felt the family of a movie star warranted. His mother accepted any movie role offered and as a result he was type cast as a juvenile delinquent. No matter how much he earned (which really wasn't all that much) he could not make enough to support his family's extravagance.<br /><br />Sadly, not having the guidance of a Hollywood agent and not being under contract to a major studio, he was virtually an outside with no idea how to get back in. When the targeted audience matured and moved on, he was trapped in an image of the 50's that was passe.  A savvy agent would have carefully chosen his roles to move his career from teen idol to mature actor.  Despite his attempts to move on, with roles in films like exodus, he slid to exploitation B pictures, TV movies and game shows, ending with borderline pornography.  In many ways he was also his own worst enemy as he descended into independent production of risque material, drug abuse and an 'in your face' homosexual lifestyle.  The account of his eventual murder does not ring true.  Given the company he kept, the constant lawsuits, the money he owed and disregarded and his general free loading lifestyle, his murder sounds more like a deliberate hit.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as a cautionary tale along the lines of \"Don't put your daughter on the stage Mrs. Worthington\" as required reading for theatrical aspirants.", "images": [], "asin": "0307718689", "parent_asin": "0307718689", "user_id": "AFTG27WYZ3HMTSQPIT33OGBX5YZQ", "timestamp": 1295986086000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Starts off promising, then goes nowhere", "text": "Of all of Marvel's Ultimate books, Ultimate X-Men has always been the one I've liked the least, even when Mark Millar debuted it.  Cry Wolf finds Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Rogue, Iceman, Shadowcat, and Dazzler at the Coney Island fair, and the gang's fun comes to an end rather quickly when the cajun mutant for hire Gambit makes his presence felt and kidnaps Rogue.  The X-Men assemble and track them down, culminating in a predictable series of developments that ends with the team being short a member.  Considering that the Ultimate line is supposed to be new takes on classic stories, almost everything about Cry Wolf is predictable, right to it's ending.  What's even more surprising is that Brian K. Vaughn, a writer who has given us smashing comics like Y: The Last Man, Ex Machina, and Runaways, could come up with something as hokey as this, but then again, he probably didn't have much say in terms of plot development.  Not to mention that longtime fan favorite X-Man Gambit's characterization finds him reduced from an ultra cool character to a second rate player aching to have his backstory revealed.  Veteran X-Men artist Andy Kubert supplies his usual array of solid pencil work, but it's not enough to save Cry Wolf from being pretty mediocre.

Unfortunately, the ABC format of the book does not at all appeal to our six year old (\"ABC books are for toddlers,\" she stated), nor does it work for our toddler.  Our toddler, for example, doesn't understand why the lion appears on the page for \"Y\" (because the lion is yawning) instead of \"L.\"  It's a bit over her tot head.<br /><br />In sum, I don't think this book really works for any age.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Like you need another review...", "text": "I picked up this book after picking one of his articles \"The Naked Face\" from _The New Yorker_ for my Freshman Comp students to read, which he more or less cannibalized in one of the chapters in this book.  Yup, he plagiarized himself.  You bet I'm going to raise that issue with my students.<br /><br />Secondly, I didn't have a problem with his 'easy peasy' science as with the semi-socialist and contradictory conclusions about the whole 'thin slice' phenomenon.  In the penultimate chapter, he discusses the case of one Abbie Conant, who had to fight a horrendous legal battle to keep her position in an orchestra, all because the evil musicians made 'snap judgments' about her ability to play based on her gender--associating musicality with masculinity.  She got the job by auditioning from behind a screen.  Wonderful.  Yet, in the final chapter, where Gladwell is supposed to bring all of these disparate threads together, he suggests, I'm NOT kidding, that we have criminal defendants stand behind a screen as well, or be entirely removed from the courtroom, so that the judge can sentence them 'blind'.  This is comparing apples to fish.  When hiring a musician, one looks for musical ability.  When sentencing, I submit it's not beyond the purview of the bench to take into account such matters as 'does the defendant appear remorseful?' 'does he or she have future prospects of improvement?' 'does he or she have a history of recidivist behavior?' and other factors (beyond skin color) that weigh into a judge's decision.  Those factors *can* be assessed, as Gladwell himself argues, by 'thin slicing'.  Why is observing how a defendant behaves in the courtroom during the trial NOT acceptable thin slicing, when you ARE judging his character and ability to socially interact?  What he suggests is sentencing that a computer could do via a pretty simple algorithm.  We've TRIED mandatory sentencing and 'three strikes' policies, which attempt to remove race or class bias from the hands of judges (whom we apparently don't trust), and they didn't work.  Gladwell doesn't in the least suggest how his idea is really any different, or how it would be any more successful:  perhaps, if race is the issue, the issue is NOT with the judges but with the cops or district attorneys who decide to arrest or prosecute in the first case?  So, what?  Everyone's supposed to walk around with a bag over their heads so the (racist) cops can't see what color they are?  Crikey!<br /><br />Meanwhile, he doesn't address at all one of the more pressing, though smaller, perhaps, in scale, interests of the average reader: how can *I* use this in my life?  Not just 'buy cars on impulse, but debate about breakfast cereals', but in interpersonal interactions?  That's where most of his anecdotes focussed, but most of his prescriptions were not.  That sort of disconnect between ambitious social reform and interpersonal evidence is always suspect, because it leaves out the intermediate step: the small group.<br /><br />That being said, it's an easy read, and Gladwell is an entertaining stylist.  This is a book I'd recommend for plane trips or beach reading: enough to keep you interested, and intrigued, yet nothing that is going to significantly alter your paradigm.", "images": [], "asin": "0316010669", "parent_asin": "0316010669", "user_id": "AGZXNBVAVWJQPYO6LFGT66FKLBRA", "timestamp": 1185014241000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Spider Bones is Reichs' 13th book in her Temperance Brennan series, and I found much of this novel very interesting.<br /><br />Dr. Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who splits her time between Montreal and North Carolina.  While in Canada, a dead man is found in a rural lake.  It turns out that he was playing \"naughty nurse\" and died of \"accidental asphyxia associated with autoerotic activity.\"  But the real shocker comes when his prints are sent for identification, and the authorities learn that they belong to John Lowery.  The problem is that John Lowery died in a chopper crash in Vietnam in 1868 and was buried in his hometown in North Carolina.  Brennan is sent to North Carolina to exhume the remains in Lowery's grave to discover which one is the real John Lowery.<br /><br />The North Carolina remains are transported to Hawaii to JPAC (Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command) and Brennan is sent there as well to assist.  But then a third set of remains is discovered stored at JPAC, which makes the situation even more complicated.  Brennan also gets involved in a local case, which creates danger for her and those around her.<br /><br />I found the information and history about JPAC quite fascinating.  JPAC continuously works to locate missing military personnel from World War II (78,000+ missing), Korea (8,100+ missing), the Cold War (120 missing) and Vietnam (1800+ missing).  \"Core operations involve the pursuit of leads, the recovery of remains and artifacts, and the identification of individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.\" Large teams are needed to help JPAC including historians, analysts, and IT (Investigative Teams) made up of forensic anthropologists, linguists, medics, life support techs, forensic photographers, explosive ordinance disposal techs, divers, mountaineering specialists, etc.  Then more professionals are needed once the remains reach Hawaii.  On average 6 remains are identified each month.<br /><br />But while I found the JPAC information fascinating, I thought the subplot with Brennan's daughter, Katy, and Lily (the daughter of former lover Detective Andrew Ryan) downright stupid.  In fact, I find that Katy doesn't add much to this series. Also, the subplot about the Hawaiian drug dealers and local gangs was confusing and unnecessary. Reichs had enough going on with JPAC.<br /><br />I know that the television series based on this series, Bones, has become a big hit.  Personally, I think the books are so much better.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Stick to the Fundamentals", "text": "The author has written an eclectic rant. I am in branding, marketing and advertising but had not heard of Bob Hoffman until I happened across this book. Right upfront he recognizes that people in the industry are &#34;funny, cynical and immature bastards&#34;. Based on personal and professional feedback I would seem to fit that criteria. As such, I did enjoy the first third of the book but then it grew so sardonic and acidic that it was hard to appreciate the lessons in the messages.<br /><br />Advertising is a funny practice and profession. It is revered and reviled in equal amounts. I appreciate the author's attempt to hold it accountable and I totally agree that it has too long been focused on fancy tricks instead of recognizing the tried and true. Rather than dissect the contents, let me provide a few standout lines that resonated (these are not spoilers):<br /><br />- Hoffman writes that the marketing industry is under mass delusion that includes &#34;the gross exaggeration of the role of brands; the mangling of the role of ad agencies; the mistaking of gimmicks for trends&#34;<br /><br />- &#34;Marketers are taught not to think simply.&#34;<br /><br />- &#34;Advertising has always been 90% lousy, but online advertising has set a new standard for awfulness.&#34;<br /><br />- &#34;most of what we call 'brand loyalty' is simply habit, convenience, mild satisfaction or easy availability.&#34;<br /><br />The book is a series of short essays and blog posts so you can pick and choose topics that interest you.

Thing is, I didn\u2019t love it like I thought I would. I didn\u2019t hate it or anything, I just think it didn\u2019t work as well for me as it did with others.<br />Paris Peralta is found standing in her own bathroom covered in blood while holding a straight razor.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Left me in the dark.", "text": "Laurel doesn't fit with her New York family.  The child of a guardswoman and an unknown father, she's never fit with anyone least of all when she loses her temper and accidentally unleashes her magic.  So, she's shipped off to her uncle the lord Redmantyl to learn to control her power.  She digs through his libraries in search of knowledge until he's forced to take her as an apprentice for her own good.  And then the thespers arrived.<br /><br />I'm having a bit of a hard time thinking of what to say about Maiden in Light.  It felt like the author, Katheryn Ramage, had several stories that she wanted to tell but wasn't quite sure how to put them together.  From the blurb, as I read it on Goodreads, I expected to be dropped straight into the action.  I expected to start off with Laurel becoming her uncle's apprentice, then a few chapters of that, then going off to search out the bad thing.  Instead the first half or so of the book is taken up with a rambling account of what was apparently four years of Laurel's life starting with her journey to Wizardes Cliff.  This includes setting up several characters to be far more important than they were, events that had no bearing on the plot, and some fairly minimal characterization that could have been better taken care of with more show and less tell.  The second half of the book introduces the plot that was promised in the blurb only to instead jump into excruciating detail regarding Laurel's aunt's matchmaking and setting up for a conflict that never really happened.<br /><br />I'm going to get a bit more nitpicky here than usual, Maiden in Light had potential but that got buried in problems that really shouldn't be ignored.  The pacing was really bad, the first half of the book could have covered a few months, a few weeks, or a few years.  I really couldn't tell how much time was passing until someone mentioned someone else's age for a comparison.  There were two chapters back to back that detailed visits from traveling performers, known in the book as thespers, but there was no real indication that they hadn't done anything more than leave the gate and then come right back in.<br /><br />The book also tended to get dragged down in telling about a character rather than showing them.  The readers keeps hearing about how brave and smart and dedicated to her magic Laurel is, but when the chips are down all we get to see is a fragile little girl who doesn't know what she's supposed to be doing or how to go about it.  The reader is told how horrible the merchant class kids are to Laurel, but we only see one scene of them being snarky and a bit stupid before they are set aside for the rest of the book. I feel that I should also note that Laurel is a bit of a flat earth atheist, this may not bother anyone, but it was one of the tell instead of show things that seemed to come up way more than was necessary.<br /><br />The plot doesn't start until the book is more than half over, and then it's padded so heavily with the aunt trying to get her daughters married off that it gets lost.  Then Laurel suffers the kind of character derailment that makes me just want to stop reading, throws everything we've been told about her out the window with what might have been a clumsy attempt at symbolism and proceeds to ignore any previous characterization.<br /><br />The reader also gets treated to fanciful changes of spelling for names and places and changes of name for various holidays.  This doesn't lend to the world building but instead adds to the confusion regarding time passage and who's who and from where.  An alternate history does not necessarily lead to changes that radical in language, nor should it if only for the reader's sake.  I could let this slide if the world wasn't supposed to be earth with a different history but it just reads wrong as is.<br /><br />This leads me to the final part of this review.  With all the problems I had with the writing and the story itself, I wouldn't read anything else by Ramage.  Maiden in Light had potential, but it squandered that with blocks of purple tinted prose, tons of characters who came to nothing, and too much tell but no show.  I give Maiden in Light a one out of five.", "images": [], "asin": "0982581327", "parent_asin": "0982581327", "user_id": "AG457MWZMPAGAKMEZQDBCDSP3MMA", "timestamp": 1306516195000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

You would have wanted more than a single spare.

{"rating": 3, "title": "\"My mind was an angry dog, chasing after endless cars.\"", "text": "As the fourth novel in the Edie Spence series starts, Edie is in trouble again.  She's going on a long waited for vacation with her soulmate, the shapeshifter Asher, and it's a cruise, and maybe she's pregnant.  Edie's confused, can a fey actually get a mundane human pregnant? Well, the answer will surprise nobody, but until she knows for sure, she decides to keep Asher in the dark about this.<br /><br /> As Edie hates being on the high seas, she's either suffering from sea sickness or morning sickness.  Ah, what the heck, why not suffer from both?  Fun times.<br /><br /> But both Asher and Edie will have more to worry about than Edie's pregnancy as somebody from Asher's sordid background has resurfaced on their little cruise to happiness.<br /><br /> Cassie Alexander essentially flushes away all of Edie's past supporting cast and starts afresh with whole new plotlines and characters in an attempt to create a book that can be read independently.  Unfortunately, it's also a book that seems to take frigging forever to get started.  I had to struggle to keep reading, as while Alexander tosses us a hint or two as to what's coming, it really takes until almost page EIGHTY for anything to happen.<br /><br /> And then things go from bad to worse for Edie, as people start getting sick, and then people start getting dead, and Edie's condition starts getting worse, is she infected?  And the person behind everything seems to be Asher's old employer/enemy.<br /><br /> And then Edie becomes a mommy by proxy.<br /><br /> And if you think that things couldn't get any worse, the Shadows show up.  The Shadows are a race of wraithlike creatures that feed on strong negative emotions, and they're almost invulnerable, however, now they need Edie's help.  And they're scared.  Something bad is coming, and of course, this does nothing to calm Edie down as she can't conceive of anything that could scare the Shadows.<br /><br /> Then the dead, and the living, start mutating, as there is something that is growing inside them, and these things want out, out of their hosts.<br /><br /> About the halfway mark Alexander has clearly left this series' roots in the urban fantasy field long behind it, as with this novel gives us a plague, monsters, madness, madmen, mad scientists, murder, conspiracies, horror, terrorists, and lots of bloody death.  \"Deadshifted\" by Cassie Alexander eventually starts reading more like a novel as published by Permuted Press rather than an urban fantasy.<br /><br /> On the good side, this is a novel that actively puts Alexander's, and by proxy, Edie's medical background to really good use, and realistically portrays the selflessness of those that are dedicated nurses.  Kudos for this.<br /><br /> On the negative side, well, where does one begin?  The long drawn-out start of this novel is one.  Does it really take EIGHTY PAGES to start a novel?  No, it doesn't.<br /><br /> Then there is the ending.  Well, there isn't one.  There are too many plotlines left dangling, and the novel itself just kinda, sorta, more or less runs out of pages without wrapping anything up.<br /><br />******Spoilers ahead******<br /><br /> I wasn't surprised to find out that there are marine fey, but the rules seem rather vague.  Okay, mermaids can become landbound, but to do so they have change to a landbound creature.  And how do they do this?  Uh, good question.  Evidently they have to suck the air out of somebody, and then through sheer willpower they can change.  Oh yes, and they can change us mere mortals into fey if they want to.  How?  Good question.  It's never really answered, and why didn't this mermaid save her landbound husband?<br /><br /> And then there are the monsters that pop up after the three-quarter mark.  These creatures evolve inside people and then destroy the hosts, escape to the sea, and replicate,  So what happens to the thousands that are now loose in the ocean?  Aw heck, why ask?<br /><br /> Then about the Leviathan that has the Shadows running so scared?  This thing is massive, and it's a shipkiller, and it's loose in the ocean.  Loose.  Plot.  Thread.<br /><br /> And then there is what eventually happens to Edie.  Clearly Alexander has either no respect for her audience, or she had written herself into a corner.  However, even I can see where Alexander took a wrong turn here.  I don't like these stupid cliffhangers, or these open endings.  They're crass money grabs, and they are a form of literary blackmail that demands that the reader fork over their cash and time for the next novel.<br /><br /> Edie has always been a mortal woman, feisty to be sure, but still a mortal woman trying to deal with the much stronger paranormal, and keep her head above water while doing this.  As such, she represented the everywoman that the reader could identify with.  Well, forget that now, Edie's not going to be Edie anymore.<br /><br /> And considering the dire direction that this series is bound and determined to go, I'm not sure I even care to read or buy any of the future novels in this series.  Because of all of these faults, and because of Edie's constant boneheaded decisions, I almost gave this book two stars, but the book's last half, until the god awful last few pages, does rock.  But really, Alexander is just coasting here, and the stakes are high, there's just too much to read to keep giving us these duds.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Another Disappointment from Ehrenreich", "text": "For some unfathomable reason, I keep hoping that Barbara Ehrenreich will finally produce an insightful analysis of something. This never happens, however, and the only thing I take away from her books is a sense of disappointment. Ehrenreich's latest subject seemed so promising that I bought her book. She takes on the perennial cheerfulness, perkiness, and optimism that characterizes (to use Terry Eagleton's beautiful phrase) \"the genetically upbeat Americans.\"<br /><br />Positive thinking, says Ehrenreich, is \"beginning to be an obligation imposed on all American adults.\" Ehrenreich describes the constant efforts to promote positive thinking within companies that, according to her, are now seeping into the academic world. I don't know much about the corporate world and whether the cheery mood is obligatory there. I do know, however, that Ehrenreich is completely wrong when she says that cheerfulness and positive thinking are becoming popular in academia. Academics are the whiniest bunch of people you will ever meet. We love bitching, complaining, moaning, and sighing. Recently, I have been feeling simply ecstatic about my new job, but I can see that even the people who gave me the job in question are being repelled by my enthusiasm. Everybody expects me to complain and when I don't my fellow academics seem a little disoriented.<br /><br />Ehrenreich believes that human beings are nothing more than tiny little objects at the mercy of blind forces beyond our comprehension. She is a fierce materialist who believes that our circumstances are the only thing that defines our lives. She is consequently very annoyed by any worldview that believes in the possible victory of spirit over matter. In her opinion, thinking that you can achieve anything you want if you work really hard at it and want it really badly is wrong because it obscures reality. Apparently, she cannot accept that everybody's version of reality is very different and that some people might be justified in shaping their own reality.<br /><br />Ehrenreich's one-dimensional materialism seems boring and overly aggressive. She insists that your happiness depends on your income, an idea that is profoundly alien to me. I accept her right to be an atheist and a materialist. I don't think that any one deserves scorn and ridicule for possessing this worldview. It would be nice to see Ehrenreich respond in kind to people who are religious and/or seek other explanations than the purely materialistic type that she promotes. I, for one, do believe that human beings have a lot more agency in the world that Ehrenreich allows for (I mean, I have a lot more agency. If Ehrenreich doesn't want this agency, then she definitely shouldn't try to exercise it.)<br /><br />The author's hatred of motivational speakers is so profound that she is even willing to present the most notorious Wall Street criminals as poor unwitting victims of the \"positive thinking\" movement. According to Ehrenreich, Joe Gregory, the former president of Lehman's Brothers, is not really guilty of his company's collapse. It's the bad, mean, positive-thinking ideology that makes people believe they can achieve anything they want that is to blame for his actions and the company's demise. It is very surprising to see a hard-core liberal like Ehrenreich giving an absolution to a bunch of greedy individuals like Gregory, but there it is.<br /><br />It seems that Ehrenreich read too many self-help books in the process of doing research for Bright-sided and couldn't help but borrow some of their tricks. She decides to end her book with a piece of advice on how we should conduct our lives: \"The alternative to both [positive thinking and depression] is to try to get outside of ourselves and see things 'as they are,' or as uncolored as possible by our own feelings and fantasies.\" At least, Ehrenreich has the good sense of putting \"as they are\" in quotation marks. This demonstrates that the author herself is a little ashamed of her childishly naive way of offering advice to people whose worldview might be a little bit more complicated than her reductive materialism.<br /><br />To summarize: the book is boring, uninsightful, poorly constructed, unconvincing, and intellectually barren.", "images": [], "asin": "0805087494", "parent_asin": "0805087494", "user_id": "AEJP557V5GGMT74RJBHACELPQGUA", "timestamp": 1275761801000, "helpful_vote": 94, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 1, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 4, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Picture Your Dead", "text": "What I liked best about this book was the scrapbook pages before and after each chapter.  Pictures, letters and little mementos were drawn by the illustrator (Lisa Brown) to accompany Jennie's memories and stories.  The process of taking pictures of the dead wasn't unknown to me before now; there were several such pictures at family member's old house and though its creepy it was highly fascinating at the same time.<br /><br />What didn't work as well for me was Jennie's narration.  I'm not entirely certain why, just that no matter how interested I became in the story Jennie would draw me out of it almost immediately.  She had a very formal sound to her voice, not stiff exactly, but as if sharing the story wasn't the first thing she wanted to do.<br /><br />I know very little about Civil War America, as far as the culture and what happened outside of the battles is concerned.  It was fascinating to read about Jennie's family and in hindsight what she couldn't see about her Aunt and Uncle, or even her cousins, she observes and discounts.  She observed her cousin Quinn's odd behavior from the first, but chose to discount it.  She was so worried about not being tossed out (now that her fiancee was gone) she didn't want to see I think.<br /><br />The ending is darkly hilarious--secrets are laid out and Jennie finally gets back her own.

The other reviewers have detailed the plot.  This book didn't make sense to me. Why would the villian, Rob, after just being released from prison put himself in the position to land back in prison?  He was aware of the other murder he committed.  It seems to me he would have tried to live his life as quietly as possible.  The premise is he wanted a new trial, even though he served all his required time, to clear his name.  Clearing his name was important to him because it would allow him to be reinstated in his wealthy grandmother's will.  Great, but Rob WAS guilty of this  murder as well as another murder that he was never even suspected of.  Ellie, the heroine, became obsessed with PROVING his guilt only after Rob announced his desire for a new trial.  Ellie's probing into Rob's background opened a can of worms.  She discovered he committed another similar murder as well as attempted murder.  Rob's purpose for wanting a new trial was to receive a $100.000 inheritance from his grandmother.  He was already wealthy.  His parents were wealthy.  He risked his guilty neck for another $100,000.  It doesn't make sense.  He had much more to lose than to gain.  I didn't like Ellie.  She was very closed minded. Unfortunately, since the entire book was written from her perspective I couldn't like the book because I didn't like her.  Finally, there was no suspense.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The birth of psychohistory dawns", "text": "&quot;Why, he wondered, did so many people spend their lives not trying to find answers to questions\u2014not even thinking of questions to begin with? Was there anything more exciting in life than seeking answers?&quot;<br /><br />After five novels spanning as many centuries, one might have supposed Asimov's stepwise tinkering with his Foundation universe had come to an end. The adventures of Golan Trevize, Janov Pelorat, and Bliss concluded in Foundation and Earth (1983), with a finale as intellectually rewarding as it was thematically resonant. Trevize gained the validation he desired for choosing Gaia (or proto-Galaxia) over the Seldon Plan. But just five short years later, again at the behest of avid fans and pushy publishers, Asimov picked up the series once more, this time in the form of a prequel. As its name suggests, Prelude to Foundation (1986) was the first of two prequels setting up the events of the original Foundation novel released in 1951.<br /><br />For most of the series, psychohistory's founder, Hari Seldon, is this enigmatic figure spoken of only in cryptic, quasi-spiritual terms, rather like a demigod. Little is known about the man other than that he was a mathematical genius whose equations helped shepherd humanity through a series of increasingly existential crises. In Prelude Seldon's saintly aura is stripped away as we are introduced to the young, martial arts-trained professor laboring to turn his coveted psychohistory into a practical, applied science.<br /><br />The first act opens on the planet Trantor, the Empire's capital, as Dr. Seldon presents his seminal paper at the Decennial Mathematics Convention. In a decision he soon comes to regret, he lays out a theoretical method by which the future can be determined probabilistically. The key word here is 'theoretical', a detail those with a hankering for control over the world order seem uniformly disposed to overlook. In Seldon's own words:<br /><br />&quot;And I went on to show that this would result in the ability to predict future events in a statistical fashion\u2014that is, by stating the probability for alternate sets of events, rather than flatly predicting that one set will take place.&quot;<br /><br />News of his work spreads like a thunderbolt. Emperor Cleon I himself arranges a meeting, in the hope that he can use Seldon's abilities as a means toward self-preservation. Haunted by the specter of assassination, Cleon is dismayed upon learning that psychohistory is not yet ready for primetime. He's not about to risk it falling into the hands of his enemies, however, and orders his right-hand man, First Minister Eto Demerzel, to keep close tabs on Seldon's progress. Demerzel is a shadowy character whose influence penetrates each of the disparate sectors on Trantor. Seldon now has a target on his back. Indeed, it seems he is now the most important person in all of the Galaxy, with the powers that be all wishing to profit from a mature psychohistory.<br /><br />Before Seldon can return to his home world of Helicon, he runs into one Chetter Hummin, an intrepid journalist who warns Seldon of the Emperor's intentions. Like Cleon, Hummin also seeks a functional psychohistory. His aims prove more noble than the former's, as he anticipates it being used to divert the Empire from its path of rotting decay. Seldon, meanwhile, harbors strong doubts that his mathematics actually possess the potential his benefactors so eagerly seek, but Hummin is able to convince him that his research will be for the good of humanity. After dispatching a couple of the Emperor's goons, they flee to a nearby university in Streeling Sector, where Seldon can tend to his work in relative safety.<br /><br />There he meets Dors Venabili, a historian and the second protagonist in this outing. She agrees to watch over Seldon and assist him with his studies. Dors' larger role in the narrative is shrouded in mystery and isn't fully explored until the second prequel. In this outing she serves as an eloquent sounding board for Seldon's frequent riffs and ruminations, while her strong-willed and circumspect presence nicely balance her counterpart's impetuosity and fitful naivete over the course of their journeys. Thankfully for Seldon, she is also quite capable of kicking ass when only violent options present themselves.<br /><br />Seldon's stint at the university is short-lived, as he is unable to escape the feeling that his every move is being watched by the Emperor and his minions. Following a close encounter in which Seldon's reckless actions nearly get him killed, Hummin relocates Seldon and Dors to Mycogen Sector, an underground society on Trantor proper that is believed to possess some of the oldest records in the Galaxy. It is thought that by simulating an earlier period of history where the moving parts were decidedly smaller in both scale and in number, this will greatly simplify Seldon's intractable task of mathematizing human societies.<br /><br />It wouldn't be an Asimov novel without heaping sexism, and Mycogen serves it in spades. As thoroughly patriarchal as it is puritanical, Mycogen is a world in which the subservience of women has been raised to an organizing principle. In public, men speak only to men; women are never to address men, much less outsiders like Hari and Dors, outside the privacy of their own home. Seldon exploits the situation, manipulating one of the women to obtain their sacred book, hoping it may hold the clues he needs to perfect his theory. The book appears to be a dead-end, but it does lead Seldon to believe that the Mycogenians are protecting one big secret: a 20,000 year-old robot holed up in their Sacratorium\u2014a museum-cum-temple of sorts dedicated to remembering their past glory on the home world Aurora.<br /><br />The site is off-limits to off-worlders, so Seldon and Dors don disguises and sneak inside. They do in fact find a robot, albeit defunct. In the process they are &quot;caught&quot; by one of the High Elders, an artificer whose machinations had lured the duo into a trap; rather than Seldon doing the manipulating, it was he who was beguiled into following a course of action pursuant to Mycogenian interests. The Elder had been in communication with the Emperor, and sought to strike a deal in turning Seldon over to Imperial authorities for his sacrilegious breach of custom. Seemingly always in the right place at the right time, Hummin intervenes by playing up psychohistory's potential for furthering Mycogen's interests. The Elder reluctantly agrees to forget the whole ordeal, reneges on his arrangement with the Emperor, and allows the trio to depart Mycogen for good. (Hmm...)<br /><br />Hummin shuttles them off to another of Trantor's sectors known as Dahl. Not only is their purpose for going here unexplained, their stay in Dahl is one of the weaker sections of the book. Were it not for introducing important characters who play a larger role in the sequel, there would be little to recommend its place in the story. Seldon meets a precocious factory worker named Yugo Amaryl whom he promises a job after seeing some scribbled equations Amaryl had been working on in his spare time. Amaryl also mentions a wise woman known as Mother Rittah who holds ancient knowledge about Earth\u2014the original home of humanity and, Seldon hopes, an ideal case study for psychohistory.<br /><br />Seldon and Dors venture into the slummy Billibotton District in search of Rittah, where they are set upon by a swarm of knife-wielding miscreants. Dors makes quick work of them, an experienced knife-fighter herself. Shortly thereafter they befriend a homeless, alley-smart twelve year-old named Raych who leads them to the oracle. She reveals to them that the Mycogenians' lost world Aurora was actually the robot world that destroyed Earth (cue the Robot series!).<br /><br />Dahl authorities catch wind of their antics and send a pair of constables to question them. Threatened with arrest, Seldon and Dors knock out the officers, putting our heroes permanently on the run. Fortunately, Raych leads them to safety, when a mysterious soldier shows up on orders to escort Seldon away from Dahl. Raych, Dors and Seldon all end up in Wye\u2014a sector at Trantor's south pole\u2014whose mayor (Rashelle) has been biding her time as she plots the usurpation of Emperor Cleon's throne. Rashelle's plan would allow her to gain full control of Trantor and its various sectors while relinquishing all Imperial command of the isolate planets. Seldon, she believes, is the ace in the hole required to carry out her grand act of sedition.<br /><br />Seldon wants no part in this scheme, and for good reason: he now knows how to make psychohistory practical. Through his diverse cultural experiences in each of the sectors spread across Trantor, he realizes Trantor itself will serve as the perfect model for developing his inchoate science, which can then be generalized to the rest of the twenty-five million worlds populating the Galaxy. At least, that's the idea. But if Rashelle's coup comes to fruition, the Galaxy would be plunged into anarchy, menaced by a neverending series of territorial disputes and sanguinary transfers of power. If Seldon is to mature his science and stave off the destruction to come, the Empire must remain at peace.<br /><br />As if on cue, Rashelle's plot is foiled as the soldiers under her command no longer assent to her orders. Hummin arrives on the scene and the remaining pieces fall into place. We learn that Hummin is none other than...Cleon's confidant and advisor Eto Demerzel. Moreover, he's not actually a human at all, but the legendary robot named R. Daneel Olivaw, whom Trevize and crew meet in the conclusion to Foundation and Earth. Further still, Hummin / Demerzel / Olivaw possesses mentalic powers (\u00e0 la the Mule) enabling him to subtly manipulate the emotions of others. This explains Seldon's drive to perfect psychohistory despite his earlier skepticism, the High Elder's leniency on Mycogen, and Rashelle's failed scheme, among other improbable feats of chance.<br /><br />Having lived the last 20,000 years, Demerzel sees the approaching collapse of the Empire as inevitable and psychohistory as the mechanism by which to minimize the fallout. Thus, in accordance with the Zeroth Law\u2014&quot;A robot may not harm humanity, or through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm&quot;\u2014he intervenes just enough to nudge events in Seldon's favor.<br /><br />Prequel Fever<br /><br />Critics have been somewhat harsh on this entry, and not without reason, the most fundamental perhaps being that Seldon's quest for a workable psychohistory just isn't all that compelling. What made the earlier novels so memorable was exploring the limits of psychohistory and seeing whether the next great challenge was acidic enough to dissolve the Seldon Plan. The cerebral acrobatics of navigating the contours of each successive crisis as the Galaxy tests its fate against the provisions of ancient prophecies forms the bread and butter of the Foundation series. Sure, Prelude contains all the twists and bombshell reveals characteristic of Asimovian fiction, but the humble beginnings of Seldon's Big Idea fail to reach the epic heights imparted by the settings that have so endeared generations of readers.<br /><br />Delving too much into origins also comes at a cost. There's a certain mystique surrounding psychohistory\u2014one of the most inventive and successful concepts in all of science fiction\u2014that isn't helped by reductive exposition. By cutting the enormity of psychohistory down to size, some of the series' allure invariably wisps away. More problematic is the lackluster execution of the reveal. There is no single ground-shaking discovery or torrent of insight that sets Seldon on the right path, no &quot;Eureka!&quot; moments that lead him to his statistical laws. He just wakes up one morning and says he's worked it out. (No, literally that's what happens.) We're supposed to believe his traipsing around Trantor set him on the right course to a solution. That's at best unsatisfying, even if it's naive to expect juicy insights into what are ultimately fictional concepts with little chance of being mapped onto reality. But as plot devices go, it's pretty tame.<br /><br />What's more, the places they visit fail to inspire and feel thrown in merely to bridge Asimov's various fictional projects. A lot of space in this book is tied up in external references to the Robot and Empire series\u2014in asides that aren't particularly purposeful in and of themselves. The robot subplot on Mycogen and the preoccupation with the Aurora-Earth connection, for example, make for interesting sync points with the Asimov corpus, but don't do much heavy lifting in progressing the central plot of Prelude. Asimov notes in the introduction that unification was not what he had in mind when these stories were conceived, and devoted greater effort to the task later in his career. It certainly shows, but surely it's not worth the confusion readers unfamiliar with his other stories are sure to experience.<br /><br />As for plot holes, there might be one relating to Olivaw. He has supposedly functioned as Demerzel, counselor to the Imperial throne, for decades, and is frequently referred to as the most influential person in the Galaxy, even more so than Cleon himself. He has connections with sectors all across Trantor. Yet no one knows what he looks like, or that Hummin and Demerzel are the same person? Or, rather, is it that Olivaw lulls them into forgetfulness? With the mind control mechanic, one can never be sure. (I had the same issue with Jessica Jones, alas.)<br /><br />There is also the obligatory caveat about character development. As we've come to accept from this series (and from Asimov in general), the individuals on the page serve largely as mouthpieces for Asimov's ever active, idea-saturated mind. What 'development' we do get is intellectual in nature, as Seldon puzzles out solutions to psychohistory. Where such shortcomings might be given a pass in earlier novels, overshadowed as they were by the larger arc built into the narrative, they're more visible wrapped inside a more confined and chronologically compact story.<br /><br />What is unique about Prelude, however slight a difference it makes in the end, is that Hari Seldon is widely thought to be modeled after Asimov himself. Ruthlessly logical, chronically inquisitive and never satisfied he has the final answer in hand, Seldon is the hardened intellectual Asimov embodied throughout his illustrious career. The recurring problem, however\u2014and Prelude once again fails to break the mold\u2014is the supporting cast, who is every bit as effortlessly logical and thorough as Seldon. Each of the characters he interacts with, even the oppressed women on Mycogen, go toe to toe with Seldon's brilliance. They speak the same way, they reason the same way. The criticisms of previous entries thus still stand: the dialogue reads largely as an exchange between scholars than as variegated, down-to-earth human beings with diverse flaws and personalities and cognitive talents to boot. It's all the more ironic given that social complexity is presented as the critical plot device underwriting psychohistory's evolution from concept to reality.<br /><br />The Alignment Problem<br /><br />What if robots get there first? One point raised by Dors is the implications of reducing human behavior to mathematical laws. \u201cHow horrible,&quot; said Dors. \u201cYou are picturing human beings as simple mechanical devices. Press this button and you will get that twitch.\u201d Seldon's attempt to bring quadrillions of people under computational control puts Dors ill at ease despite the benevolent impulse behind it. But should this give us pause as well? After all, whether we will be able to model our actions to this extent is irrelevant, because our future AI companions most certainly will.<br /><br />And this dovetails directly with the alignment problem in AI\u2014the notion that the goals of superintelligent AI may ultimately prove inconsistent with human well-being or the preservation of our species. Any dynamic, self-modifying superintelligence will eventually understand human behavior at the level of the brain. At that point, their intelligence and capabilities will have far surpassed our own and we may come to be viewed as lesser beings, of trivial consequence to the universe. The fundamental worry is that sufficiently advanced AI will graduate from mechanical servants to omniscient overlords and treat us the way we treat cattle or insects. Perhaps then we would need something like an AI Mule on our side to out-manipulate rogue AI. The future of AI systems will be nothing if not interesting.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br /><br />Prelude to Foundation is the story of how psychohistory was born. We learn more about the Delphic Hari Seldon (who knew he could hold it down in a fight?) and how he managed to see the future in terms of probabilities. Through expository jaunts on Trantor, he meets a range of characters who cause him to see his project in a different light and who will play pivotal roles in the events to come. Many interactions seem to exist for the sole purpose of tying in his Robot and Empire series. While some may find these tangents distracting, they do add more texture to Asimov's voluminous universe and neither substantially improve nor detract from Seldon's odyssey. I enjoyed the intellectual jawing that permeates all of the Foundation novels, even if Prelude's lesser scope made me nostalgic for the high-stakes, space-traversing amplitude of the earlier works. Whether we ultimately needed an origin story is left for the reader to decide. As for myself, it's the stories that emerge once Seldon's science is already off the ground that keep me coming back for more.", "images": [], "asin": "0553278398", "parent_asin": "0553278398", "user_id": "AFO4BFHMLIZNLUB6VKQF7TIGNGOA", "timestamp": 1489440676000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Did I actually want to spend the money to buy this in hardback? Why not instead read one of the three Bryson books I still had in my &#34;to be read&#34; pile? So I picked up this one. The premise: Bryson, after years of living in England, comes home to the midwest (Iowa) in 1988 and drives around most of the country in a little Chevette (one of which I had once), commenting about the odd and the unusual.<br /><br />Well, there's some of that, some nice descriptions of a couple of national parks, and some nostalgia about family vacation trips when he was a kid.

The funny part is that he travels through the Midwest and the South\u2014badmouthing everyone in the latter as if it were still 1955; he is astonished, apparently, that in 1988, black people and white people actually EAT together in the South!\u2014and can't find the ideal small town, then when he gets into New England and finds some picture-perfect ones, heavens, they're TOO perfect.<br /><br />Okay, I know he's supposed to be commenting wryly on the American scene, and his observations on tourist traps are spot on, but really, after pages and pages of this stuff, can you blame the reader if he or she is the one who wants to kvetch, kvetch, kvetch right back? Along the way he trashes country music, Mexican music, farmers, hillbillies...and heaven forbid that you are female and overweight! It seems every few pages or so he goes into a diatribe about obese women, which is rich considering he describes himself as overweight several times. Plus, as far as I can tell, the only things he liked that he saw were a few scenic spots, Cooperstown, and the Henry Ford Museum/Greenfield Village. He writes off Williamsburg because, you know, some of the buildings are reconstructed; doesn't like that all the treasures of the Smithsonian are now in separate buildings instead of piled higgledy-piggledy in the Castle to discover in a corner; and is sour because most places don't look like the pictures.<br /><br />Unless you like endless jokes about fat women, motor homes, and stereotypical waitresses, borrow this from the library, okay?", "images": [], "asin": "0060920084", "parent_asin": "0060920084", "user_id": "AGNSUP65FG6GKSCQJKEH7A4YZLEQ", "timestamp": 1454534323000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

With a critical and detail eye, wars, religion, race and immigration reflect the events that have occurred in the United States since her founding and parallel the most recent as a result of the election of 2008.  This book is an elaborate historical commentary on American democracy and its present reawakening.  All of the pinnacle events mentioned in the book have played a part in shaping and changing the social, political, and religious landscape of the country and are discussed with the present in mind; there are links to America's ancestral past especially with Schama's examination of Quartermaster General of the Grand Army of the Republic, Montgomery C.

But the book rests highly on politicized commentary that stresses an editorial tone with references of present political actors, which may date the book years from now.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Decent read but it would help to read the entire series 1st", "text": "A Springwater Christmas will no doubt please fans of the &quot;Springwater&quot; series because it appears that every character (and all of their *many* kids) make an appearance here.  I hadn't read the  previous books and found these people to be nothing more than a huge  distraction because they did very little to enhance the love story.  But,  if you're a fan, you may love seeing these people again.<br /> The main story  focuses on Olivia Darling, a grumpy spinster who spent her best years  tending for an ailing aunt  who thanked her by berating her and destroying  her confidence.  Now that the horrid aunt has finally died Olivia is free  to live her life the way she chooses.  Sure that her childbearing years are  well behind her she has given up on her dreams of love and family and has  instead purchased a boarding house in Springwater.<br /> Olivia's first  boarder is Jack McLaughlin, a secretive civil-war survivor looking for a  quiet place to rest.  These two lonely, wounded souls make an immediate  connection but Jack's past haunts him and until he finds peace with himself  he is unable to give his heart to Olivia.<br /> Jack makes this often  predictable book worth reading.  He is simply a wonderful hero who really  leaps off the pages.  If you have a soft spot for wounded heroes you'll  love Jack.  Olivia, on the other hand, wasn't as easy to like.  She takes  the &quot;prickly&quot; heroine to a whole new level and often behaves like  a crabby granny rather than a thirty-two year old woman.<br /> Although I  wish the author had toned down the constant interruptions made by the  secondary characters this was still a better than average romance - all  because of Jack.

{"rating": 3, "title": "This is not a guide book for self-help at home", "text": "This book does not deal with the problem of nerve entrapment due to any other cause but muscle tension. Many well-regarded pain-management professionals believe as much as 80% of the chronic pain conditions in this country are related to dysfunctional muscle tension, for example, Dr. Bernard Filner in Maryland. But those same proponents of this approach to chronic pain will also tell you that it is never a safe choice to assume that muscle tension is the cause, or even a contributing factor, in your particular pelvic pain without first undergoing adequate medical testing to rule out other potential causes. In the case of pelvic pain, nerve entrapment may also be caused by spinal-disc or abdominal-organ injury or disease; it may be caused by abnormal formations of hard-tissue structures entrapping nerves, or it may be due to adhesions, that is, fibrosis or scar tissue which clings to nerves. These types of medical issues will not be relieved by muscle-release techniques such as this book recommends.<br /><br />Sadly, not everyone in this country who has pelvic-floor pain has the material resources, family support, and patience in the face of extreme pain, to undergo the huge amount of medical screening involved to solve the riddle of pelvic pain, whose true origins are often extremely hard for physicians to determine. The initial diagnostic process is extensive, time consuming and, even with an excellent health-insurance policy, the out-of-pocket portion the patient is required to pay can be quite expensive. This screening process can involve some or all of the following: lab tests of the genitourinary system to check for possible infections; ultrasound, abdominal x-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for abnormal body structures or abnormal tissue growth; colonoscopy to check for diverticulitis or other inflammatory bowel disease; laparoscopy (a thin tube attached to a small camera inserted through a small incision in the abdomen) to closely examine abdominal organs to check for abnormal tissue growth or infections in the abdominal cavity; specialized nerve blocks to figure out which nerves in the pelvic region are being compressed. Many patients also undergo surgeries which often are not truly warranted because the surgeon's approach is a classic case of, \"When you only own a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" Surgeons are trained to cut, and each specializes in particular surgeries. If you go to a given surgeon, chances are high they will offer you the surgeries they know how to do, whether or not that particular surgery is what you need. On top of that, all surgeries, even those offered to remove scar tissue, lead to the body creating new scar tissue which can, in and of itself, become a new source of pain.<br /><br />If all of these tests listed above turn out to be normal, and/or the surgeries the patient has been put through by well-meaning doctors are a failure at eliminating pelvic pain--or create additional pelvic pain--then at that point, and out of sheer desperation, many pelvic-pain sufferers come to the idea of muscle tension as a last resort. It is important to know, though, that it is highly doubtful if insurance will cover a trip to Dr. Wise's clinic, and this book is *not* an offer by the doctor of a do-it-yourself, home-treatment program. Instead, it is a sales pitch for Dr. Wise's clinic.<br /><br />The only at-home care that Dr. Wise does offer in book form is in another book he has written, not this one. It is called [[ASIN:0972775587 Paradoxical Relaxation: The Theory and Practice of Dissolving Anxiety by Accepting It]]. Some people may find that book sufficient in and off itself to learn and practice on their own the particular type of relaxation technique that Dr. Wise prefers above all others of the countless relaxation techniques available today.<br /><br />The only other at-home-care opportunity on offer by Dr. Wise are those that he and the physical therapists on his staff train patients to do. These include specific stretches and his recommended method for using a special, rectal/vaginal probe that Dr. Wise invented to release deep, internal, trigger points in pelvic-floor muscles.<br /><br />For those who have gone through substantial testing to discover the cause of their pelvic pain and are mostly, but not 100%, sure that their pain is caused by a \"headache in the pelvis,\" or are simply desperate and looking for something, anything, that might possibly help their excruciating pelvic pain, one possible way to be sure before racing off to Dr. Wise's expensive clinic in California that you are a candidate for his treatment is to test out his main theory for yourself. Dr. Wise asserts that habitual \"tail tucking\" behavior (which happens when someone hangs their head or curls in fetal position when afraid, depressed, or in pain) is the cause of entrenched spasms of the pelvic-floor muscles. It is possible to mentally create a reaction in the body which is the opposite of this behavior by using the technique of [[ASIN:1590307801 visualization]].<br /><br />Visualization is a well-respected technique that has been used for many decades by professional athletes to enhance performance and medical patients to heal illness. Utilizing the image of tail-tucking, one could start out imagining oneself as an unhappy, frightened dog (perhaps one's own beloved pet--when I do this, I imagine my 10-lb rat terrier, Dottie, who frequently engages in tail-tucking behavior). Then, imagine your visualized dog-self becoming happy--your imaginary ears perk straight up, and so does your imaginary tail. Purposely put a smile on your face at the same time. When you do this while standing, you will notice that your head instinctively lifts up and the spine straightens, improving stooped posture, which physical therapists everywhere will inform you is a major contributor to back and neck pain. It is a simple matter to do this free, easy visualization multiple times a day for a few seconds. Not only does this visualization set up a new pattern in the body to counteract any unconscious tail-tucking, but the smile and the happy-dog visualization releases endorphins, which are known to be natural painkillers.<br /><br />Test out this visualization for at least a week. If you notice any amount of improvement in your pelvic pain, it is possible you might be a candidate for further training in methods of releasing your pelvic-floor muscles at the doctor's expensive clinic.<br /><br />I rate this book as follows:<br />Introduction of an interesting spin on pelvic pain with the tail-tucking concept: 4 stars<br />Self-help training for pain control at home: 1 star<br />Overall: 3 stars", "images": [], "asin": "0972775552", "parent_asin": "0972775552", "user_id": "AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A", "timestamp": 1377467910000, "helpful_vote": 59, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Delicate Lovely Prose, Obvious Archetypes", "text": "I believe that nowadays the fairy tale has taken somewhat of a backseat to other genres. It makes sense after all: in a world full of stories about the dead coming back to haunt us (zombies, crime scene investigations, accounts focusing on famous authors and artists rather than the what the authors and artists produced), and in which we know everything already, the fairy tale by comparison can seem startlingly antiquated and slow. Time moves in a linear fashion, and plot advances in tidy bundles. We *know* that true love conquers all, and that the virtuous and brave will succeed in the end, no matter how they falter. We know that we are to heed these tales and trust our instincts. So what else? If we are to read and appreciate fairy tales in this day and age (and we still do despite our changing interests), we must go a step further in our understanding of them in order for them to give meaning to our lives. Whether it's as simple as the blockbuster YA retelling of Cinderella, \"Ella Enchanted\" by Gail Carson Levine, which was successful because Ella was educated, slightly clumsy, and charmingly snarky, or the stunningly sensual and beautiful \"Kissing the Witch\" by Emma Donaghue (mature readers only) which revisits gender roles and female sexuality in traditional tales, the modern retelling or rehashing of the traditional fairy tale is extremely popular.<br /><br /> \"Wildwood Dancing\" is a traditional fairy tale based on two well-known stories: The Twelve Dancing Princesses and The Frog Prince. Set in rustic olden day Romania, The story is about five sisters: one beautiful, one sensible, one scholarly, one flirty, and one little. Every full moon they journey to another world filled with fairies and trolls and magic to enjoy a night of dancing, returning in the wee hours of the morning. All is fine and well until their ailing father leaves them and their sinister, sexist cousin moves in to take over their affairs. His very presence also threatens their chances of journeying into the other world, which takes place in the woods, which he hates. Through the book's events, which go from bad to worse, the ultimate question turns out to be whether or not true love can save the day.<br /><br /> I ended up enjoying Marillier's lovely, elegant story, despite everything. She writes in a slow, carefully wrought, pretty way that suits the fairy tale genre. However, I do think that it lacks a great deal. The main character Jena, who narrates the story, is a strong, sensible, feisty young lady in keeping with traditional fairy tale roles, and she must learn to trust her instincts in order to solve her problems. However, it seemed to me that she understood her own shortcomings and what was happening in the atmosphere around her much too well. When she learns her lessons, she overly explains to us the folly of her previous ways, even though she is self-aware when she commits those follies. Also, one of her shortcomings was being a control freak, which she was, but I never got the feeling that she overcame that, despite her attempts to assure the reader that she did. She had a tight hand in everything right up until the end, and I believe she loved being the center of attention. I wouldn't have minded this (character flaws are always welcome) if I didn't have the nagging suspicion that Marillier desperately wanted to convince the reader that Jena had some sort of breakthrough. I also thought her relationship with her beloved \"pet\" frog was at times mighty cloying, to the point where it became uncomfortable.<br /><br /> But the main problem I had with \"Wildwood Dancing\" goes back to my original point. I don't believe that Marillier ever fully made the tale her own. I was okay that she borrowed from other fairy tales, but there was nothing that spoke \"new\" to me. I could never quite believe in the magic of the other world, perhaps because they didn't spend enough time there, or perhaps there was too *much* magic to contend with. Sisters placidly enjoying the realm of fairies, goblins, vampires, witches, trolls, etc. etc. etc. becomes very un-magical to me if it is not explored. The female characters are all weak when it comes to love (one becomes quite literally on the verge of death) and the ones that need to be \"tamed\" into loving submission do---nothing new for a fairy tale. Still, however, I adored the incorporation of the Romanian landscape and history into the tale. I would suggest that Marillier incorporate even more regional sensibilities into her future works---not only items and landscapes but sensibilities and world views, too. I believe that writing even more about Romania in \"Wildwood Dancing\" would have given Marillier's book the edge to set the book apart from the others.<br /><br /> Though flawed, I would recommend this book to girl who adores fairy tales and romantic love. If nothing else it's sweet, and Marillier's writing is more than formidable.", "images": [], "asin": "0375844740", "parent_asin": "0375844740", "user_id": "AGKNPX3S4L2KQCL5SF4WKBIAQSRQ", "timestamp": 1302478549000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Dated collection of MEDiocre SciFi short stories", "text": "This book is basically an anthology of six novelettes and two novellas, chronicling the interstellar travels of Med Ship Man Calhoun and his alien sidekick Murgatroyd (kind of an intelligent mix between a small dog and a monkey, and who has special immune system traits), using the spaceship Aesclipus Twenty.  These stories originally appeared in various SciFi magazines during the late-50s thru mid-60's.  I somehow managed to get thru all the stories, and following are reviews of each of them:<br /><br />** MED SHIP MAN (Novellete, 1963) - While the technology used by the bad guys is believable, the plot involves too many coincidences.  The pushy businessman character who basically forces his way down to the \"apparently deserted\" planet is way too shallow.  Calhoun obviously doesn't like ANY businessmen, supposedly because of the way the businessmen treated people and animals on the planet Texia.  With the mystery of the deserted planet just beginning, almost immediately Calhoun suspects the businessmen as the bad guy.  Well, the businessman ends up being from Texia, and he is involved with a scheme using cattle herding technology from Texia, to herd people on Maya away from the cities, so he can buy prime real estate dirt cheap.<br /><br />** PLAGUE ON KRYDER II (Novellete, 1964) - The trusting Calhoun bumbles thru and dodges multiple attempts on his life while interfering with a pack of interstellar bandits who take advantage of planets, upon which they have unleashed plagues.<br /><br />** THE MUTANT WEAPON (Novella, 1957) - A story of a biological warfare attack on a newly colonized planet.  This story contains some excellent detailed descriptions of Leinster's Planetary Grid and Interstellar Drive technologies, but also contains a lot of backward technology; for example, reel-to-reel tape drives.  There are some good parts that give a decent picture of the horrors of germ warfare<br /><br />**+ RIBBON IN THE SKY (Novellete, 1957) - A semi-decent story, with more backwards technology (e.g. Calhoun has to manually perform photo comparisons, something a computer has been able to do long ago).  The most interesting parts are related to human biological theories, based on separated human populations; and this even leads to a bit of romance.  This is possibly the best story of the collection (but that isn't saying much).<br /><br />** TALLIEN THREE (Novellete, 1963) - Calhoun & Murgatroyd arrive at planet to do a routine medical survey, and lo and behold, the planet is experiencing a biologically-based revolution, that ends up being masterminded by yet another mad scientist gone bad.  Crummy plot in general, but the nightmarish technology causing the population to be turned into garbage-eating ghouls is unique, to say the least, and future computer technologies are described pretty well, considering this was written in 1963.<br /><br />** QUARANTINE WORLD (Novellete, 1966) - A seemingly pefectly healthy world undergoes a Medical Service inspection - but things are just a bit too perfect.  It turns out that another \"plague\" is being hidden from the rest of the Galaxy, for \"evil business purposes\" (Leinster is definately a socialist, if not a communist, at heart).  Nothing very different about this story than the rest.<br /><br />* THE GRANDFATHERS' WAR (Novellete, 1957) - A colony is forced to evacuate their younger people to another star system, when their star becomes unstable and threatens to go nova.  The overworked younger people become embittered against the older generation and rebel.  Oh, and of course there is great sickness brewing amongst the youngest people on the new colony... this story could have actually been good, given a Twilight Zone-like ending - but it ends up with some highly unlikely rocket heroics by Calhoun, and a sappy kiss-and-makeup ending.<br /><br />** PARIAH PLANET (Novella, 1961) - Calhoun is sent to a sector neglected by the Med Service for far too long, and encounters a planet whose inhabitants are subjected to famine and rascist isolationism by another more well to do planet in a nearby solar system.  This could have been one of the better stories in the book, but the persistant meddling by Calhoun in the two planets' affairs made me think that MED SHIP didn't stand for MEDical SHIP, but really stood for MEDdling SHIP.<br /><br />At the time this review was written, this book was available on the Baen Online Free Library (and if it wasn't, I wouldn't have wanted to pay more than a bargain-shelf book price to read this dated collection of SciFi stories).<br /><br />Murray Leinster was considered one of the pioneers of \"modern\" SciFi writing, and was a longtime mainstay of the genre.  If nothing else, some folks might get a kick out of sampling some of his writing by reading one or two of the stories from this anthology.  He does a pretty good job describing some of his more advanced technologies; for instance the Planetary landing grids, and interstellar travel mechanisms.  However, his older stories didn't even foresee the use of observation satellites or spy planes which were to become common place just a few years after the stories were written (in the book rockets are launched to take photographs).  And, lets face it, the stories are somewhat slow-paced/dull, and the character development does not stand up to what we expect to find in present day SciFi stories.  Oh, and could we have some good-looking women, please?  And finally, these stories have a strong and na\u00efve socialist leaning (in one story all businessmen are seen as evil, and in others economic classes are virtually non-existent).<br /><br />NOTE1: Some folks have complained about the incessant repetition of simple facts... the reason there is so much repetition, is because this is a collection of independent stories that were originally designed to be read separately; so, in each story he has to repeat descriptions of technologies and main character's traits (especially Murgatroyd's).  The net result is that the stories get more and more repetitive and boring as you make your way thru the book.<br /><br />NOTE2: The medical spaceship Aesclipus Twenty is named after the Greek/Roman God of medicine and healing Asclepius/Aesculapius.", "images": [], "asin": "0743435559", "parent_asin": "0743435559", "user_id": "AHME6Y36XVBFNXYSOX6LCAQPUZZQ", "timestamp": 1114011649000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

They can have errors. If you are reading a manual and do not understand something, it is usually you. However, I do find manuals with errors all the time.

If you are going to do a swing set assembly with a manual that is 100+ pages, having a spare copy certainly helps, especially if you do not have to pay for the printing costs.<br /><br />I did not see a discussion of dealing with stripped screws and bolts. It is a skill, and special tools are required. I have learned the hard way, especially when doing dis-assembly jobs; it is best to be prepared for stripped screws and bolts.<br /><br />Also, I did not see a discussion of the use of screw lubricants for lag screws into wood (Screw-Lube, Dishwasher soap, spit, etc.) or Screw tighteners like Loc-Tite and how to bust them.<br /><br />On exercise equipment, I did not see a discussion of placing parts in the freezer for a few hours to get a tiny bit of contraction (we do this with the main axle on ellipticals) to make them fit.<br /><br />I was hoping for but did not see, a graceful way to keep children out of the work zone.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Disappointing", "text": "George DeWolfe is an internationally recognized photographer. He is well known for his workshop on the master print, and I believe this book is based in part on this course. (I have not taken the course.)<br /><br />It's important to realize that this book was written by a photographer with decades of experience in darkroom work. Thus visual evaluation of prints is paramount to obtaining his desired result. So DeWolfe recommends leaving auto settings off, and your eyes and brain to 'see' the print. The workflow he presents uses an approach I have not seen elsewhere, and my initial trials are very pleasing. He suggests that in Adobe Camera Raw, saturation be reduced to -100 to view a B&W version of the image, and adjusting to achieve the best image based on luminance values. Saturation is restored afterward. This makes perfect sense photographically, and it works! With too many Photoshop books being written by Photoshop gurus with little talent in photography, this is a breath of fresh air!<br /><br />What disappoints here is that there are so few examples in the book on evaluating images. This is clearly DeWolfe's strong point and more would have been better. Indeed, he shows a number of \"images from hell\" he uses in his workshops to show case what can be done with his technique, but these are not included with the book, or available on his web site. He also describes a process he calls outlining, but unfortunately there are no explicit details.<br /><br />In general, I would say that the author has assembled a collection of Photoshop techniques he has learned to use very well, and, of course will work for the reader. Many go back several versions in Photoshop, but are no longer current or best practice. For example, he describes a workflow which creates a set of layers for global, local and defect correction, based on a layer copy of the original image. This should lead to non-destructive adjustments, and in fact he recommends saving this layered version in case future adjustments are necessary. However, in one example, he applies separate balancing corrections to the left and right sides of image copy layer directly then saves the file. Neither of these changes can be re-adjusted individually, other than by adding more corrections on top, or deleting the layer copy and start over. It is quite possible to make identical adjustments using the gradient / mode technique on real layers that can be individually changed later.<br /><br />This book promotes the use of a few specific tools, especially Optipix 3.1, to achieve certain outcomes that would usually require tedious and repetitious effort to achieve. I have no problems with this since several additional tools, as well as comparable Photoshop features are also discussed. An Optipix Demo is available for download and evaluation. Such time saver tools are wonderful if they meet your expectations.<br /><br />His discussion of interpolation to larger image sizes is based on comparisons of third part tools with the Photoshop \"bicubic\" interpolation method. But Photoshop CS2 has a new and much better tool for this called \"bicubic smoother\" that improves greatly on bicubic. Thus you might be mislead into using a tool that is less capable than Photoshop. Again, trial versions will be useful before purchase.<br /><br />The author devotes some attention to correcting color casts and white balance in Photoshop, an important and frequently needed adjustment. He totally omits any discussion of the use of gray cards in the establishment of more exact settings. While final white balance and color are always the prerogative of the artist, this seems really strange for an Ansel Adams 'trainee'.<br /><br />Overall, I find the book decidedly under-edited. There are several areas where the reader can become confused. Pages 142 and 143 describe adjustment of overall contrast and brightness for grayscale images. However the resulting image has a distinct color cast vs the original gray. Looks very much like a selenium toned B&W print! Perhaps this is the intent, but it is not described as such. Pages 144 to 147 show a similar adjustment for color (RGB) images, yet the image appearing in the channel clipping displays is not the image being adjusted. Go figure.<br /><br />On page 59, the use of a Wrattan 90 to previsualize contrast is described. This technique is well known. (Ansel Adams has given similar tools to his workshop students.) But the original photograph shown, as we discover later on page 178, is not the original image, but one greatly modified though the suggested workflow. So what is the Wrattan 90 really doing?<br /><br />So, two stars for the fine and unique content provided by DeWolfe on visualization and use of desaturation in the image work flow. Follow his Photoshop technique initially, but read elsewhere for finer control in Photoshop. Let's hope the second edition has more DeWolfe!", "images": [], "asin": "0072260874", "parent_asin": "0072260874", "user_id": "AHQNQDK427R5ZCZOQBRZAWGJWLYQ", "timestamp": 1152024320000, "helpful_vote": 97, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

That's the feeling I got reading this book by Lawrence Block, still one of my favorite crime writers.  But, this may be his worst effort.  It's the tale of a serial killer, a girl in her twenties whose goal is to return to each man she has had sex with and kill them.  No reason given.  It was clear why she killed her parents, because of years of sexual abuse as a child.  But beyond that, she never explains why she is doing it, except that it feels good.  Another major weakness: she never comes close to being caught.  There's no suspense here.  It's just sex, slash, and move on.  The book jacket says this is \"A Novel of Sex and Violence.\"  The violence is hardly anything.  True she kills, but it's quick and done.  The sex is fairly plain until she discovers lesbianism.  This appears to be a book that Block wrote for the publisher Hard Case Crime, whose stock in trade seems to be sex and violence, but little suspense.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Excellent Cartoons with Some Disturbing Tales", "text": "What drew me to this graphic novel was the amazing pictures that had such fantastic details and were so skillfully drawn. Of course, I can also never resist a book on the circus/carnival. At first glance, the crowded and overwhelming number of pictures seemed perfect for the circus atmosphere that often time has multiple acts all running simultaneously. However, I felt that the plot and characters in this graphic novel left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Shadlowland includes ten different stories that are all set in either the circus or a carnival with the characters that are larger than life such as clowns, midgets, bearded ladies, voodoo witches the size of one's thumb and many more true \"characters\". The first story is about a sideshow high diving pig that has past his prime and must watch as he is replaced by a younger pig. Another story is told by the circus owner's wife, who is a midget, and the sketchy dealings that her husband (a clown who is always in makeup) makes in order to keep the circus afloat.<br /><br />Deitch gives the reader an interesting cast of characters and tells each of their stories in vignettes. Still, this was not enough to keep my attention. Some of the story lines turned extremely sexually graphic which deterred me from reading them while others felt as if they had been done before. While the illustrations are what first won me over, I soon found myself overwhelmed by what was going on in the illustrations. The more time I spent hunched over the graphics, the more I forget what the plot was and had to go back to the beginning. Though each page truly embodied the atmosphere of a circus/carnival is also left the reader feeling as if there is not enough time in the world to absorb all of the pictures and their meanings.

There's cloning, time travel, space travel to alternate Earths and of course, lost islands.  Numerous scientific problems are present here. How did the island escape the great cataclysms that nearly wiped out life on earth three times in the past 500 millions years?  Or, if evolution is a general phenomenon, why would it act in such a strange way on this one island?  And how can such a diverse multitude of creatures coexist with all we know about predators and prey and eventual outcomes?<br /><br />The weakest point concerns the arthropods could somehow evolved into an anthropomorphic state, instantly learning and speaking our language.  It's absurd. The historical allusion gets us off to a good start.  That is followed by the reality show and all its quirky happenings. What the book is missing is a central character, a firm base around which the tale can develop.  There are scientist of all stripes - a smart-ass, cynical publicity hound, an unassuming African American, a beautiful woman, etc along with media and political folks.  Not a lot of \"character growth\".  LOL<br /><br />The human-like species that emerge in the end prove the biggest disappointment.

Humorously, we're told that their ability to become invisible has kept them alive right after we read of creatures who attack by smell!

Having mined all of his unfulfilled life into an arguably failed career as a writer, Martin has yet to publish a follow-up book, and now writes magazines articles and ghostwrites semi-fictitious bios for celebrities.  Though he has a girlfriend when the story starts out, Martin nursed an unrequited passion for a classmate in HS - a girl who may have sent a flattering postcard bearing no return address or last name.  Despite his ongoing healthy relationship, Martin takes off for his HS dream and instead finds her younger sister and the wreck of the family the older girl left behind.<br /><br />In \"Bomb Scare\" a young boy and girl are thrown together by the wicked dynamics of high-school.

He should be happy, but why there's something selfish about desires that fixate on young summer blondes (it's a point made by his therapist - Neil has a right to be happy, but he discriminates against women who aren't young or otherwise nubile).  The subject of Neil's unwanted attentions is aware of Neil, but he's not even no. 2 on her pecking order - instead, she really does think he's a creep, and from her vantage point it's easy to see why.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \"Summer Blonde\" feels more incomplete than enigmatic.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not as good as the others", "text": "I read the original Fancy Nancy book to my nieces, and, at the time, thought that the effect of Nancy stopping every other word to explain that \"That's a fancy word for so-and-so\" was a little annoying. Having now read several of the early readers, I can honestly say that it is MUCH less annoying when you're not the one reading the book aloud!<br /><br />My niece (who is six and entering the first grade in a week!) found this book easy enough to read with only a little help from me. Help largely consisted of asking her to sound out a word a second time, asking her if the sentence \"makes sense\" the way she read it, or asking if she's SURE she saw a d (or b, or w) in that word. There were a few words I had to read *for* her, but not more than I'd expect from this style of book. However, it should be noted that she was one of the better readers in her kindergarten class.<br /><br />The \"fancy words\" in this book range from the useful - biography, select - to the more fanciful - crestfallen, plume.<br /><br />I'm a little surprised at how much Nancy's parents enable the \"learning lesson\" at the end. They don't just let her work on the cover to the exclusion of everything else (albeit with a few warning comments that she needs to leave time for the REPORT part of the report), they actively take her to the store to get the supplies for this. (Apparently beads + yarn + fringe = INDIAN.) And Nancy's teacher is also super-understanding - she tells Nancy to just tell them about the book, so far so good, but she doesn't tell her to make up her report that night. That strikes me as a little unrealistic.<br /><br />I'm also concerned with some of the misconceptions shared in this book. Nancy repeats the line about Sacajawea being an \"Indian princess\", which she plainly wasn't. Nobody said that about her until a good 70 years after her death, in fact. As that's just about the only information we get about her in this book (which isn't about Sacajawea, so that's fair), it's a little disappointing that it's wrong.<br /><br />I will also note that there are an awful lot of sentences on each page.

Then there is Constance, a mage who comes back home to Duke\u2019s Forest to help get rid of the toxic storm cloud that has been circling above Duke\u2019s Forest for years.<br /><br />Nothing is what it seems with either women. We follow their journeys and find out if the storm cloud can be defeated at all.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br /><br />*The world building is fascinating with different mage factions. We only get a glimpse of a few of them but I think there is so much potential to learn more about this fantasy world. The people in Duke\u2019s Forest don\u2019t use magic, they worship their Ancestors \u2013 the dead that are buried below their city in crypts. Their way of life is to serve them. Outside of Duke\u2019s Forest is where magic thrives.<br /><br />*Lena interested me more than Constance. Lena is an orphan raised as a cryptling, assisting the city\u2019s mortician. She is without family, raised basically with dead bodies but then things start happening to her, she has power. More power than she ever had in her life.<br /><br />*Emris, a huntsman mage, is Lena\u2019s introduction into life outside of Duke\u2019s Forest. He teaches her about her magic and power. Theirs is a friendship that grows and I was glad Lena had someone.<br /><br />*This story was gory and dark at times! There was dark magic, necromancy and dead bodies coming to life. I thought that was fun, haha, morbid yes but I liked that it went there.<br /><br />Things That Made Me Go Hmm:<br /><br />*I needed MORE from this story \u2013 I felt like there was so much potential with the world building and I didn\u2019t get enough. Also I felt like the characters, or maybe mostly Constance, was superficial. Even her supposed romance with Xander was so quick and strange, I was like\u2026??\u2026am I supposed to feel something about these two? Because I feel\u2026nothing.<br /><br />*I didn\u2019t vibe with Constance but by the end, my feeling about her was right. So maybe there was a reason why something about felt off! There were some parts of this book that felt a bit melodramatic and it was mostly to do with Constance. \ud83e\udd28<br /><br />*The story did drag a bit, especially with this problem of this toxic storm cloud hovering over Duke\u2019s Forest. Like\u2026what is it? Why is it there? Why Duke\u2019s Forest? It ties in all at the end, but it took awhile to get there \u2013 to the point I didn\u2019t know why Constance\u2019s story mattered. It matters\u2026but in the beginning I wanted to skip her parts to read about Lena.<br /><br />*The twist at the end was surprising but, Constance again, to me\u2026ruined it. I just did not like her!<br /><br />*Triggers: death, being around dead bodies<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I enjoyed the world building, Lena and the necromancy in this book but I really needed more. Overall, this book fell short for me in so many areas, but it did keep my interest enough to want to know what was the whole deal with the toxic storm cloud! It was just an okay read for me.", "images": [], "asin": "1408898055", "parent_asin": "1408898055", "user_id": "AFJP3IQINRRY6C4VEGEZGOBHWQQQ", "timestamp": 1583532892964, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "A Thriller That is Bereft of Thrills", "text": "McKenna never knew what happened to her friend Susan Hauptmann, who had disappeared ten years prior.  She is presented a video of a woman rescuing a teen that had fallen on the subway tracks.  McKenna is sure that the woman in the video is Susan.  When she does some investigating, both the video she saw and the actual subway camera videos are unexplainably deleted.<br /><br />McKenna had gotten her life in order after she had been kicked off her position as an assistant district attorney for presented evidence that a cop may have planted a gun on suspect.  She had changed careers and become a successful magazine writer.  Now when she starts probing into Susan again, it seems that there is some tie-in to the incident with the gun planting.

At times it was hard to follow and if I put the book down for any length of time I needed to go back and reread some parts because events and details that I had previously read wouldn't stick in my mind.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Interesting idea, weak characterization, sloppy writing!", "text": "I read a lot of very negative reviews about this book but decided to pick it up anyway. That'll teach me! I have certainly read worse books than \"Starcrossed\" (*cough* Breaking Dawn *cough* ) but this one still does rank pretty high on my \"Wish I hadn't wasted time on this\" list.<br /><br />And, you know, the thing is that the basic idea of the story had potential. I could totally see this becoming an interesting story. Unfortunately, a good idea does not necessarily make a good book. It always depends on what the writer makes of the idea, and while I applaud Ms. Angelini for picking something other than vampires, angels or werewolves for her story, it has to be said that she isn't a great writer (yet).<br /><br />The first roughly 100 or so pages of \"Starcrossed\" were bad. Ridiculously, cringeworthy, eyeroll-inducingly bad. Nothing in those pages made sense, the characters were completely flat and all behaved very immature, and I did at some point wonder whether this book was written by a 12-year-old. And yet I kept reading because it was so bad it was actually entertaining. It was like driving by an accident --- you know you don't want to see it, but you can't stop yourself from looking, either.<br /><br />Anyway, it got better after that. Marginally. See, it seems that after those 100 or so pages Ms. Angelini finally remembered that characterization should actually be part of a book. Any book. So she tried to give her characters more depth --- which worked to a degree. I was able to relate to the characters a little more but they still did remain pretty one-dimensional throughout the entire book.<br /><br />The main protagonist in \"Starcrossed\" is a teenage girl named Helen Hamilton who lives with her father on the beautiful island of Nantucket. She's tall, blonde, and very beautiful.  Over the course of the beginning of the book we find out that Helen has quite a few abilities --- she's super strong and super fast, she has incredible hearing, she can fly, she can generate lightning ... oh, and did I mention that she can't be hurt by *any* weapon??? Really, it was just a *little* too much for my taste.<br /><br />Now with all those abilities you'd think Helen would be one tough, confident, kick-ass girl, but no --- she's actually weak and childish and full of insecurities.I didn't dislike her exactly, but I didn't really like her, either. In fact, half the time I just found her really annoying. She is also very accepting of anything and everything.  Whether it's the fact that she is stronger and faster than everybody she knows, or that she can fly, or that she is one of the Scions --- descendants of the mythological Greek gods --- she always simply accepts everything as reality without so much as the bat of an eyelash. There is barely a moment of disbelief or anything. Unfortunately it's like that for the entire book --- she almost  never questions anything that she is told or that happens to her!<br /><br />Helen is also a very impassive character. For example, when Cassandra tries to kill her because that's what she saw herself doing in one of her visions, all Helen thinks is that if Cassandra foresaw her death then there would be no point in fighting back or resisting anyway. So she does nothing. Really? Seriously? She just sits there while she waits for Cassandra to behead her with a sword? Any normal person would have panicked and run away or fought back ... or at least thought about running or fighting back. But Helen goes for \"sacrificial lamb\" instead.<br /><br />Then there's the male lead character --- Lucas Delos, a gorgeous boy who has just moved to the island with his family. The first time Helen sees Lucas she starts feeling uncontrollable hate, runs towards him and tries to throttle him or something like that. When she meets him again for the next time near his family's home she barrels right into him as soon as she sees him and they start fighting. Again, she never questions the instant hate she feels toward Lucas and the other members of the Delos family, or the \"Why\" behind the fact that she wants to kill him. Somewhere around page 100 or so they suddenly stop hating each other --- no real explanation for this is given by the author. I guess she expects her readers to be like Helen and just --- can you guess? --- accept it ...!<br /><br />Lucas and Helen are supposed to be these tragic starcrossed lovers, but really ... there was nothing in the book that made me think \"Oh yeah, those two are meant to be together ...\". They go from instant hate (at the beginning of the book) to instant attraction (a little later). There is no base or reason for their love, though. You know how some books have really beautiful love stories that make you smile and sigh and basically make your toes curl? This isn't one of them.<br /><br />And, you know, talk about sending mixed signals! After they get over their initial hatred for each other Lucas constantly holds Helen's hand or hugs her, he gives her smoldering glances ... there is one occasion where he lies with her IN HER BED (her under the covers, him on top ... sound familiar?), and he's holding her and kissing her neck ... but basically the moment she tries to touch him he says \"We can't\" ... while still nuzzling her neck, of course. In another situations she tells him that she's mad at him for leading him on (which he did) and then he gets mad at her for saying that ... Hello?<br /><br />Let's move on to Helen's best friend Claire --- her reaction when Helen tells her that she can fly (and do other stuff) is absolutely ridiculous! So we're supposed to believe that Claire has know about all of this for a good 10 years and never mentioned it to anyone -- even Helen herself? That a 7-year-old girl would push her best friend of a roof and try to cut her with a knife simply to prove her theories?<br /><br />The Delos family itself had a few mildly interesting characters but they did remind me a little too much of the Cullen family in \"Twilight\". Halfway through the book I realized that the character I liked best of everyone in this story was actually Lucas' psychotic cousin Hector. Well, he was really only psychotic in the beginning. But really, after a while I noticed that he was really the only one with a good head on his shoulders, the only one whose thoughts went in a reasonable direction.<br /><br />I hate it when YA paranormal romance books automatically get compared to \"Twilight\" but in this case there is really no avoiding it. Did Ms. Angelini get inspired (read: steal) from the \"Twilight\" series? You bet she did. There are too many parallels for it to be otherwise. She merely exchanged vampires and werewolves for Greek mythology and the descendants of Greek Gods.<br />________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Here are some examples of the writing and my thoughts while I was reading the book:<br /><br /> \"One of the terrible side effects of feeling as if she somehow already knew Lucas was that she was starting to idealize him, making him more perfect than was humanly possible.\" ... followed by ... \"Which was uncomfortable  because she also still wanted to kill him.\"<br />--- Why does she feel like she already knows him? And why does she want to kill him? She has only seem him twice and hasn't even talked to him yet!<br /><br />\"You just helped me, and I'm grateful. But I still really, really want to kill you.\" ... and then he says \"This is hard for me, too, you know\"<br />--- No, why should she know? They don't know each other at all, after all ...!<br /><br />\"Lucas was like her. The thought made her stomach heave. How could she be anything like someone she hated so desperately?\"<br />--- Ah, right. And how does she know she's like him again? For that matter, how does she know what he's like anyway?<br /><br />Imagine Lucas saying this *right* after he and Helen had been fighting to the death: \"Damn it. They can't find you here or you're dead. Go!\"<br />--- Wait, a moment ago he wanted to kill her, and now he wants her to run away so she *doesn't* get killed? Make up your mind, already ...<br /><br />\"The furies wanted her to kill Lucas, that was clear ...\"<br />--- Really? Why is that clear? And why isn't she the least bit bothered by the thought of killing someone she doesn't even know?<br /><br />\"Helen had no doubt he (Lucas) wanted to kill her ...\" and a little later \"An ancient, supernatural force ewas compelling her to kill Lucas.\"<br />--- And yet she never even asks herself why ... personally, I would have demanded quite a few answers from someone at some point ...<br /><br />\"If paper could cut her but a spear couldn't, could you make a spear out of paper and kill her?\"<br />--- Need I comment this one? A spear made out of paper ... right ...<br /><br />This coming from Helen after hovering in front of her best friend's bedroom window and thus \"coming out\" to her with her new ability: \"I just flew in your window. Why aren't you more surprised?\" ... followed by Claire saying \"I've known you could fly since we were kids. I even pushed you off your roof once to make sure.\"<br />--- Really? I don't even know what to say to that one ...<br />__________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Basically, I quickly lost track of how often I raised my eyebrows and asked myself \"But WHY???\" --- it happened a few times on every page!

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not for me", "text": "I gave Unsub three 1/2 stars and this one will be getting three minus the 1/2 and I will be stopping with the series right here. It\u2019s just not one for me. Everyone else seems to love it so I think it\u2019s a case of personal taste.<br /><br />This is book #2 in the Unsub series and follows FBI profiler Caitlin Hendrix as she tracks down a serial killer inspired by true life murderer Ted Bundy.  I\u2019ve come to realize recently that I\u2019m not a huge fan of police procedural type books unless the serial killer is given his/her own POV like the most excellent The Fourth Monkey by J.D. Barker. I love getting into their heads and seeing what makes them tick. I think I\u2019m spoiled for all serial killer books now that I\u2019ve read that one. This is my problem and not the fault of this book. This story was told mostly from Caitlin\u2019s POV and while she\u2019s a determined, single-minded, strong woman, she wasn\u2019t the killer and when the killer was caught halfway through the story (are you kidding me?!), my attention began to wane pretty quickly and it just devolved into something that I didn\u2019t like.

The grammar and editing reminded me of various self-published novels I've slogged through, and the story itself was formulaic and uninspired.<br /><br />Rather than focusing on subplots or character development, Delaney chose to preach to the children this book will be inflicted upon:  \"But we wanted Harry Potter, like the other children at school!\"<br />\"The other children are heathens who will burn in the pit for eternity, but here's a nice Christian alternative to those horrid books that entice youngsters into practicing witchcraft . . . look, only the bad people use magic, and the Godly heroes beat them with chains and keep them in a watery pit lined with salt where they're poked with pointy sticks to atone for their sins . . . just like Baby Jeezus wouldve wanted.\"<br />\"But I want to read about Hogwarts!  And Quiddich!\"<br />\"Looks like I need to beat the Devil outta you once again . . . go fetch me that belt.\"<br /><br />Very dogmatic tone.  The few times that Tom Ward is enticed into using magic for the greater good he is condemned by his mentor for \"doing evil\", even though nothing negative was done.  His other tutor is possessed by (and I quote) \"the Demon Drink\", and drinks to excess to teach young'uns lessons about the evils of wine.  Almost every female character in the book is either a witch or witchlike (EVIL) and the menfolk are hardworking, honest, and heroic -- with the exception of the \"press gang\" who represent the evil guvmint.<br /><br />The only two likable characters in this tedious lecture on \"morality\" were the \"evil\" Alice and the witch Grimalkin.  Everyone else seemed overly pious and judgemental, and the protagonist (no doubt representative of the impressionable reader) was ineffectual and easily misled.<br /><br />I've read childrens' and young adults' books before, but rarely one that I've had nothing positive to say about.

Clare, the middle girl, has always been different from the others, impetuous and combative, struggling with alcoholism in her adult life. Anna, the youngest girl is seen by the others as the 'princess', spoiled and the favorite. Then along comes Sebastian, and his relationship with his sisters is more as 'mothers' than 'siblings' because of the age difference. When Mom is on her deathbed, she calls Anna to her and tells her where her Will is. She tells Anna there is a letter with the will - and Anna is to find them and burn them both! So Mom dies and the family believes she left no Will. There are not jealousies or arguments among the kids over the estate, so Anna thinks all is fine. But, rather than burning the documents, she decides to read them. That's when she discovers her Mom's deep secret, and the possibility that Clare is the result of a brief affair. She tries to keep all this quiet, but secrets don't stay hidden. The rest of the book revolves around the sibling relationships, blow-ups and reconciliations.

The rest? Well, they are snippets of longer -- sometimes much, much longer works. Yes, they do give an overview of different aspects of Paris, although they seem to have been selected more carefully for their ability to span a wide range of literary styles and eras (authors range from Rabelais to James Baldwin; from Colette to Patrick Modiano; from classics like Balzac or Zola to the little- or less-known figures of Queneau and Perec.)<br /><br />Frankly, a lot is lost when you chop a piece of text out of a long novel and present it to the reader without its context, as an example of writing about Paris. Sure, it's about Paris, but you miss the other part of the equation: where the story stands on its own two legs as a great or good (or perhaps less impressive) literary work. I think you can get away with doing that a few times, but when it's two-thirds of an anthology??? Nope. Not when the theme is Paris, and when so many great stories have been written about/set there.<br /><br />What is here is good, admittedly (the butchery of longer works notwithstanding). You can't quibble with an excerpt from Hugo's &#34;Les Mis&eacute;rables&#34;, for instance. But what is missing also grated on me. Where, for instance, is anything by Marcel Proust? How, in the name of all that is great and good about writing about Paris, could one publish an anthology (especially one with so many excerpts from long works) and exclude his descriptions of the Bois de Boulogne, or the streets of Paris, or... well, any number of scenes in &#34;Remembrance of Things Past&#34; or however you want to translate the title of his epic work. And yet the editor has included an excerpt from &#34;Quartet&#34; by Jean Rhys. I confess I'm bemused. Where is a short story by Mavis Gallant, who lived and wrote about Paris for decades and whose wonderful short stories were published in the New Yorker? She'd be just as interesting -- in a different way -- as Julio Cortazar.<br /><br />If what you're looking for is just a series of snippets of longer works with a Parisian theme, well, these are high-quality snippets, if not always the most representative or the best on offer.

Staged Fright is a suspense thriller about bioterrorism, with a splash of CSI and some quirkiness sprinkled in. All these parts combine to create a funny, entertaining read.<br /><br />As much of a serious topic as terrorism (biological or otherwise), considering the current climate, Ketkar manages to infuse some humor, wit and a little extra that you wouldn't find in other books with the same storyline. The story has a dramatic \"race against time\" vibe, but it stands apart with the variable cast of characters that are involved. They are the ones that add the fun in this book. The Callahan clan is not your typical affluent family. Larkin and Tigh are not your prototypical scientists (which you can say the same about their colleagues at the C.D.C). What I find interesting is that amongst the non-typical people in the book, Neil turns out to be most relatable character there is with his feelings of inadequacy and being an outcast (among his school and family). And I know Jack is a musical prodigy, but it was hard for me to take him seriously with him in his \"prison garb\" and acting thuggish.<br /><br />I appreciated the detail involved in explaining the science behind identifying biological elements and such. You can tell much time and work (whether through personal knowledge or research) was put into the explanation. However, it got to be a little much for me. It took me out of the flow of the story and made it a little hard for me to get through those passages. Maybe if it was a little more condensed, it may not have slowed down the story and kept my interest. But I do appreciate the detailed narration of those scenes.<br /><br />In the end, Staged Fright was a humorous, quirky, suspense thriller that made for a great read.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The New Phase in Zombie/Apocalypse Lit", "text": "What drew me to this one was that this is a story of what happens after Zoe, Louis, Francis, and Bill get picked up by the helicopter and carried off to safety. After World War Z is over. It answers the eternal question of \"what happens next\".<br /><br />What happens next is a lot of medical paranoia. But rightly so, as a single zombie can infect a building full of people faster than you can say \"George Romero\". People live in tight-knitted communities, and can only enter buildings by continuous infection checks (virus-scanners, retina scans, cognitive tests).<br /><br />The other part of the story is about journalism. And not just any journalism -- blog journalism. See, when the zombies broke, the mass media dropped the ball because zombies are kid stuff. Meanwhile the Internet takes this s*** seriously, since most of them have zombie contingency plans, and rose up as legit because they didn't have any big business telling them what to report. A brother-sister news team goes out to follow a candidate's run for president. Along the way, they uncover a bad news bears conspiracy to assassinate said presidential hopeful, using biological weapons (guess which ones) that have some pretty horrible consequences.<br /><br />This a pretty good book, maybe the second best I read these two months. But my biggest problem with it was that there weren't enough zombies. The zombies only showed up during sporadic action sequences. I was expecting more of a David Wellington style book where zombies take a front-and-center. Whereas in this book, they act as a macguffin for \"medical horror epidemic\". This is the first in a trilogy, but I can't really see myself finishing the series. I feel that all the story I wanted to know was told in this one.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Strong start, gets weaker until a ridiculous ending", "text": "1) this book really should be sold and cataloged in libraries as juvenile fiction.  Not just because the main characters are two high school girls, but just for the subject matter, the writing itself, etc.  This is not a story for adults!<br />2) it started out well, and kept my interest.  I was actually taken back to high school (in the early 70s) and my friendship with one girl.  We were also inseparable, like these two.  And like the father said, we got older, life happened and I have no idea where she went.  Then of course, the story changed.<br /><br />Would a teen really keep that sort of secret from her lawyer father, a father she is very close to?  I don't think so.  Would she really hide the \"evidence\" like she did?  I doubt it. That's where the story starts getting into \"bad fiction\" territory.<br /><br />Now, the ending...  this is a SPOILER...<br /><br />While Zipporah and her brother are out on the front porch, their parents decide (without a word to the brother, without asking him what he wants) they will raise their grandchild.  That mom will quit her job to do so.<br />This is what got me, dad saying to the son, \"What are you going to do about it?  Stop going to college?  Get a job to pay for diapers and bottles?\"  YES&lt; THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN!  If this young man wants his baby, he is the one responsible, not his parents.  They didn't even ask him if he wanted the baby, and there was no indication he did, in fact there was no way to tell how he felt, other than embarrassed at being caught. He was in college, Karen was 15.  Did anyone even consider the girl's mother would press charges and he would be in jail, not in college?<br />Instead of any \"learn your lesson here children,\" we get a girl who gets off free after misleading the police (oh, she bemoans her parents lack of trust, but I mean legally), a college student who gets a 15 year old girl pregnant, and his parents make it all okay for him.<br /><br />Not an ounce of responsibility shown in this book in any way.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Studio 54:  the Roman Empire of NYC Nightlife", "text": "New York City and the 1970s:  a dysfunctional marriage that spawned a myriad of cultural icons; one of them being Studio 54.  With THE LAST PARTY, Anthony Haden-Guest details the \"perfect storm\" scenario that allowed Studio 54 to become the patriarch of the city's competitive social scene until it imploded ... a victim of owner self-indulgence and arrogance.  While the book's intention is to highlight the zeal of the nightclub scene in NYC from the disco era through the 80s, it is obvious that Studio 54 set the tone from the beginning and cast a shadow that loomed large, long after its demise.<br /><br />Hayden-Guest's journalistic perspective of New York's night life pays homage to the ingredients that made the magic:  the investors/owners/promoters that facilitated the venues, the celebrity culture that used these venues as their personal playgrounds and the wannabes that simply wanted a taste of the upscale life.  A roughly chronological journey that takes readers through the short-lived life-cycle of Studio 54 and many other clubs that dominated New York's nightlife, the book clearly defines a by-gone era.  Although numerous other clubs are detailed, none have the substantive clout that defined Studio 54 at its peak or the example it set when its owners were imprisoned for tax evasion.  Because of this, Studio 54 dominates the pages of the book.<br /><br />While I was expecting somewhat of a detailed historical overview of Studio 54 and its societal impact, I found the book more of a wistful remembrance of someone who experienced those days first-hand.  As a columnist/critic, Hayden-Guest had a front-row seat to the social scene back then and rubbed elbows with New York's social royalty (including the club owners).  THE LAST PARTY encapsulates the recollection of experiences from those who shared the rise and fall of Studio 54 and the club scene through the 70s and 80s.  Their voices, while offering veracity to the storyline, tend to merge and disrupt the book's reading flow.  But through it all, we get a fly-on-the-wall perspective that details the decadence of an era where fun was a nothing more careless behavior (drugs and sex) in a seedy environment.  There is plenty of celebrity coursing through the book as Studio 54 (and some of the lesser clubs) served as THE watering-hole for the day's social elite (Warhol, Halston, Grace Jones, Bianca/Mick Jagger and a myriad of designers, artists, models and musicians).  The book was written in the 90s, so many of the stories likely won't carry the shock value they surely had almost 20 years ago.  Still, it represents an interesting look at what was considered \"cutting-edge\" back in the 70s and 80s, when hardcore drug-use, sexual proclivities and AIDS were not \"mainstream\" issues.<br /><br />While I found THE LAST PARTY interesting, it never gave me that nostalgic kick that I expected ... in other words, I don't feel I missed-out on anything special by not experiencing Studio 54.  But I did enjoy the book's manner of peeking under the veil that covered the lurid, murky world of greed, violence, lust, intoxication and inhibition that defined New York nightlife back then.", "images": [], "asin": "0061723746", "parent_asin": "0061723746", "user_id": "AGNLRIXUGGGR4E47KQDGWOG6ZGMQ", "timestamp": 1365523661000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Story spanning 60 years of family secrets, privilege, and a murder in South Carolina town", "text": "This work of historical fiction takes place in South Carolina during a sixty-year period (encompassing the 1920s through 1980s). Without warning, the time period weaves back and forth as the story unfolds. At the book's beginning, Judith and Olva are relaxing in their sunroom, enjoying the warmth. There is a sense of old age, and a kind of quiet, loving relationship between these two elderly woman. They share a long history together. Olva is thoughtful, speaks carefully, and is always offering to do things for Judith. It slowly becomes a revelation that Olva is a woman of color. A newspaper report that Judith Kratt's only brother Quincy was murdered at the age of 14 in 1929 is the first piece of information thrust at the reader. The book will take you on a journey from the past to the present to slowly unravel the mystery of who killed Quincy, and also to uncover family secrets.<br /><br />But as the book begins, Judith has decided that she wants to make an accounting of various valuables owned by the Kratt family. As each chapter ends, items are diligently listed that Judith has spoken about during those pages. When you get to the final chapter, the list will be long and complete. Judith's family home is very important to her, and these family heirlooms are treasures with stories to tell.<br /><br />Daddy Kratt ran a successful cotton gin business and eventually opened the Kratt Mercantile Company, a glittering, imposing multi-floored store that even had elevators. Judith was trusted to take inventory and on opening day she took endless store visitors on tours of the facility. However, Daddy Kratt was a ruthless businessman and an abusive, cold-hearted father. Son Quincy, all of 14 years old, would gather information on various people in the (fictional) town of Bound, South Carolina to use against them in order to curry favor with his father. These would serve to improve the Kratt family's business interests by blackmailing enemies. In 1989 we know that the store did not survive, so that is another story to tell.<br /><br />The book centers heavily on issues of race relations, the depressed state of a once thriving town, a disfunctional family, and closely held family secrets. The character of the murdered boy Quincy was so despicable that I was devoid of any sympathy, or even in much interest as to who killed him. Ditto for the father Daddy Kratt. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. The core relationship that appealed to me most was that of Judith and Olva, and the saving grace of these characters carried my middling interest to the book's conclusion.<br /><br />Thank you to the publisher SOURCEBOOKS Landmark for providing an advance reader copy via NetGalley.", "images": [], "asin": "1492678864", "parent_asin": "1492678864", "user_id": "AH2HZDRA725DTBJUOEL3LZTQ7SPQ", "timestamp": 1563076163709, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Kloos apparently hated it though, because he changed everything about it for the second installment.<br /><br />Did you like the protagonist and his upbeat attitude? That's gone. Did you like his girlfriend? She's in about 5 pages this time around. Did you like the job he was doing in the navy? He changed jobs. Did you like him fighting aliens? He only does that for about 5% of this new book. Did you like him fighting the Chinese and Russians? He only does that for about 10 pages this go around. Did you like his infrequent complaints about the inefficiency of the US government and the inequality present in society? What about the stupidity of his commanding officers? If you answered &#34;yes&#34; to those last two, well you're in luck because that's 95% of the content of Lines of Departure.<br /><br />Every single chapter, the protagonist complains about the military. Every single chapter, he complains about the government. He mentions, not once, not twice, but multiple times that he no longer believes in God and thinks the entire human race should be destroyed. Every single officer above the rank of 2nd lt is described as amoral and actively trying to hurt the soldiers under their command, for no reason. Every single politician in the USA is also actively evil for no reason. Every single poor person is mindlessly violent, again for no reason.<br /><br />As you might imagine, this gets a little repetative. It becomes even more so when the author gives us huge chunks of exposition more than once, as if he were combining parts of different drafts without excising the duplicate material. Also the author has a terminal lack of adjectives in his arsenal, and is forced to use the exact same ones for the same things over and over and over again. The armor and accompanying gear of a soldier is apparently called &#34;battle rattle&#34;.

Its ridiculous, no attempt to substitute &#34;armor&#34; or &#34;gear&#34; or anything like that, just the same term over and over.<br /><br />Throw in a deus ex ending that makes very little sense and a pointless cliffhanger and I'm just bored to death with it.

And that woman didn't say a word; another woman would have told her off for talking to her like that!<br /><br />Everytime Ty spoke to Annie, she had a nasty answer!

Not that I had read this book before, but there was something familiar about it.  The book Devious by Lisa Jackson came to mind.  Maybe it was because they both involved assaults on nuns, but I do not know.<br /><br />The book series Rizzoli and Isles bears little resemblance to the television series, so you will have to separate one from the other.  The characters names are the same, but their lifestyles are different.  At least in the first couple of books, I have no idea if Tess Gerritsen will begin to meld the two in future installments.<br /><br />What begins with the assault on two nuns leaving one dead and one barely alive quickly devolves into corporate cover-up when a third woman ends up on Maura's autopsy table missing her face, hands and feet.<br /><br />What could leprosy have to do with the nuns in a cloistered convent and why is Maura's ex-husband suddenly back in her life.<br /><br />This twist makes up the prominent storyline in The Sinner.<br /><br />I did like this book even if it was overly familiar.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Mixed feelings", "text": "I really wanted to like this deck because I love winter and Yule, but I'm a little disappointed so far. The deck excels in presenting many aspects of yule. Where it falls short is the interpretation, both in the guidebook and visually. The poems are really disappointing -- just hard to read and uses incorrect English. The interpretation of some cards feel too similar. Might take time to find if that's good or bad, but it can be frustrating. The deck is overall a bit dark and heavy as well. I get more messages about pushing through and enduring the dark, harsh winter than about the beauty of the season, the holiday spirits or hopeful messages. (I haven't actually counted though.)<br /><br />The artwork and interpretations sometimes don't connect well. For example, the Family card speaks about traditions, but it doesn't come across in the card, which is an artwork of a couple and a baby out in the snow with a forest behind them. The same minimalist background and environment is also used for many cards, not giving a lot of clue to the card meaning.<br /><br />I wish the artwork was more dynamic and diverse, because some compositions look really similar. (See Ceremony, Remembering, and Gratitude). Some are done intentionally though, for example Crone and Father Christmas are simply close-up portraits, and the message is more about a figure or a character. Ethnic diversity is another thing, and as an Asian, I don't feel particularly included.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The first of a series", "text": "Fiona Griffiths, known as Fi, is a young woman in a Wales police department, a detective with good intuition and analytical skills. She is also harboring a dark past, which periodically clouds her sleep, emotional clarity, and her thoughts. Told in the first person, she states that her social skills are a bit off (but I don't see that, only that she tells us), and that she struggles mightily with a challenging mental illness, which is revealed in gradual doses.<br /><br />Fi is currently investigation a case involving the heinous murder of a woman and her young daughter. The bodies were found in a dicey part of town, where they were living, but the mother possessed a credit card of a wealthy businessman who died in a plane crash. Thrown in the mix are prostitutes, a dirty cop, and other typical tropes from the world of crime/police procedurals. Fi is also grappling with reaching out to others, opening up to new friendships and romance.<br /><br />As a crime thriller, this didn't keep me interested. The events were too expository, and only occurred through Fi's second-hand communication, but I didn't feel inside of the action, and, to be honest, the action that did happen was derivative of hundreds of other police thrillers. The events were banal, and had a shopworn feel to it. The pace also crawled. I never felt one compelling moment in the book. Moreover, Fi's predilection for talking to the dead, rather than stir my interest, came off as rather flat.<br /><br />What did keep me reading was Fi's voice, which was warm and intimate and sounded as if it were in the room with me. She enticed me at intervals to continue reading, if for no other reason than to learn more about her emotional history and breakdown. What I didn't believe was how she got a job in the police department as a detective! Perhaps Wales is more lax than the US, where psychological testing is mandatory for all incoming officers to the police academy.<br /><br />This is the first book in a series that will feature Fi Griffiths as the main character. Although the writing was competent and serviceable, and Fi is quite comely and, even arresting at times, I am not persuaded to continue on with the series.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not her best Scarpetta effort", "text": "Loyal Patricia Cornwell readers will perhaps be somewhat disappointed in Black Notice, the 10th release in the Kay Scarpetta series, but will nevertheless purchase a copy and savor each page as if reading the last words of a great world leader. In other words, Cornwell is such a superior writer it is doubtful she could produce a bad read and, indeed, she hasn't yet.<br />Scarpetta is a bit more fragile here than we've seen her in the past, dealing with the death of her lover, Benton Wesley, a year after the fact. It seems she has lost touch with what is going on around her, and must now begin to regain control of her surroundings and her life. Faced with problems within her office, political powers that seek to end her career, and, of course, a killer on the loose, she is forced to come to terms with the past and move forward. This includes reliving much of her relationship with Benton, accepting that he is not still alive and living out some elaborate plan concocted by the FBI for whatever reason, and finding passion in the arms of a living male counterpart abroad.<br />Enter disappointment. The patience of Cornwell's lesbian followers are wearing thin with Benton Wesley. While Cornwell obviously agrees it is time to either put him to rest or bring him back to life, this should have been done some time ago, freeing Black Notice to be the book it could have been. In recovery, Scarpetta engages in sexual activity with a virtual stranger, which seems forced and out of character for our favorite heroine. Maybe we're just jealous, but Talley's introduction seems sudden and intrusive.<br />Lucy, Scarpetta's openly lesbian niece, plays only a small role in the novel, which adds to further disappointment. Surely lesbian readers would have to admit they secretly hope Lucy will be the main focus, or at least a larger one, in upcoming Scarpetta tales. In this book Lucy is still dealing with the monsters that drive her to emotionally dangerous places, while readers wait to see the monsters for what they are, and how she might prevail and overcome her self destructive tendencies. Maybe in the next book.<br />Marino is strong in this installment, as Cornwell brings his unique personality to the forefront and lets the friendship he shares with Scarpetta express itself with humor and an obvious deep caring for one another. Readers have watched Marino's life change over the years, and now he must deal with aging and his shifting importance in the world of law enforcement.<br />The plot of Black Notice lacks the believability of earlier Cornwell novels. Gone are the strong, realistic killers of the early days, having been replaced with dramatic, almost super human qualities. Cornwell seems to be steering clear of the more forensically technical aspects of Scarpetta's work, and does not share as many interesting, if somewhat gory, details that once provided readers with clues and insight into the mind of the killer. The characters' lives and personal quandaries surpass anything the killer may or may not do in this book.<br />With a writing style that is clearly Cornwell, and a cast of characters we have known too long to turn our backs on, Black Notice is a continuation of the Scarpetta saga, and one that is well worth suffering a few disappointments. After all, Cornwell would be hard-pressed to outdo herself, with Potter's Field and Point of Origin tough acts to follow. While perhaps not her best, Black Notice is still worth curling up with on a dark, rainy night.<br />Sherry Stinson...", "images": [], "asin": "0425175405", "parent_asin": "0425175405", "user_id": "AFIW2TRI74VKVYMAGRWB2MBUNLPQ", "timestamp": 1011576125000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Above Average 80's Romance Novel", "text": "This review is of \u201cForbidden Fires\u201d by Bobbi Smith.<br /><br />The book begins just after the end of the Civil War. On a steamboat sailing out of Tennessee are a group of Union soldiers, among them Jericho \u201cCoop\u201d Cooper and his long-time friend, Price Richardson, the hero of the book. They are on their way back home to Illinois and their shipping business. Tragedy strikes, however, when the ship they are on blows up, killing many and seriously injuring both men.<br /><br />Price is rescued from a tree by Lawrence Douglass and his granddaughter, Ellyn, the heroine of the book. Ellyn and Lawrence live at a formerly prosperous, now dilapidated, plantation, Riverwood, with Ellyn\u2019s mother, Constance, and Ellyn\u2019s younger sister, Charlotte. (Ellyn\u2019s father, Thomas, and brother, Tommy, both fought for the Confederacy and were killed during the war).<br /><br />When Ellyn tries to bring Price back to the main house to care for him, Constance refuses to let him in due to her venal hatred of Northerners. (What Constance REALLY hates is the loss of her cushy Southern lifestyle). Ellyn takes Price to a shack on the property to nurse him back to health, and in the process, they fall in love.<br /><br />When Constance finds out about Ellyn and Price, she tries to break them up. She succeeds, for a while. Later, Ellyn discovers she is pregnant with Price\u2019s baby and her \u201cfiance\u201d, Rod Clarke, returns from the war. (Ellyn and Rod were \u201caffianced\u201d as children, as the Douglass and Clarke plantations border each other. Ellyn no longer loves Rod-it\u2019s not sure she ever actually did-and refuses to marry him, as she\u2019s in love with Price). Rod later marries Constance instead.<br /><br />Price returns to Illinois, and finds out two things. One, Coop is alive and well, and two, his aunt, Rachel Kent, and her son, Price\u2019s cousin, Alex, have been living high on Price\u2019s money, thinking that he died in the war. What Price doesn\u2019t know is that Rachel and Alex-along with Price\u2019s ex-mistress, Mary Ann Montague-are partners in a conspiracy to kill him and take his money. The cabal decides to step up their efforts when they discover that Price is planning to marry Ellyn, who has left Tennessee to marry him.<br /><br />Two attempts are made to kill Price; neither succeed, but they do bring pain and heartache to both Ellyn and Price.<br /><br />Eventually, Price discovers the conspiracy and puts and end to it, and he and Ellyn marry and have their Happily Ever After.<br /><br />Upside: Ellyn and Price are fairly interesting, developed characters. Their love for each other is definitely sincere.<br /><br />I also appreciate a very underrated part of Mrs. Smith\u2019s writing: she lets readers know the motivations of her supporting characters and lets them speak in their own voices. More than a few authors don\u2019t do this, so I appreciate Mrs. Smith\u2019s allowing this to happen.<br /><br />Downside: I find that many of Mrs. Smith\u2019s books are stronger in the first half than in the second; this is the case with \u201cForbidden Fires\u201d. When the scene shifts from Tennessee to Illinois, the book becomes less interesting. This, in my view, is because Rachel, Alex and Mary Anne aren\u2019t as good foils for Ellyn and Price as Constance-and later Rod-were. I also didn\u2019t like the way Price foiled the conspiracy against him; the result was highly unsatisfying to me.<br /><br />Sex: Quite a few love scenes here, ranging from suggestive to very mildly erotic.<br /><br />Violence: As mentioned, the ship Price and Coop is on blows up. During an argument, Rod assaults Ellyn. Price is injured during a fire at his shipping business, and later, both he and Ellyn are shot. None of the injuries are life-threatening.<br /><br />Bottom Line: \u201cForbidden Fires\u201d has some elements of a 5 star book, but too many drawbacks for a rating of more than 3.5 stars.", "images": [], "asin": "0821712950", "parent_asin": "0821712950", "user_id": "AF57ERGRF5IBJURVL5SOCCEVU7IQ", "timestamp": 1533665116137, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "\"It'd been too long since he'd tasted human blood.\"", "text": "\"The Hunt\" is the second novel in Zoe Daniels' 'Year Of The Cat' trilogy involving Holly Callison's battle with her nature and her circumstances.  Warning though, you should not read this book before reading the first book in this series, however.<br /><br /> \"\"The Hunt\" starts out several months after the first book, Holly has now been totally isolated from her old friends, and is now trapped in a friendless clique with Alex Sarandon, his sister (Liala), and his four other companions.  Alex has also become even more possessive with Holly, stalking, manipulating, isolating, and attempting to control all of her movements and emotions.  And this continues to escalate during the first part of this novel, and he does all this while telling her that he loves and needs her.  Alex's controlling nature will become so bad that Holly will start lying for him, all while Alex feels the insecure need to CONSTANTLY remind Holly that she is his, and only his.<br /><br /> Unfortunately for both Alex and Holly, there are cracks appearing in their relationship.  Holly is lonely, Alex's clique really doesn't like her, and Alex, despite being tall, dark, and handsome, with charisma to kill for, and who is tops in everything that he strives for or to do, really treats Holly like a second-class person.  Alex continues on his path to being as big as an arrogant, manipulative creep as he can be, and on his birthday he shows his real side to Holly.<br /><br /> Holly was already beginning to draw away from Alex's jealous manipulations, but what happens on Alex's birthday really breaks the relationship, and from here on this novel becomes an anti-love affair between the two.  Although, if you had been catching the hints Daniels had been laying down since the first novel, that's what this relationship had always been.<br /><br /> Then the homicidal Alex decides that Holly has to cement their relationship with a bloody murder, and it's then that Holly realizes what a monster Alex really is.  Alex doesn't take what he considers betrayal well.  The whole point, made in the first novel, and which Alex pounds into Holly constantly, of his stalking and manipulations, is not just because he \"loves\" her, it is because he is in quest of \"The Amulet', a magical object that will grant him great power.  He needs the power of \"the seven\" to find it, and Holly is that seventh, and by hook or by crook he WILL get her to help him or else.  And so the manipulation, the abuse, the threats, and the murders and the attempted murders escalate.  This, unfortunately for the egotistical and spoiled Alex, only makes Holly even more determined to separate herself from him and his gang. Alex is however your typical spoiled rich kid who is clueless and uncaring, and who is going to get what he wants in the end in anyway he can.<br /><br /> One of my problems is that I just don't like bullies, and Alex is just your typical bully with too much money and too much power.  On the other hand, Holly's love, disillusionment, and eventual battle for her own independence is a positive growth in her development as a character; and it hurts every time the abusive Alex pulls some trick on her.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the complaints that I had about the characters in the first novel are still valid.  Most of the characters, including all of Alex's clique, are basically bland furniture; set pieces to move about as the author sees fit to just keep the plot moving.  On the other hand, Tishia Nakao, Holly's first and best friend, becomes more dimensional this time around.  Still, the rest are just shallow at best, and forgettable at worst.<br /><br /> This is a series that would have benefited from a multi-perspective viewpoint, and Daniels tries doing this by having us see somethings through Alex's eyes.  But, still, I would have loved to have seen some of this novel through Tishia's, or even Laila's viewpoint, as Daniels wastes a good opportunity by not developing \u00fcber-b**** Laila any more than she did.  And again, cats gather in PRIDES, not PACKS!<br /><br /> What didn't really work for me was the whole shapeshifter angle.  I just didn't buy into the idea that when somebody shifts into their were-panther mode they were able to shift their clothing; buttons, zippers, money in their pockets, shoes, etc. with them.  Sorry, this was just lame.  I also didn't buy that none of these high school kids had no bad habits.  They didn't drink, smoke, take drugs, swear, have sex, steal, etc.  I mean, the bad kids lie and murder, but, nobody else has any of these other bad habits, nor do they have any good habits, or interests, either.  They are stereotypically, blandly, EVIL.<br /><br /> Then there is that Holly is horrified by the hunting of a deer, but then finds it hard to justify her position on her attitude towards this.  The reasons that she gives make little sense, that is, unless you go back to the first novel where Holly had declared herself a vegetarian, something even the author of this novel seems to have forgotten.<br /><br /> In the end though, this series for young readers, in an age where young adult novels have become more gritty and more rooted in reality, is pretty generic that really only has the core story of the abusive and obsessive love then hate affair of Alex and Holly to recommend it.<br /><br /> For this site I have also reviewed these following books of interest:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0590348086 Abduction]] by Rodman Philbrick & Lynn Harnett.<br />[[ASIN:0439903424 Being]] by Kevin Brooks.<br />Cryptid Hunters #1:  [[ASIN:0439799236 Cryptid Hunters]] by Roland Smith.<br />Cryptid Hunters #2: [[ASIN:0545204690 Tentacles]] by Roland Smith.<br />[[ASIN:0689856652 Monster Island]] by Christopher Golden & Thomas E.

By adopting her characters, Jill Paton Walsh takes on the very difficult role of living up to Sayers' standard.  In moments, she almost reaches her inspiration.<br /><br />As a modern writer, she doesn't have the grace, tone and background of classically-educated Sayers and it shows.  Overall, the dialogue was a stretch, the writing uneven, and the historical context was not quite as strong as it could be.  There are a few points where the stars align and I almost believed I was reading Sayers again, but not often enough.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Carries a Burden ... Sadly", "text": "Thank you in advance to the publisher; Revell (a division of Baker Books); for providing an advanced review copy through Library Thing. A positive review was not required in any way, nor was it requested. All words are my own.<br /><br />This is the second book I\u2019ve read by Davis Bunn, and sadly it might be my last.<br /><br />The first book I read, Unscripted, didn\u2019t seem to have much of a plot nor did it make sense to me. But, I figured it was probably me.<br /><br />After reading the blurb on this one, I was really excited and HAD to get it. In addition, the cover was a bit intriguing. So, I was VERY happy to win it on Library Thing. And, I always like to give authors a second (2nd) chance. I don\u2019t want to view one bad book and go \u201cno more\u201d. Thankfully this is a standalone read so I don\u2019t have to worry about having a book in a series that I don\u2019t want to complete.<br /><br />Right off, the character of Ethan grabbed me. A surfer, he is now dying, and has a lot of regrets, particularly surrounding his brother\u2019s unsolved murder. Ethan\u2019s former sister-in-law (Sonya) asks for his help. And, he is willing to help.<br /><br />There was SO much complexity to his character that was surprising. Right off, this starts as a tear-jerking story with so much promise. And, there were moments of great character development \u2013 Ethan is obvious, but Sonya, as well as Ethan\u2019s \u201calmost ex-wife\u201d Gina.<br /><br />After Ethan\u2019s present-day visit with Sonya, and his niece Delia \u2013 most of the story is told back some 25 years ago. Only Ethan does things much differently \u2013 the surfing competition, an investment, as well as digging into the reason for and trying to prevent his brother\u2019s murder. And, the motives seemingly tie into Sonya\u2019s company.<br /><br />A side note, despite the political climate, it is interesting that the writer chose a particular hotel/casino for Ethan\u2019s \u201cinvestment\u201d to begin. Of course the investment isn\u2019t to secure a future, but to pay for what Ethan needs to save his brother\u2019s life.<br /><br />What sounds like almost a suspense novel takes a sharp turn towards science fiction. This is not a \u201cfeel good\u201d, happily ever after read. There are a lot of twists and turns leading up to the \u201cbig reveal\u201d. And, what \u201ccould\u2019ve been\u201d seemed to languish in the end. The big reveal was a slight let-down. There was a lot of legal wrangling with some witnesses being asked \u201cleading\u201d questions.<br /><br />There were also a few \u201cterms\u201d used that were not quite right. U.S. Marshals are often called \u201cdeputies\u201d not officers.<br /><br />It started off a bit slow, kept my attention for a bit, then slowly waned. The ending and even the plot didn\u2019t seem to live up to what I was expecting from the blurb.<br /><br />The writing was solid, vivid, descriptive, and in some ways emotional. The chapters were short so that it was easy to keep moving along.<br />While no real plot holes, I was left asking \u201cwhy\u201d quite a lot during this read. Why was it so critical for Ethan to do this? Why did Sonya want Ethan\u2019s help? More importantly \u2026 why now at this point? Sonya\u2019s motives seemed mostly selfish by the beginning. Even the entire story seemed to center on something that just couldn\u2019t be touched. I kept trying to \u201cdig\u201d for the meaning.<br /><br />The science fiction aspect, science terms, and theories were a bit too far-fetched for me to truly enjoy this. And, there were seemingly no consequences for Ethan\u2019s \u201ctime-travel\u201d. In addition; the past characters of Sonya, Adrian (Ethan\u2019s brother), and Gina; all seemed to believe Ethan\u2019s story without even finding it suspicious. Even a minor character believes Ethan\u2019s story.<br /><br />Even after reading the book, I was wondering what the \u201cpoint\u201d of the story was. The title didn\u2019t seem to match what was going on.<br /><br />I\u2019m sure fans of the author and/or this type of read/genre will likely enjoy this far more than I did. And, I really tried to like it. I did love reading about some of the history (locations, songs) from 1985 as I remember that year with a certain fondness.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QByZ2I32L._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QByZ2I32L._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QByZ2I32L._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "0800727886", "parent_asin": "0800727886", "user_id": "AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ", "timestamp": 1604472114397, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Magic or Madness", "text": "A mother that drags her child from village to village running from an evil witch may not seem quite sane. That would be because she's not. Her child, Reason, the main character, seems to think her mother is perfectly ok even though she tried to kill herself twice. It really leads you to think that the evil witch grandmother can't be that bad. So when Reason is shipped off to live with the crazy witch, we assume the grandmother will turn out normal. Not quite. There is the cat with it's throat cut in the basement, and the numerous teeth in random places to be considered. I was enjoying the first half of the book where Reason explores the witch's house and befriends the next door neighbor, but everything changed when Reason goes through the back door into New York. The pace changed, and my interest waned. Reason is taken in by another 15 year old and they go around the town exploring for a few hundred pages. Then, evil grandfather enters the picture. Every adult in the book seems crazy and dangerous, and I don't see why the children made the choices that they did in the end.

I can not in good conscious go on reading these books without stating that Shiarra is To Stupid To Live (AKA TSTL). From the first book I knew Shia was short a few brain cells, but I kept holding out. She had a lot of crazy stuff going on, and each book was a struggle. However, after having the leader of the White Hats, Royce (the vampire king of New York City), and so many other people say how clever, brave, and amazing she is I can't stand it any more. Over the course of these books, she's gone from dumb to . . . ugh, just plain annoying.<br /><br />This book was hard to swallow because for the majority of it I kept going why the hell is she killing people on a whim. She has NO solid proof that the Sunstriker pack did all the evil things she thinks. Sure one of them scratched her, but she goes from never wanting to kill, to gleefully doing it. Not only that but one of the characters that I've been absolutely obsessed with turned out to be a dud. Much like this book. It felt like stepping off the cliff of this series' development. She's basically being brainwashed, and the time when she's not being brainwashed she barely second guesses herself. For the majority of the book she doesn't even worry about poor Sarah, her best friend!<br /><br />Royce is still amazing, however I can not honestly see what he sees in Shiarra. In fact, here's a little what he has to say about her:<br /><br />\"True, you are neither terribly wise nor clever--but your valor is what sets you apart.\"<br /><br />For me that valor is the one good thing about her. Also, there still isn't enough here for me to believe that a guy like Royce would fall for someone like Shiarra. He basically idolizes Shiarra since she did not take advantage of him in the first book, turning him into a mindless slave. She showed him mercy, when for others he never did. Now that felt real. The immortal creature of power finding himself with the simple act of mercy.<br /><br />Even after Shiarra gives into Royce, she continually doubts him. She switches her mind too much. \"No Royce I need you, but I feel so ashamed.\" They had this amazing moment together, and she's still convinced that Royce is going to own her. That she'll be a mindless bonded blood slave. At this point I was practically throwing the book on the ground--if it hadn't been an eBook--over the fact that Royce has proved himself many times over. (And if the preview of the next book is any indication Shiarra's going to be hot and cold.) Her prejudices and fears are justified, but a lead who's strong enough to get over them should be strong enough to stick with her guns and not feel ashamed every other word.<br /><br />This book is the turning point for me, no longer can I ignore those glaring character nesciences that Shiarra has been stirring in me. The next book is either going to save face, or it's over. (Or at least I hope I'll have the power to turn away.) This series has been a confusing addiction. There's many things that I don't like about it, and Shiarra being one of them is just not good. At this point I think my main reason for going on is Royce. Haines is a good enough author to take a character I never truly liked and make him the reason this series captivates me.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Intertwined", "text": "Title: Intertwined<br />Author: Gena Showalter<br />Genre: YA paranormal/fantasy<br /><br />Where I got it: Oregon Digital Library Consortium AKA my local library's electronic book site (audio and e-books).<br /><br />One sentence: Aden Stone, a teen with four other souls living inside him, each with a different paranormal talent (time traveling, raising the dead, seeing the future and possess other people), meets Mary Ann Gray, who silences the voices, and the two of them are dragged into supernatural danger along with a werewolf shape-shifter and a vampire princess.<br /><br />Themes: Forbidden love, supernatural abilities, family issues, danger and intrigue.<br /><br />Main character: Aden Stone was abandoned by his parents because they thought he was crazy. He's been in and out of multiple foster homes and institutions. He is an outcast with few friends, has an interesting back story and connection with Mary Ann. I didn't really feel like his personality came through as very unique or memorable, just the fact that he had four other people living inside of him.<br /><br />Secondary characters: I first thought that Mary Ann and Aden would fall in love, but it was actually really refreshing that they just remained friends. Mary Ann has had everything in the past, a stark comparison to Aden. She didn't really make much of an impact with me, although the past with her mother turned into an interesting plot point.<br />Their love interests; Victoria, the vampire princess, and her werewolf-shape-shifter bodyguard, Riley, seemed entirely one dimensional. Both seemed attracted to and sought out Mary Ann and Aden for no apparent reason. The romance was not very convincing and the characters seemed very stereotypical.<br /><br />Writing style: Showalter's writing style was both fast paced and detailed when the situation required it. Nothing popped up that jolted me out of the story, and that's how I can often judge if the writing is awkward or badly written.<br /><br />Plot: The concept of this book really drew me in, but it turned more into werewolves, vampires, faeries and goblins more than the voices in Aden's head. The first half of the book was quite different from the mess of paranormal creatures that swooped in toward the end. The twists and turns were entertaining, but also slightly overwhelming.<br /><br />Best scene: The beginning scene in the graveyard where Aden fights off zombie corpses.<br /><br />Positives: Concept, fast paced action and writing, multiple story lines with two romances<br /><br />Negatives: Characters, ending, some of the plot points were lost on me.<br /><br />Ending: Slightly thrown together. The ends were somewhat tied up (leaving room for a sequel, of course), but there was no closure.<br /><br />Verdict: Fun and entertaining, but not anything with depth. Good for a quick, light YA read.<br /><br />Rating: 6.7 / 10", "images": [], "asin": "0373210124", "parent_asin": "0373210124", "user_id": "AHYSVJUDFVO3O6OCYFCR6INURY4Q", "timestamp": 1314243698000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "A Snapshot of Cultural Differences", "text": "Although this little novella put Henry James on the map, a lot of its nuances are so far removed from our time that it seems like a slog. Several affluent Americans take extended vacations in Europe where they are confronted by a completely different European culture, thoughts, and concepts. This is, strictly, the stories purpose: to enhance the distinction between two cultures.<br /><br />Despite America being built on the immigration of Europeans, by the mid- to late-1800s Americas customs and policies in social circles had fluctuated wildly from a stricter mindset in Europe, for Henry James, specifically, Italy. Daisy Miller is dropped into these social circles with her blas\u00e9 mother and annoying, home-sick, younger brother. She discovers Mr. Winterborne who is quite stricken by her and attempts to find a balance to her boldness and his affections towards her. When Daisy travels to Rome, she finds a Mr. Giovanelli, an Italian, who adds to her reputation of being perhaps a loose woman.<br /><br />The peculiarities and remonstrance that Daisy experiences is not her favorite thing, as she insists on strictly being herself and not allowing a different culture to dictate her actions. And that's...really it for the story. Not the most invigorating material, but perhaps a good look at how Americans, and America in general, strove to buck the systems of others way back in the 1800s, too.", "images": [], "asin": "0486287734", "parent_asin": "0486287734", "user_id": "AGQ4JE3J3SN57GE46FVLTNL3YPVQ", "timestamp": 1651677635016, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

In his 40's, Thorne is a plodder and a brooder, married to his job and at times a lone wolf. All very reminiscent of Ian Rankin's John Rebus, although several of Thorne's previous cases have touched on the macabre. And the author provides plenty of British flavor - landmarks, food & drink, sports and especially slang. All in all I have enjoyed the series, but was disappointed with Death Message, which starts with an interesting premise, but then proceeds in fits and starts, with more than a few lulls.<br /><br />The book opens with our hero managing his life on a pretty even keel - for Thorne at least - and meandering through a new romantic relationship. This all changes when he receives a picture of a dead body on his phone - sent anonymously. And what soon becomes evident is that said electronic image is of a murder victim - and just the first of \"several\" Thorne receives. The identity of the culprit - and his \"motive\" - is discovered by both Thorne and the reader about a third of the way through the book and our tale becomes a \"police procedural\", with Thorne attempting to apprehend his suspect and racing the clock before the next \"death message\".<br /><br />In and of itself this lack of a mystery is not a bad thing - John Sandford with his Prey series has been wildly successful using this format. As the story progresses a psychological drama unfolds concerning our hero, the murderer and a \"third party\" from Thorne's past - not a bad twist. Unfortunately for the reader of Death Message the \"hunt\" shares the stage with, and at times takes second billing to, Thorne's romantic life. Humanizing a protagonist is fine and even interesting, but here the phrase \"too much information\" applies. Thorne's constant wrestling with his \"independence demons\" became - at least to this reader - downright tiresome - both predictable and repetitive - and much to the detriment of an otherwise fairly creative story-line.<br /><br />A so-so addition to a fairly good series.", "images": [], "asin": "006143275X", "parent_asin": "006143275X", "user_id": "AFGEL7XKPUAHC4TE4DUYL4D5XLUQ", "timestamp": 1338913652000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Abandoning his damaged ship, Cephean decides to ship, and team-up with Gev, so that both can use each other to escape their shipwrecked status.<br /><br /> The only trouble is, and this will be no surprise to anybody, that neither is really compatible with each other.  But to escape their situation in the flux they have to learn to work together, and match their rigger imagery, so that they can maneuver to a civilized system.<br /><br /> And that is what the first quarter or so of this book is all about, as Carver takes his time to explain how the flux works, hell, he waits for a couple of chapters to do this, leaving his readers confused as what is going on.  As the two being's personalities clash, they have to learn how to get along and become partners to survive, which will be difficult as Gev and Cephean\u2019s personalities are both disparate, and similar, at the same time.<br /><br /> Since this part of the novel that is the only part that\u2019s described on the dust jacket, you would get the mistaken impression that this part is the whole novel, and it is not.  It's only the first quarter or so, and it will be no surprise to readers that Gev and Cephean succeed in finding some common ground, and that they find their way to Chaening's World which is &#34;Lady Brillig&#34;'s homeworld.  And now that they are there, Gev will find much disappointment as the \u201cLady Brillig\u201d is no more, and his friends, the other star-riggers have scattered to different parts of the stars.  And so the rest of the novel becomes a semi-detective story as Gev and Cephean move from planet to planet looking for some trace of the only family that Gev has ever really had.  And because Gev considers the other three star-riggers as his ersatz family, he can\u2019t rest until all three are found.<br /><br /> The main problem with this novel is that Gev is such a passive and depressive character to spend much time with.  He is written as an emotionally monotonically and low-key personality through-out the whole novel.  Gev seems to be unable to appreciate any of the good things that happen to him, or to relate to anybody he meets, including his finding a beautiful and successful woman, who wants nothing more than to love and be devoted to him.<br /><br /> Another problem is the Cynthian.  He\u2019s your clich\u00e9d cat hiding behind an anthropomorphic and alien form.  He's indifferent, passive, low-key, indecisive, and fussy.  It\u2019s also never explained how a cat species with non-prehensile paws could develop space travel.  I don't believe for a second that the riffmar could do all of the hard work of building the cynthian\u2019s spaceships.  But with Carver concentrating more on Gev than any of the other characters, none, including Cepheon ever come across as a fully-fleshed out character, as any and all attempts at developing them is filtered through the low-energied Gev.  So, eventually all of their characterizations go nowhere in the novel.<br /><br /> Carver tosses in a few action scenes, like space pirates, to spice things up, but they seem to come across as more of plot contrivances, there just to keep the thin plot moving more than anything else.<br /><br /> I wasn't bored, but the story, and the contrived hallucinogenic imagery of the flux, a dimension which is never really explained,  just kept failing to hold my attention in Carver\u2019s episodic novel.  &#34;Star Rigger's Way&#34; started off as a published novella, and it might have worked better that way, because even at its short length it is just a little too long.<br /><br /> I read the book club edition and I thought the cover well drawn, but not very good as far as being representative of this novel\u2019s story  Eventually, this novel would receive a sequel in 2000 called &#34;Eternity's End&#34;, which would detail the adventures of one of this novel's minor characters.<br /><br /> For this site I have read these other science fiction books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0765321734 Bone Dance: A Fantasy for Technophiles]] by Emma Bull.<br />[[ASIN:0385127847 Cowboy Heaven]] by Ron Goulart.<br />[[ASIN:0380899175 The Duchess of Kneedeep]] by Atanielle Annyn No\u00ebl.<br />[[ASIN:B0062CPTP6 The Flying Eyes]] by J.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Good world and supporting characters,  Main character grew more annoying as the book went on", "text": "***Contains minor spoilers***<br /><br />I'd read this book once long ago and remembered not loving it, but liking it just enough to give book 2 a shot.  Well, it took a long time for me to get my hands on book 2.  When I did I started reading it and realized I had no clue what was going on.  So I borrowed this book from the library again to refresh my memory.<br /><br />It starts out strong.  I liked this version of the fae and the world building.  I wasn't sure about McKenzie, as at times she seems strong and kick-ass, but other times she just doesn't seem to have much thought going on in her head.  Her continual escape attempts were one example.  The first couple made sense, but after it was clear that a quick escape wasn't going to work, she should have bidded her time and planned something out.  Instead, she kept just trying to rabbit every time everyone looked the other way, to increasingly painful consequences as everyone (most of whom weren't fond of her to begin with) got increasingly fed up with her.<br /><br />For a while I appreciated how she held firm to the Court side of things and didn't easily accept anything the Rebels told her.  It was refreshing to have a story where neither side is monstrously bad (though both side occasionally do bad things), so it was difficult to tell which side she should chose.  After a while it got frustrating as she flip-flopped her way through the book.  She did eventually pick a side for the war, but couldn't pick between the two love interests even at the end of the book.  She thinks she did, but it's clear she feels guilty about the choice, which means the love triangle will continue into book 2.  No thank you.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Readers who are not critical thinkers will enjoy this book", "text": "XXXXX<br /><br />I bet you didn't know these facts:<br /><br />(1) \"Men use about seven thousand words per day.  Women use about twenty-thousand.\"<br />(2) \"Girls arrive already wired as girls, and boys arrive already wired as boys.\"<br />(3) \"Men are on average twenty times more aggressive than women.\"<br />(4) \"Girls are motivated--on a molecular and neurological level--to ease and prevent social conflict.\"<br />(5) \"85% of twenty- to thirty-year-old males think about sex every fifty-two seconds and women think about it once a day--up to three or four times on fertile days.\"<br />(6) \"Men pick up the subtle signs of sadness in a female face only 40 percent of the time, whereas women can pick up these signs 90 percent of the time.\"<br />(7) \"65 percent of divorces after the age of fifty are initiated by women.\"<br /><br />These seven facts are some of the interesting information that you'll learn in this book by Louann Brizendine M.D., a neuropsychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and founder of the Women's and Teen Girls' Mood and Hormone Clinic.<br /><br />The thesis of this book is that the female brain sees the world differently and reacts differently than the male brain in every stage of life from newborn to old age.  A women's behavior is radically different from that of a man due to mainly hormonal differences.  This book is quite easy to read and, in fact, reads like a novel.<br /><br />However, I found the book to have minimal neuroscience (as suggested by the book's title).  It was comprised mainly of anecdotes (some autobiographical) that exaggerate the differences between women and men thus reinforcing gender stereotypes.  As well, I found many contradictions throughout.  In places of her book, Brizendine is also surprisingly na\u00efve.<br /><br />When I was reading this book, what struck me was the exactness of some of the facts the author presents (such as the seven presented above).  So I decided to search on the Internet for other reviews of this book from mainly scholarly sources.  The avalanche of negative information I found was astounding!!<br /><br />A major problem concerned her extensive endnotes.<br /><br />From reading this mass of negative information, it seems to me that Brizendine is attempting to present an authoritative voice to impress despite what the authors say in her numerous endnotes.  That is, her supporting citations don't support her claims.  If you couple this with Brizendine's impressive academic credentials (highlighted especially in the book's acknowledgements section and inside back flap), then most people, unfortunately, accept everything she says at face value.  (By the way, the seven \"facts\" above are not supported by Brizendine's citations.)<br /><br />I was intrigued by this so I checked out Brizendine's brief biography on the book's inside back flap.  A piece of information that intrigued me states that \"She has written in professional texts and journals.\"  What I wanted to know was how many professional research papers she has written in.  Again from searching on the Internet I found she had written exactly 7 research papers in collaboration with others and she's not the first named author in any of the seven.  (To put this in context, her colleague in the Psychiatry Department at UCSF, Associate Professor Steven P. Hamilton has published 24 papers since 1994 and is first listed author on 11.)<br /><br />For a \"pioneering neuropsychiatrist,\" (honest, this is what it says on the book's inside front flap) she has a poor research paper publication rate.<br /><br />At the beginning of her endnotes and references section, she states in a preamble the following:<br /><br />\"I have gathered the work of many scientists in various disciplines in order to arrive at this understanding of the female brain.\"<br /><br />From my understanding of this quotation, she used only the work of only scientists to establish her claims.  However, in her references are works authored by Allen Pease and Allan Garner.  These people are not scientists!!<br /><br />Also, in this preamble she calls everything she has written in her book a \"theory\" (a collection of  general principles that is put forward as an explanation for a set of known facts and empirical findings).  I found her theory to be quite rigid since she doesn't allow for or explain any exceptions (there are many) and this undermines her entire theory.  Yes, men and woman's brains are different but within each gender, you'll find a wide range of behavior.  To ignore this fact as Brizendine does is to present a very narrow view of human experience.<br /><br />I have to agree with an October 2006 article in the publication \"Nature\" that was entitled \"Psychoneuroindoctrinology\" (a pun on the word pyschoneuroendrocrinology) which states that this book \"fails to meet even the most basic standards of accuracy and balance,\" \"is riddled with scientific errors,\" and \"is misleading about the processes of brain development, the neuroendocrine system, and the nature of sex differences in general.\"<br /><br />Finally, I should explain my rating for this book.  The majority of those who are not critical thinkers will probably give this book 5 stars.  The majority of those who ARE critical thinkers will probably give this book 1 star.  My rating is the average of these two extremes.<br /><br />In conclusion, those readers who are not critical thinkers will probably thoroughly enjoy this book.  Critical thinking readers will probably have the opposite response!!<br /><br />{first published 2006;  acknowledgements;  the female brain (a human brain diagram with captions);  cast of neuro-hormone characters (list of hormones with descriptions that affect a woman's brain);  phases of a female's life (chart);  introduction;  seven chapters;  epilogue;  main narrative 165 pages;  3 appendices;  notes;  references;  index}<br /><br />XXXXX", "images": [], "asin": "0767920090", "parent_asin": "0767920090", "user_id": "AFBD2EAYRHPQAUQAPPB3C6GAVX3Q", "timestamp": 1181832951000, "helpful_vote": 189, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "The Great American Whatever by Tim Federle", "text": "This book seemed to be exactly my type of book: diversity, romance, laughs, and a hard-hitting event that can make the reader think. This book has all of the above and then some, so it's no surprise that I liked it.<br />  Quinn's biggest dream was to become the guy to write movies and end up in Hollywood. But then something happens to make him question everything he thought before. He stopped doing anything besides existing until his best friend drags him out of the house and to a party..... Where he finally meets a guy whom he falls hard for. It looks like things are starting to look up for him!<br />  Although the romance was what I looked forward to, it wasn't there for most of the book. It gave it a slow burn and made it so that even the reader knows how the tough outre shell was coming off Quinn. It was nice to see the way they fell together.<br />  What really captured my attention was the diversity. I loved that it seemed so natural and wasn't filled with stereotypes that some books have. It helped it to lean heavily on the realistic side and not so much the fiction. It refreshing to not have to roll my eyes with every page turn.<br />  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the plot. It was a little slow moving for my taste, but it helped to binge read it instead of breaking it into parts. There were times when I really fell into the story, but for the most part there wasn't really anything happening and it was a bunch of backstory.<br />  This book was filled with different thigns that I love so there was no surprise that I would like the overall book.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A book with controversial topics and a not-so-subtle directed narrative", "text": "Oofta. A very popular book, but this was a distressing read for me. It probably didn\u2019t help that I had recently watched an equally distressing episode of Bull with a similarly difficult custody case with the added element of race. Custody cases are usually complex and hardly ever win/win situations, especially in adoptions, so my distress isn\u2019t necessarily from what the author chose the outcome of the case to be, that I believe it to be \u201cwrong.\u201d I did have an opinion but I could see both sides. My distress in this book was more with how the author portrayed the situation or particular characters. Thus, 3 stars- you might love it, you might not; matter of personal preference.<br /><br />It is obvious the author is not afraid of controversy, covering topics like adoption, child custody, race, abortion, surrogacy, parenting, and socioeconomic differences all in one story. So this review will probably be all over the place in representation of my thoughts and feelings!<br /><br />The book starts with the Richardson\u2019s house burning down and the family suspecting the youngest, \u2018troublesome,\u2019 seemingly missing child, Izzy, was responsible. So I thought the story would be centered around that event and finding Izzy, etc. But that didn\u2019t come back up until the very very end. And really the story was more about the Richardson\u2019s tenant, Mia, and Mrs. Richardson, than Izzy, though her and the other characters have their moments.<br /><br />There is a lot of focus on Mia and I felt the author painted her as the \u2018hero\u2019 of the story, almost saint-like. She was the stereotypical free-spirit artist who was not \u2018bound\u2019 by social boxes of expectation but lived a nomadic lifestyle, doing whatever it took to be able to focus on and create her super profound and brilliant art that \u2018unelightened\u2019 people just didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m an art major, and maybe I just chose the wrong field and don\u2019t have the true artist spirit, but I find this character tired and annoying. She is depicted as if she is the only person willing to think for herself or push against the status quo. That she is on a whole new level of enlightenment and all the other characters would do well to be more like her and glean from her infinite wisdom. That any choice she makes or has made was right and pure. And that\u2019s just bogus. Of course she\u2019s not the opposite of all of that, but she sure isn\u2019t the blueprint for all that is good.<br /><br />And because of the author\u2019s depiction of Mia and because she clearly chose a side to her friend\u2019s custody battle (even instigating it), it leads one to believe the author was writing from a biased opinion.<br /><br />In contrast to Mia, the adopting mother was portrayed as a rich, white, ignorant, and basically subconscious racist woman who was only adopting out of selfishness and the desire for a \u2018perfect\u2019 home in her \u2018perfect\u2019 neighborhood. I found this off-putting. Of all the people the author could have chosen to represent this mother, she chose this on purpose, and I believe, to make a statement, one of which rubs me the wrong way. While she did touch on the mother\u2019s anguish of experiencing many miscarriages and the struggle to get pregnant unsuccessfully and the previous adoptions that fell through, the dialogue the author chose to use during the trial at the end was far from compassionate and understanding. I realize there are really people out there like this, but I found it in bad taste that she would choose to write this story the way she did.<br /><br />Here\u2019s the gist: The McCullough\u2019s have tried for years and years to have a baby, naturally and through adoption. And nothing has worked. Finally they are almost finished adopting an American-Chinese baby when Mia realizes it\u2019s the baby her friend, Bebe, left at a fire station a year ago because she did not have the means to care for her and lets her know. Well now Bebe has a waitressing job and decides she wants her daughter back. She believes the McCullough\u2019s have no right to adopt her baby. The author even writes Izzy to constantly call the McCullough\u2019s and her lawyer dad who is representing them- \u2018baby-stealers.\u2019 Like I said, no easy answer by any means, but this is a far cry from baby-stealing. And what\u2019s played up is the idea of race and culture. The trial dialogue that is presented when Mrs. McCullough is on the stand is basically- \u2018What do you plan to do to teach the baby about her birth culture?... Wait, you\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t speak any dialect of Chinese, you have no Asian dolls, no books about Asian characters, and you think just feeding her Chinese food and buying her a panda stuffed animal and take her on a rich person\u2019s tour of China will be enough?? You are an unfit mother!!!\u2019 Everything else they can provide for her and the fact that they\u2019ve already had her for months and love her and have cared for her after she was malnourished  and left on the steps is thrown out the window. I totally understand that there is value in knowing your birth culture but if that is what gives you worth and identity as a person, then there are a lot of people out there that will never live fulfilled lives. Can a custody case really come down to who can teach the baby the most about her birth culture, let alone in that very moment? Obviously the birth mother is still her biological mother who loves the baby as well, so it\u2019s not an open and shut case about who should mother the child, I was just disappointed with the way the author chose to write about it and the characters.<br /><br />Add to that the way the author ended the book and it\u2019s hard not to see a particular narrative the author was trying to persuade readers to believe.<br /><br />Another comment on the writing of the book- I didn\u2019t like the voice of the narrator, constantly giving background info on a character that the character whose POV you were reading from would have no knowledge of like \u2018[insert three chapters describing Mia\u2019s past] of course Mrs. Richardson would only find out part of this\u2019 or talking about irrelevant future information like \u2018Mia wouldn\u2019t know this yet but two years from now she would look back and think...\u2019 That voice mixed with a variety of POVs throughout the book was a little obnoxious.<br /><br />Probably an excessively long review but I cannot be more concise with my feelings at the moment.<br /><br />The controversial topics and situations will challenge your thinking, depending on your worldview, and will cause a variety of feelings. And honestly I don\u2019t mind being challenged to to think about why I have the opinions I do, I think that\u2019s healthy and important, but I felt this author did a little too much hand-holding and persuasion in her writing and character portrayal for me to feel good about any of it right now. Knowing how popular this book is, I was a little surprised by what I read, but I guess, as always, you will have to decide for yourself whether it\u2019s a ride worth taking.", "images": [], "asin": "0735224315", "parent_asin": "0735224315", "user_id": "AEX6GC25ANZIT36EQGUAJOGXCPLQ", "timestamp": 1598927011499, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

We know who the killer/ bad guy is from the first couple pages, and as his reign of murder continues throughout the novel it's fairly predictable. Although I read this one extremely quickly, it's enjoyment was limited. There are two additional books in this series so far. I'll read the next two books in this series since I'm a Reinhard fan.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Very Epic, but very little new.", "text": "The Unremembered is Peter Orullian's very Epic debut. It is Epic in nearly every way. In terms of characters/points of view, battles/skirmishes, plot evasiveness, big magic, along with the scope of the land and its associated cultures. There is also a dark god of a sort who is at the heart of the matter, but little seen. All in all The Unremembered is very reminiscent of Robert Jordan and Eddings so if that is your cup of tea then afternoon tea is ready for you. But if you're expecting much more beyond that than look elsewhere as only a few things differentiate it from its forebears.<br /><br />The Unremembered starts with a prologue that while straight forward enough still leaves so much, perhaps too much, to the imagination involving a race of god like beings responsible for the creation of the world and many others. There is a casting out of one of the gods who is apparently behind all the evil of the world.  We are then flung thousands of years in the future on the world where evil is spreading in a small village where teenage friends Tahn, Sutter, and Wendra are somehow at the crux of some evil plot.<br /><br />The dense story does take awhile to grab hold as things are left sketchy for the main characters as they are dragged around. One thing that tends to grate on me in Epic Fantasy is the reliance on keeping the main character out of the loop following around people blindly, which is the case here. The leads are pushed around and bloodied without so much as a word of why for hundreds of pages from their all-knowing wizard leader.<br /><br />Sometimes I was completely enveloped in the rich and lush world and then I'd get all annoyed because characters kept getting side tracked again and again, which doesn't do much for the core story. Too many flights, too many partings, and predictable meetings. The magic and story are complex and the use of music as magic was interesting, but not well enough explained to fully grasp. Apparently the next volume will go further into it.<br /><br />The Unremembered does shows promise for what could be a remarkable world and cast, but it isn't there yet and I'm not sure Orullian's goal with the story would get it there. The story seems enmeshed in tropes that it loses itself in. The best part of the novel is the relationships, especially between Tahn and Sutter which is what kept me coming back for more. I give The Unremembered 5 out of 10 hats, but the 14 year-old in me would probably give it an 8 if I hadn't read some Jordan prior. I think I'm just a different reader now and expect different things out of my Fantasy then I did even 5 years ago.<br /><br />If you are a fan of 80's and 90's Epic Fantasy and still savor for more than The Unremembered is for you.

We were somewhat surprised that while this entry spans the period of 1945 to about 1958, the just concluded World War gets hardly a mention. Rather, the story now centers more on Harry and Emma's son Sebastian and his years finishing high school and bound for Cambridge. Early on, the debate over Harry's paternity, and therefore the inheritance of the Barrington estate, is resolved; so that settles the cliffhanger from book 2. Later, Giles Barrington is involved in an election rigging scheme as he runs for re-election to Parliament; his troubles with a new wife and an insider trading scam with the family's shipping company also absorb a lot of ink. Finally, an adventure with Sebastian disappearing on a trip to Buenos Aires to unwittingly abet a smuggling attempt concludes this third tale. Once again, a cliffhanger has us anxiously awaiting the next installment.<br /><br />While we continue to find Archer's extended yarn engaging, it seemed the \"setup\" work in \"Secret\" got a little long and dry. The relatively abrupt departure of Harry's involvement apparently signals that the next generation is now center stage - and where that might lead is by no means obvious. While we realize we readers are being masterfully strung along, and have no reservations about following the set to its conclusion, we somehow didn't muster quite the same enthusiasm with this outing.

Gemma and Fee are waiting to enter society as women and Ann is preparing to become a nanny. The girls have much to discover, such as their desires, destines and who are their true friends and enemies.<br /><br />The book is a long 800+ pages, and to be frank sometimes it felt like it. The book starts out with a lot of talk about balls and the Victorian Era. For people who want to read about the Realms and Kartik the first 200/300 pages maybe a bit tiresome. Also I felt the book could have moved a little more quickly. Around page 600 or so I found myself flipping through the pages in order to get to the good stuff.<br /><br />The writing is good. The plot dragged a tad, and after much thought I agree Gemma's character didn't progress as I hoped it would.<br /><br />The ending is bittersweet for Gemma and many readers are having a difficult time with this. I can understand that because when I read Little Women I was upset when Jo refused to marry Laurie. Still, the readers' passion impresses me because these are teens that care deeply for characters in a YA book series.

He is still very much a product of a culture full of privilege for white men that has little interest in diversity. American Business hasn't evolved. It's still a one note choir that ignores the rest of the scale. And Musk doesn't seem to have any awareness of this. He's blind.<br /><br />Musk also wants to take us to Mars, but, as I read, I found myself asking, what's the point of going to Mars if our culture can't figure out how to sustain a planet or incorporate a diverse population?

{"rating": 1, "title": "This is a THIN book", "text": "When I got the package in the (snail) mail today, my first impression was \"this is a THIN book\".  So much for expectations.  Steven's first book, Aethro-kinematics, was (is) the same size pages, but it is one and a quarter inches thick, and 523 pages.<br /><br />Aethro-Dynamics is just shy of 1/2 inches thick, and 153 pages.<br /><br />The first real section (the 1st section is a one page insert of the CD containing the book, Aethro-kinematics) is magnetism (Ferromagnetism as if there is a difference).<br /><br />Steven provides us with more historical prospective of the inquiry into the mystery of magnetism, just like he did in his first book.  This one has more references to \"other people's opinions\", which is of little help, since these \"giants\" never did figure out how magnets work.  Steven provides us with the same theory from book one, that magnetism is a \"flow\" of aether. Nothing new here.<br />And he skipped over any reasoning for why the magnet \"flow\" only affects iron sized molecules.  Steven and I talked (1995) about the need for some special attribute of this flow to distinguish between Aluminum, Iron, Gold, and Wood.<br /><br />The forth section is labeled \"Revisiting gravity, free fall and inertia\".  The historical review is good or better than the first book, BUT after repeating his Aether sink-vortex theory (from book 1), Steven still can not bring himself to say that Gravity equals the vertical flow of the Aether.  The best he could do was<br />to hedge his language with \"Aethro-kinematics, thus postulated a centripetal, spiral gravitational inflow of Aether into all accreting Matter.\" Page 135.<br /><br />I was not nearly as impressed with this book as I was with the first book, 15 years ago.", "images": [], "asin": "0966757181", "parent_asin": "0966757181", "user_id": "AGFMN322XYVIPI7MB2AAGY4X3VVA", "timestamp": 1267753341000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 2, "title": "Vicarious Bookworm Reviews", "text": "First, let\u2019s look at this cover. It\u2019s gorgeous and I\u2019m totally in love with the font! It\u2019s what sucked me in and made me read the summary. \u201cA princess with a forbidden magical gift is shipped off to a neighboring kingdom to marry a prince, but she has to choose between her duty and her heart when she falls in love with his roguish horse-training sister instead.\u201d Obviously, after a summary like that I had to read this book. But you, my fellow bookworms, know how it is with the TBR piles and the such\u2026 so I never got around to it until the #DAReadAThon pushed me into reading it for the Stupefy prompt and the Beat the Backlist Challenge pushed me to kill off some of my ever-expanding TBR pile. I also recently joined the Diversely Booked Book Club, which happens to be reading Of Fire and Stars for January. Everyone I saw speaking about Of Fire and Stars on social media showered it with praises. Now, I feel like I should have read a few of the Goodreads reviews before selecting it because I\u2019m pretty disappointed.<br /><br />The characters are very two-dimensional. There is minimal development even on the two point-of-view characters, Mare and Denna. For secondary characters, the development is literally non-existent. Everyone is either good or bad with no grey area or depth to be found anywhere. I was especially disappointed in the lack of depth of both Thandi and Alisendi because they had such important roles to the main story. I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you anything about them aside from Thandi\u2019s unwillingness to listen to reason and Alisendi\u2019s hope that her sister will stuff herself into the role that has been forced upon her by her station.<br /><br />The world is much like the characters within it: falling sadly flat with little description of it aside from the separation or unity of Affinities and the Six Gods, who are not elaborated upon beyond the affinities they represent. Hints are given as to the existence of a specific \u201corder\u201d in which the Gods should be displayed based on religious sect, but the actual order and representative colors are never given. Almost no elaboration is given to regional cultures, languages, or daily life. Vague hints are given to climate differences of different regions as well as regional preferences for a single specified god of the six available for three of the regions discussed.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most is the plethora of questions that stuck with me at the end of the story, especially since it didn\u2019t seem like the author was really trying for a cliff-hanger. How did the information get out of the castle and into the two rivaling factions ears with such speed and accuracy? How was the Directorate able to capture so many of the Recusants when they couldn\u2019t even figure out where their new meeting location was? I also have a question as to why the author picked who she did as the villain, but to ask openly would spoil the entire book and I try so very hard not to post spoilers in my reviews. Needless to say the end, like much of the rest of the book, left me frustrated.<br /><br />The only thing I really enjoyed about Of Fire and Stars was the romance between Mare and Denna, but even that left something to be desired. I will admit I spent most of the book anticipating the romance between the two of them, which carried me through much of the story by itself. Said anticipation (and my curiosity of where the story would take the two of them) allowed me to read the book in only a day. Out of that curiosity, I might read a sequel if it were published but I\u2019d likely stick with the library instead of purchasing it. The idea behind this story had so much promise and the follow-through just wasn\u2019t up to my expectations of it.<br /><br />For this review and more, please visit my blog, Vicarious Bookworm", "images": [], "asin": "0062433253", "parent_asin": "0062433253", "user_id": "AFKFOYY7M2WJT2UQTIBNX7V4XOOA", "timestamp": 1484234671000, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not good, not bad, just meh", "text": "\u201cWe don\u2019t get to choose what hurts us\u201d<br /><br />I had been wanting to read this book since its release in 2019. It sounded a little spooky with high stakes, fantasy elements, and sapphic themes. All of those things are right up my alley and putting them together? I just assumed it would be a slam dunk read.<br /><br />Sadly, this book fell firmly into what I call the \u201cmeh\u201d category.<br /><br />We all know the \u201cmeh\u201d category. Not good, not bad, it just kind of exists in a purgatory of not eliciting emotions one way or the other. One of the major themes of this book is body horror. A group of girls are quarantined on an island that houses their school after some sort of disease broke out that caused their bodies and, eventually, minds to mutate in horrific ways. These physical mutations are described for nearly every person our lead character comes across in the book and, well, it did nothing for me. The descriptions sounded like something a pre-teen boy would come up with in a ludicrous story he tells his friends. \u201cThere\u2019s something living behind her eyes, guys! And she can\u2019t open her eye! They sew it closed!\u201d Yawn.<br /><br />(Minor spoilers) Throughout the story the idea of fierce loyalty bred from necessity is enforced multiple times. These girls are trapped in their school with mutated animals bent on devouring them knocking at their doors. They only have each other and they protect one another. However, when push comes to shove our leading characters abandon their schoolmates without a second thought, focused only on themselves and their own wants.<br /><br />Overall, I didn\u2019t understand the point of this book. Quite frankly, there didn\u2019t seem to be one. There was a problem with no solution proposed, by the end the stakes had been stripped away, and the presented character developments meant nothing. The only saving grace of this story is that the writing style had good flow and after the first quarter of the story or so there were no lulls to drag you into boredom.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Does better when discussing the impact of politics on the economy", "text": "The poor performance of Arab economies has been well documented, including in the much-cited Arab Human Development Report written by Arab intellectuals for the U.N. Development Program.[1] But the numbers, no matter how well presented, do not necessarily bring to life how Arab economies actually work as seen by the ordinary businessman or government official. Drawing heavily on his experience from 1998 to 2001 as The Wall Street Journal's Middle East correspondent, Glain provides a series of anecdotes about the lack of government transparency and accountability as well as the other main barriers to economic efficiency. He provides neither a structured or comprehensive account of how the economies work, much less what is needed to improve them. Glain's account is not the place to look for analysis about high politics and diplomacy. He touches on these subjects at times, but what he has to say is of uneven quality-this is obviously not his strong point. In particular, his comments about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict are not insightful.<br /><br />He does better when discussing the impact of politics on the economy where he skillfully musters tales from individual businessmen to bring to life how \"ham-fisted, risk averse bureaucracy\" stifles the rich talent of Arab entrepreneurs and workers. He gives a feel for life's frustrations with stories focused on the main problem of excessive state interference, in all its corruption, neglect, and bad management.<br /><br />Glain considers six areas in successive chapters: Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt, and Iraq. The best chapters by far are those on Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. These bring out how political interference has made two economies with such enormous potential into failures. He is particularly skillful at exposing the wide gaps between rhetoric about economic reform and the unpleasant realities of the continued dead hand of political interference to protect the well-placed. The Syria chapter is impeded by the difficulty of gathering information, and the Iraq chapter suffers from the problem of gauging how the economy is functioning under the peculiar circumstances of an occupation after decades of tyrannical rule.<br /><br />Glain writes with obvious empathy for the suffering Arab peoples, and his confidence in their potential-if freed of such depressing governments-shines through. His account is a good example of the principle that the true friends of the Arabs are those who tell the brutal truth about the poor state to which they have been reduced by their leaders.<br /><br />Patrick Clawson<br /><br />[1] See \"How the Arabs Compare: Arab Human Development Report 2002,\" Middle East Quarterly, Fall 2002, pp. 59-67.", "images": [], "asin": "0312329113", "parent_asin": "0312329113", "user_id": "AFGKAUWLM5BJYCF5BUQSKJBHWPRQ", "timestamp": 1123948710000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "A nicely constructed plot with interesting characters", "text": "Dr. Daniel Rinaldi, a Pittsburgh psychologist, gets involved in two police cases. The first involves Wesley Currim, an unpleasant, wise-cracking young man who's confessed to the murder and decapitation of rich executive Edward Meacham. Wes's mother Maggie, however, swears she was with her son at the time of the murder and implores Dr. Rinaldi to help the boy.<br /><br />At the same time Rinaldi is working with the FBI on a case involving serial killer John Jessup, who was convicted of murdering four prostitutes. Jessup, who was killed in a prison riot, had an admirer who wrote him complimentary, supportive letters signed 'Your Biggest Fan'. The admirer is now on a murder spree of his own, killing people responsible for Jessup's imprisonment and death. This seems to includes a prison guard, the judge, the prosecutor, jurors, the defense attorney, and Lyle Barnes, the FBI profiler who fingered Jessup. Barnes now suffers from night terrors and needs the help of a psychologist.<br /><br />Local police are working with the FBI to protect potential victims and nab Jessup's admirer. They're hampered, however, because the killer seems to have inside information: he knows where the authorities are hiding potential victims, knows when they're about to question a witness, etc.  Clearly, the investigation is compromised in some fashion.<br /><br />While working on the cases Rinaldi can't seem to go a day without getting involved in a life-threatening situation such as chasing down a gunman, being run off the road by truck, putting himself in the path of a murderer, and so on. This seems unwise since Rinaldi apparently doesn't carry a weapon or possess martial arts skills. To me, he's somewhat of an unrealistic character - a sort of psychololgist/superhero - but he seems to be a decent enough guy. There's also a touch of romance in the story since Rinaldi gets together with Detective Eleanor Lowrey, a woman he's been attracted to for some time.<br /><br />Eventually Rinaldi comes across information that's pivotal to both cases which leads to the book's climax. I thought this was a pretty good story with interesting characters and a nicely-constructed plot.", "images": [], "asin": "1464201315", "parent_asin": "1464201315", "user_id": "AHNZRQNJHNSBVKERNXSWNLKOZ6YQ", "timestamp": 1424633618000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Whine and No Love", "text": "I was hoping this book would be a legitimate critique of the influence of a few wine writers like Robert Parker on the wine business.  Instead, the \"Battle for Wine and Love\" contains a narrative of Ms. Feiring's personal issues disguised as a combination autobiography and manifesto related to her job as a writer.<br /><br />The reason for not giving this book just one star, is that despite the annoying, self-indulgent nonsense, she does make one valid point.  The wine industry, including both large and small producers, are modifying their products to achieve high ratings from Parker, the Wine Spectator, and other influential publications.  As a consequence, more wines are emphasizing fruit over complexity, and the uniqueness of regional character may be falling way to a globalization of taste.  But in her discussion, she fails to recognize that wine is a product to be created, sold, and consumed.  The small producers for whom she has such affection produce wine to make a living; a fact that seems to escape the author.<br /><br />Burying this point in a sniveling diatribe that is as much about her upbringing and depressing love life (although there seems to be very little love involved)completely ruins what could have been an interesting read.<br /><br />Feiring sets up Robert Parker as some kind of evil force; but, when she interviews him she neither provides the full interview nor adequately captures the essence of it.  She makes it clear at the end of the chapter containing the interview that she really wasn't looking for a dialogue, but wanted to just tell him off.<br /><br />It is the author's self righteous tone that most diminishes the value of this book.  She claims to have a superior palate; she finds her surprisingly loyal friends to be an embarrassment; and she seems surprised why she has real difficulties with relationships.<br /><br />After completing this book, I poured a much needed glass of wine and took the time to enjoy it.

This may be the most expensive book and horrible time-waster I've ever seen. I was so excited when first getting the book with such great outfits, I didn't pay enough attention to the back of the book with the \"patterns\". Just saw the sturdy paper there and planned on copying on printer.. Big mistake. The \"full-sized patterns\" are a horror.The patterns are on 20\" x 30\" paper, laid out to conserve space, and impossible to fit onto a printer. The pattern pieces are arranged so poorly that you'll be lucky to get 2 pieces on an 8x12 sheet of paper. Many of them are too large even for that and must be pieced together for the full size. There are 98 pieces --it will take a full cartridge to print them. Plastic sheets for the pieces? $$$. Transfer paper? probably 40-50 sheets. The best description I can give to the way the patterns were done is: CHEAP,CHINCY,DUMB. ORIGINAL REVIEW:  First-had ordered the book, Doll Fashion Studio: Sew 20 Seasonal Outfits for Your 18-Inch Doll, from another seller for a slightly lower price, but it was backordered for 6-8 weeks. Amazon to the rescue--ordered,Prime, and a few days later, it was on my doorstep. Instant love. Yes, it does have 1 drawback, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. The patterns are printed on both sides of the pages, but it's such a minor annoyance, you'll forgive Joan Hinds. Also, I plan on making templates of the pattern pieces, so tracing them out won't bother me a bit. You'll really like the fact that the pattern pieces are on sturdy paper at the back of the book. You'll be able to utilize the instuctions (really liberal with pictures of all the pieces) without leaving the instruction pages for the outfit. The book also answered another question I've been trying to decide on what to craft for St. Jude and other children's charities. It has several projects which will be great for dolls, but can also be adapted for little ones undergoing treatment. Just wish I could have afforded the DVD.

That being said, this book is kind of a let down after that.  While it was still well written for children and does envelop the horse culture that is Chincoteague, the story almost seems incomplete and not very fleshed out.<br /><br />Its the next Pony Penning day at Chinconteague and before all the wild ponies of Assateague can be driven over to the island, Paul and Maureen are approached by some movie makers wanting to buy Misty, their pony they had gotten the year before.  Misty is beloved to them and they have a hard time letting her go, but need the money to send their uncle to college and also think other children should be able to experience the wonderfulness that is Misty.  With the emptiness that fills their hearts after letting her go, they need to find something to ease the pain.  Luckily, they find an orphaned foal whom they call Sea Star and claim him for their very own.  He doesn't want to eat however, and is not thriving very well. Maureen and Paul have to find a way to save him.<br /><br />The characters in this book are not as fleshed out.  Although they are the same as from the previous books, they just don't have as much warmth to them and even Grandpa Beebe seems a little less cheerful.  Grandma Beebe gets a few more lines in this book which was nice to see, but still remains a minor character.  The book mostly focuses on Paul and Maureen but they are often doing things rather than experiencing them and showing emotion (the exception being when they make the decision to sell Misty).<br /><br />This book is still very well written for kids.  Most of it is easy to read and understand and has a simplicity that even the younger ages can handle.  There isn't anything offensive in this book and it is appropriate for all ages.  I do find some flaws in the writing though, although a lot happens in this book there is scant description and the ending seemed incomplete.  Another fifty pages or so would definitely help the book and bring the story along more.<br /><br />It was an ok book, just not as good as some of Henry's others.

Ronnie's girlfriend, Tracy, tells Detective Inspector John Rebus that Ronnie was distraught before he died, and repeatedly cried &quot;hide, hide.&quot; At first it looks like Ronnie overdosed, but Rebus learns that Ronnie's dope was tainted with rat poison.<br /><br />Because Rebus is involved in a drug case his boss, Superintendent Watson, invites the detective to lunch with a few Edinburgh bigwigs who are involved with an anti-drug campaign. Rebus seems to be of interest to these rich, successful men, who invite him to a classy party and give him an 'honorary membership' in a gambling club.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tracy reports that she's being followed, and Rebus notices that he's being followed as well. It's clear that someone is interested in Rebus's investigation, and he has to find out why. To assist with his inquiries, Rebus reaches out to Sergeant Brian Holmes - the cop least likely to complain about Rebus's numerous demands.<br /><br />It turns out that Ronnie was a threat to some people; Tracy knows more than she's telling; and Edinburgh's upper crust citizens have dark secrets. Some side plots in the story involve illegal dog fights, a gay character, and Rebus's ex-lover - Gillian Templer - who has a new radio DJ boyfriend. Rebus pines for Gillian and wants her back.<br /><br />The book gets over-convoluted and some plot points don't make sense. Still, Rebus has good intuition and identifies the criminals in the end.<br /><br />This is an early book in the Rebus series and he's kind of 'Rebus light.'

{"rating": 2, "title": "Disappointing historical fiction read", "text": "I could not get into any type of good reading groove with this one. The beginning was confusing to the point in which I had to read the publisher's synopsis to figure out what was even going on. Then a little bit of the backstory is introduced about the two sisters and I start getting my hopes up. But that was short lived and I just never felt fully invested in the characters or the story. I think this is a case of a book just not being the right fit for me.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1912 and from my understanding of the Author's Note this book is a work of fiction but the writer did draw some inspiration from real life events and people. This book can be placed in the historical fiction genre but much of it is the product of the author's creativity and imagination. Thea and Kay are half-sisters and there is a bit of an age gap between the two of them. After their father died, Thea put her plans of marriage on hold to relocate and raise her younger sister. Now ten years later, Thea is recently married to the captain of the Morning Light ship. The newlyweds and Kay set off for a lengthy voyage.<br /><br />I felt like I was able to better understand after reading the Author's Note what she was going for in the book and I appreciate the attempt to bring something different to the historical fiction genre. Unfortunately I had a hard time with the actual execution and had a bit of a choppy reading experience. Early on I felt like it was setup for me to care about the two sisters, but ultimately I just didn't, especially in regards to Kay.<br /><br />Judging by some of the other early reviews, either the story hits home with you or it is a complete miss.

His concern grows when he discovers she has been using an online dating site to meet men, and a full-scale investigation by Craddock and his deputy Maria Trevino ensues. Then another middle-aged woman disappears in a neighboring town under similar circumstances. With all of this going on, Craddock does NOT need the distraction of trying to referee a challenge to the local Catholic  church\u2019s control of the popular annual goat rodeo by the new Baptist minister.<br />After the reader is introduced to the issues the chief faces, the book turns into a fairly straightforward police procedural made more interesting by the glimpses of small-town life and characters. I was almost immediately put off, though, by the way the character of Craddock was portrayed. He comes across as quite the country bumpkin, who has almost no idea what online dating is about and does not even know enough to Google to find information.  He is not a Millennial, by any means, but he was police chief previously and then a successful businessman in the oil field before returning to Jarrett Creek. It is not believable to me that he would not have more expertise with computers than is described. To strain credibility further, this same man then sits down at Loretta\u2019s computer and looks at the history of her searches before she disappeared. Where did that more sophisticated expertise come from? He is not much more believable when it comes to police procedure. When he comes out of his house and sees that someone has apparently broken into Loretta\u2019s house, he runs to the house without apparently taking his gun. And when the police from a neighboring town tell him another woman has disappeared, he does not even think to ask the woman\u2019s name (nor does the other police officer think to give it to him).<br />After this it was not surprising to me that the denouement came from left field and had some big unexplained aspects to it, including just how Loretta was captured and successfully held captive.<br />I had read the first book in this series and enjoyed the atmosphere of the small Texas town. It was easy to pick up the context---it was no surprise that Samuel Craddock is now chief of police, and I think this is a series that readers need not read in order. If you enjoy small-town atmosphere and are not too picky about flaws in plot or character, you might like to visit the folks of Jarrett Creek, Texas.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Doesn't Gallop, Canter or Trot", "text": "\"The Yonnahlossee Riding Camp for Girls,\" Anton Disclafani's debut novel could have been much more impressive if it had engaged the reader with more of a sharp bit between the teeth persistence in its opening 100 pages.  Instead of packing a walloping punch, immediately exploring main character Thea's fall from grace, Disclafani relies on a gentler more meandering telling, using a \"girl and their ponies\" technique that seems innocuous but hides a sad and willful maturity that almost coldly defines her adolescent's natural fifteen-year-old self-absorption.<br /><br />Told in the first person, \"RIding Camp\" voices the first person experience of Thea Atwell after she is banished by her family-Florida citrus growers during the Depression Era to atone for her sins at an equestrian camp for girls, an odd punishment for someone who simply adores horses.<br /><br />Perhaps, as we learn that Thea and her brother Sam are virtually isolated, prowling about their 1000 acre property without supervision or any other society, Thea's \"imprisonment\" at the school/camp entails that she adjust quickly to the company of girls her own age, if not of her own social standing. No longer is she the reigning queen of her domain.<br /><br />The author takes her time, describing the camp and its inhabitants with the kind of stereotypical detail a young fifteen year old might use to categorize her competition.  Unfortunately for this reviewer, the overly lush depictions of the camp and its denizens although nicely accomplished from its adolescent vantage point fail to kindle enough interest to keep me thoroughly absorbed. Even though I could not wait to discover the big secret, the everyday activities of camp/school life did little to entertain me along the way.  The eventual reveal presents an event already guessed; the narrator defined as someone to which I do not wish to relate whose actions I cannot condone.<br /><br />What Disclafani achieves is a perfect portrait of an amoral young girl from her own part juvenile, part world weary perspective which, as it should, bounds about to eventually disclose the entire story from the priority standpoint of a fifteen year old.  Nevertheless, the ultimate effect it elicits for me is one of apathy, despite the wonderful prose, and the flawed untrustworthy main character.<br /><br />For some reason--perhaps the blurb promising this book to be the \"read of the summer,\" elevated my expectations to the standard of Donna Tartt's [[ASIN:1400031702 The Secret History]], another novel of secrets and boarding schools.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Those reading \"The Yonahlossee Riding Camp For Girls\" should add a star if they spent their own adolescence riding and loving horses.  For those who have not, this coming-of-age tale does not engage as rapidly as it should despite the lovely descriptions and depictions of the usual suspects in a boarding-school scenario.  Thea, the main character, is complex but not altogether likable which makes recommending this novel iffy at most.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\"reneofc\"", "images": [], "asin": "1594486409", "parent_asin": "1594486409", "user_id": "AHMSKOYKE32N5P6E7AK7PQXGPA7A", "timestamp": 1370309954000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Making Sounds for the Movies", "text": "It is sometimes said that sound makes up half a movie or video. I'm not certain what the proportions are, but Kahra Scott-James and I agree that sound can make or break a moving image.<br /><br />This book begins with a history of the use of sound in movies and videos, including experimental works. Scott-James then proceeds to discuss the use of sound before, during and after production. Her examination is of the process involved rather than on the techniques of creating sound, with a major emphasis upon animation (which has significant differences from the live action process). The milieu she looks at is major productions that can afford producers, directors, cinematographers, and with regard to sound, sound designers, composers, editors, mixers and so forth. Nothing is aimed at the lone wolf videographer, although a few ideas can be derived from the multi-staffed productions.<br /><br />The book does not go into technical details, like how to mic a performer or operate a digital audio workstation, but that's not surprising. Given the wide variety of equipment that's available for both recording and editing, the reader should only expect to get that kind of information in a dedicated book. On the other hand, it would have been nice to have further exploration of what I consider the aesthetic aspects of sound; for example, what levels of detail in the sound matrix might best support a particular genre. (I've seen few texts that actually do this, and then only in the most general way. The aesthetic aspects seem to require a critique of actual work rather than a lesson.)<br /><br />There is a companion website, although the URL given only yields an error. I had to search the publisher's web site, using the author's name, to find the page. Ultimately, it mostly provided the names of a few full-length motion pictures recommended by the author. It's too bad the companion site wasn't full of clips that could have played sound and video to make the author's points.<br /><br />The book is aimed primarily at narrative fiction, with little mention of documentary or other types of filmmaking. The history of sound in movies and video was much longer then needed and seemed more like a separate academic treatise.  Picking a nit, the book had many long quotes of a kind usually indicated by set-ins or a different typeface that could only be distinguished from the main text by a citation at the end.<br /><br />If one has never read a book on the process of creating sound for movies or video this book will do.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Taliesin", "text": "I really like Arthurian legends.  And this one was supposed to be a good one.  In some ways it was, and in other ways I did not enjoy the book at all.<br /><br />This goes way back in the Arthurian legends to tell the tale of Merlin's parents.  The beautiful strong Charis of Atlantis.  And Taliesin, the enchanting druid bard who is son of a king.  The book divides its time between the two and their families, telling of their early years.  For Charis, this is the start of a war for her nation, her time spent as a bull dancer, and the fall of Atlantis.  For Taliesin, his tale shows the meeting of his parents, his training as a druid, and how he meets Charis.  Charis especially meets with a lot of hardship and her story is the more interesting of the two.  Taliesin seems to live a charmed life and is thought of as lucky and fortune favored.<br /><br />The characters were well written.  They had a lot of depth to them and Lawhead took the time to give them a full history.  Charis is written as cold but capable.  Taliesin is charming.  There are many other characters that are all essential to the book.  My only complaint about the characters is that Lawhead made the Christians perfect in action and the pagans somewhat evil at times.  It was a little disconcerting to find that in what I thought was a fantasy novel rather than a religious work.<br /><br />Lawhead is very descriptive.  He gives an engaging plot and does a wonderful fantasy telling of the earlier parts in the Arthurian legends.  He makes his characters mostly believable and especially in Charis' case, you want to know what is going to happen to them and care about them as a character.  Nothing is overtly offensive in the wording and there isn't a lot of harsh language.<br /><br />Let me touch on some criticisms however.  As stated before Christianity is considered very good in this book.  Lawhead took it to the point where it felt very preachy to me.  I don't care that a writer reflects his religion in his works, but please don't announce it as the be all end all of religion because that can be offensive to some readers with different beliefs.  In this Arthurian legend especially, where a lot of paganism is involved, it is very disconcerting to read a book that expresses the beliefs this way instead of being a fabulous work of fantasy.  Also, for the purists who read this, the timeline seems a bit strange.  For most, Atlantis takes place hundreds if not thousands of years before the time of Arthur and even though this is a couple generations back from Arthur, it still seems to be too close.  There are some other historical data that doesn't quite sync up with normal Arthurian tales as well.  While it is a fantasy tale, there are some genres like the Arthurian legends, where are you taking a risk by deviating well accepted norms within the genre.  I think Lawhead dances a very fine dance on the line with these aspects.  Overall though, these things brought the book down a bit for me and really were a disappointment.<br /><br />I have the next book in the series so I will be continuing on.  I can only hope they improve and become less preachy and truer to the Arthurian legend.<br /><br />Taliesin<br />Copyright 1987<br />452 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Good story about cops vs. a sociopathic serial killer", "text": "In this fourth book in the series, Detective Chief Inspector Erika Foster's big mouth and abrasive attitude have got her booted off Lewisham's Murder Investigation Team (MIT) and stuck with a boring desk job. When the horribly battered body of a half-naked young woman is found in a London dumpster, Erika - on her own initiative - connects the killing to another murder a few months before. Desperate to get back on the MIT and investigate the appalling crimes, Erika is willing to do almost anything - even apologize to her nemesis, Superintendent Sparks.<br /><br />Before long Erika is the Senior Investigative Officer in the cases of the murdered girls, working with her usual team, including Peterson, Moss, and Crane. Erika thinks a serial killer is at work, and she's proven right when a third body turns up in a dumpster. The top brass at Scotland Yard, fearing bad publicity and public backlash, put pressure on Erika to catch the perp - but budget constraints limit the resources assigned to her.<br /><br />We learn that the killer is a short, pudgy office worker who resents the fact that attractive women won't look at him twice. Wanting revenge against women, the killer repeatedly creates fake profiles on social media to 'catfish' a pretty brunette and lure her into meeting him. He then kidnaps, cages, tortures, and murders the victim. When a not-so-attractive woman - the perp's awkward co-worker - invites him to a movie, he can barely stand to be with her.....which is pretty ironic.<br /><br />The story alternates between the police investigation and the killer's activities. The description of the perp's step-by-step method of tracking, luring, and torturing his victims ratchet up the tension, and I had to take periodic breaks from the book. I hate the killer, despise his parents (a dismissive father and weak mother), and I'm not crazy about his dog, Grendel (though she doesn't know any better).<br /><br />On the other hand, I admire the hard-working, dedicated detectives, who work day and night to stop the murderer and hopefully rescue a fourth victim. Erika is still experiencing angst about her cop husband who was killed in the line of duty, but a burgeoning relationship between Erika and Peterson may signal better times ahead.<br /><br />The story held my attention and I was anxious to see how things played out. It was also interesting to see how the detectives discover clues, make deductions, and track down the killer. My one quibble: books that feature cops vs. a sociopathic serial killer are pretty common, and the story has a familiar ring.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend the book to people who like thrillers, especially fans of Erika Foster.<br /><br />Thanks to Netgalley, the author (Robert Bryndza) and the publisher (Bookouture) for a copy of the book.", "images": [], "asin": "B06VY6NMZ3", "parent_asin": "B06VY6NMZ3", "user_id": "AHNZRQNJHNSBVKERNXSWNLKOZ6YQ", "timestamp": 1494556977000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Reunited with her brother Sam, the world is slightly less terrible than it was before.

I was expecting Ben, Cassie, and Evan as the main focus and for a few chunks of the book they were, those parts kept me interested. In fact, I loved the parts with Cassie as the narrator, because everyone else made it seem like she was stupid or complaining all the time. Ben made me mad this time. He was obviously in serious need of medical attention the entire book, but continued to push himself, which I think will certainly hurt him in the next book. Even Evan's part made me interested! We got to see more into the lives of the Others and it really shows just how different he is from the rest of them. But why, why, and I can't stress this enough...WHY was there not more of the romance between Evan and Cassie like there was in the first book? I love that so much. Overall, I think this would have been a 4 or maybe even a 5...if there wasn't the POV of Ringer in there.

I had never heard of Stuart Woods, though I do often read and enjoy mysteries.<br /><br />I want to compare my experience with \"Short Straw\" with my readying \"Brass Verdict\" or \"The Lincoln Lawyer\" by Michael Connelly. The lead character of both authors is a lone-wolf lawyer. Both lead characters have had failed relationships. That's about the only similarity, other than that both lawyers face uncertainty, hazard, and adventure in the journeys of their stories.<br /><br />Connelly's characters are human. They express fear, concern, hope, despair. Those of Woods express nothing. Occasionally the stress of a situation causes them to vomit; then Woods' story continues. The characters in \"Short Straw\" interact for often-unknown reasons, but they never have relationships or display reasons for what they do.<br /><br />But the story is pretty good. If you're not looking for characterization or scenic description in a novel, Woods writes well. There is no mystery to \"Short Straw.\" Early on, readers know who did what. The two reasons for reading the book are to find out how it ends, and I can't think of what the other one was. But, I enjoyed the story; I was pulled into the action.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not the Best Thing for Vampires Since the Blood Bank", "text": "I'm probably going to upset a lot of people.  I'm not disrecommending(what a dreadful word) this book.  It's better than a lot of fiction out there, but I didn't think this book was the best thing for vampires since the invention of the blood bank.  It's not bad, which is why I put my rating in the middle, but the plotting is definitely lackluster and the protagonists are too predictable.<br />What I liked-- the villains.  Rashad is far more interesting than the male protagonist.  A creature of wit, style and sentiment.  You wouldn't catch Rashad drinking himself into a stupor.  The villains are more complex than the protagonists, more three dimensional, and have the added fillip of doing bad things for a reason, not just being evil because the author needed some evil villains.<br />The concept of the Noble Dead.  I don't know if this is original with the authors or they picked it up somewhere, but it's a nice term that resonates with some of the other terms used to describe dangerous creatures that we don't want to offend.<br />The part I wasn't particularly interested in: First, the reader who doesn't know where the series is going is very new to vampire fiction.  The title gives that away.<br />Second the protagonists are ok but don't particularly compel interest:  Young female with a mysterious background who ran away from home at an early age with mystic items left for her by her missing father of significantly higher social status-- Young half elf who drinks to forget his tormented past (but we are told all about it 3/4 of the way through the book). The dream of the female half of this odd partnership is to settle down in a real home.<br />So they try to settle down and that's when things get really dangerous.<br />The quest is a mainstay of adventure stories but it has to shine hard and bright not soft and soggy as a stale cookie.

{"rating": 3, "title": "I Wanted to Like This Book Far More Than I Did", "text": "This review is of \u201cSavage Abandon\u201d by Rochelle Wayne.<br /><br />The book begins in 1854, in a Comanche Indian village afflicted with cholera. Among those afflicted is Lone Bear, a 12-year old child. His family leaves him due to die in the village to save themselves. He is found by two white men, Jacob McAllister, an Army scout, and Carl Morgan, a doctor. The two men nurse Lone Bear back to health, and Carl adopts him and takes him back to his home in Boston, renaming him Travis Morgan.<br /><br />Fast forward 18 years. Shelaine Evans, the heroine of the book, has come to Arizona to be with her father, Army major Robert Evans. (Robert and Shelaine\u2019s mother, Jennifer, were estranged over Robert\u2019s wish to remain in the Army in the west, as opposed to moving back east. Jennifer has since passed and now Shelaine is going to live with her father). Before she arrives, however, she nearly drowns trying to save a child from a carriage accident in a raging river. Shelaine is saved by an Indian named Tsalalute, whom she is immediately attracted to. She is heartbroken, however, to discover that Robert passed three days before she arrived. Shelaine then becomes the companion to a young woman, Diane Gardner, whose father, rancher Forrest Gardner, wants someone to teach Diane-who is a tomboy-to be a lady. (There\u2019s more to the story than that). Diane later falls in love with Tsalalute\u2019s friend, Daring Wolf. This creates problems with Diane and Forrest, as he has a deep hatred for Indians of any tribe.<br /><br />When Shelaine meets Tsalalute again, she sees him in a different way. This time, he is in his other guise, as Travis Morgan. They become lovers.<br />When Daring Wolf is captured and accused of staging raids, Lone Bear, as Travis, frees him. Afterward, Travis and Daring Wolf \u201ckidnap\u201d Diane and Shelaine. (Diane and Shelaine aren\u2019t entirely unwilling to go with them). Daring Wolf marries Diane, but Shelaine refuses to marry Travis. They argue over the reasons, as both assume untrue reasons why the other won\u2019t marry them. We also learn more about Lone Bear\u2019s history as Travis Morgan and about his mother, Little Doe. Shelaine and Lone Bear agree to marry as soon as he reunites with his mother and they can be married at an Army Fort.<br />Gardner wants Diane back-for reasons that have nothing to do with love-and posted a reward for her return. This encouraged a group of ruffians to try to take Diane and Shelaine out of the Comanche village; this effort doesn\u2019t succeed but a second attempt led by Gardner does. When he finds Diane and discovers she is pregnant with Daring Wolf\u2019s child, Gardner imprisons her in their home; he also hatches a sinister plan for her unborn child.<br /><br />Shelaine is kidnapped by a Comanche brave who is angry with all whites due to the fact that his wife was killed by Forrest when he entered the Comanche village where she had been, but wasn\u2019t at the time. Travis later frees Shelaine, they agree to marry, and they-as well as Diane and Daring Wolf-have their Happily Ever After.<br /><br />Upside: Ms Wayne is pretty much at her typical writing style here, and that\u2019s a good thing. She produces likeable characters in Shelaine and Travis, and few authors of her time spent more time on their supporting characters than Ms. Wayne did.<br /><br />Downside: I didn\u2019t find Shelaine or Travis to be that deep, especially Shelaine (her entire backstory is told in chapter 1, and from there, the focus is on where she is in the current phase of the book. They also aren\u2019t particularly dynamic characters who can carry the lead of a book. Neither, for that matter, are Diane and Daring Wolf. It\u2019s never explained exactly why Forrest Gardner hates Indians with such passion.<br /><br />In every one of Ms. Wayne\u2019s books, a female character finds herself in peril and needing to be saved by a male character. Those who read my reviews know how I feel on this subject, so I won\u2019t repeat those views here.<br /><br />There are plenty of scenes in \u201cSavage Abandon\u201d which have high emotion potential. Ms. Wayne doesn\u2019t bring out those emotions, however.<br /><br />Sex: Multiple sex scenes. Most are fairly mild.<br /><br />Violence: Attempted rape, assault and battery, shootings. None of the violence is graphic.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A pleasant book, but had the potential to be much more.", "images": [], "asin": "0821715054", "parent_asin": "0821715054", "user_id": "AF57ERGRF5IBJURVL5SOCCEVU7IQ", "timestamp": 1565222226389, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Lovely writing, but read like a debate", "text": "\"The only way to understand such evil is to reimagine it. And, as Goya knew, the only way to reimagine it is through art.\"<br /><br />In this novel, D. Clements Olin -- born in Poland, raised in America, now a scholar specializing in \"survivor texts\" -- is in the midst of a book project on writer Tadeusz Borowski, who memorialized his experiences at Auschwitz and, tragically, committed suicide six years after liberation. To better understand writers like Borowski, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Primo Levi, Olin joins a spiritual retreat convened on the grounds of Auschwitz.<br /><br />It's a very short novel; the pages fly with lovely language and descriptions that put the reader at Auschwitz. But I found myself letting the book sit, rather than picking it up to read. To make a comparison: I may be one of few people who didn't like the film, [[ASIN:B000TXP56C Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]; it seemed more a series of dry philosophical debates than a story. Well, this book felt very much the same. As in the quote above, Matthiessen felt he needed to write it as fiction, but it reads like an essay. Its group of stereotypical (and mostly unlikeable) characters just debate a series of heated topics, among them whether Germans should feel guilt; whether Jews were passive and co-responsible; whether there's any place for Holocaust commerce (art, literature, tourism). Emotion comes into the book through two sub-plots, but one left me unsatisfied and the other annoyed me.<br /><br />I liked the language enough that I'll likely try an earlier novel by Matthiessen. If you do decide to read this one, I recommend doing so in as close to a single sitting as possible.", "images": [], "asin": "1594633177", "parent_asin": "1594633177", "user_id": "AELWJW4LXVDRX4FXV3ALUSUPA4OQ", "timestamp": 1400025226000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

This is the first book I've read in the \"cozy mystery\" genre, and everything about it was just a bit too cute for my taste. Much of the plot was highly improbable. The basic plot involves tea shop owner Theodosia Browning trying to figure out why a local orchid aficionado dropped dead immediately after winning a rare specimen at an orchid auction. There's not much else to say about the plot, so I'll get on to the elements I found unbelievable or troublesome. First, the prose is chock-full of description that seems to serve little purpose. Second, there's really no character development. The characters are entirely one-dimensional. Third, the elements of the story and completely implausible. What police chief allows a random civilian to drop off key evidence in a homicide investigation to him at her convenience? Finally, all the extraneous elements of the story are just a bit too perfect. Everything is the best and the nicest.- the nicest tea shop, the most popular bed and breakfast. The tea shop has an unflappable chef who can always make just the most perfect pastries. All this saccharine is more than a little tiresome.

{"rating": 3, "title": "It\u2019s also super fun to Google variations of the sentiment in order ...", "text": "The concept of fiction as a lie whose subtext is actually truth has been around for a long, long time. It\u2019s also super fun to Google variations of the sentiment in order to see how many quotes you can find that are variations of the tune:<br /><br />\u201cFiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.\u201d \u2013Albert Camus, author-<br /><br />\u201cArt is a lie that tells the truth.\u201d \u2013Pablo Picasso, painter-<br /><br />\u201cFiction reveals truth that reality obscures.\u201d \u2013Ralph Waldo Emerson, poet-<br /><br />\u201cTruth is stranger than fiction, judgie wudgie.\u201d \u2013Curly, Stooge-<br /><br />It\u2019s one of those witticisms that\u2019d likely be labeled a clich&eacute; if it weren\u2019t so matter-of-factly true for so many people who dabble in fiction. Authors have a tendency to write what they know. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Jo Walton personally knew a bunch of fairies at one point or another in the course of her life, but there is a subtext to her imaginings that are likely pinned on a lived and/or learned experience. Fiction is often an extreme elaboration for something gnawing away at writer. Fahrenheit 451, for example, was about the destruction of books and ideas. It wasn\u2019t that Bradbury was quaking in his boots at the thought of suppressive fascism, as it is often thought, but was a cry in the dark by a man who fiercely loathed television and believed it was a machine that made people much dumber than they ought to be, and kept them from reading.<br /><br />Also, Jo Walton is the kind of person that will use a word like \u201caxiomatically\u201d in the opening line of her acknowledgements. It\u2019s only fair to allow her the pretension of her claim that the fairies were real. Of course the fairies were real. Any reader worth his or her salt accepts axiomatically the reality of fairies.<br /><br />But allow me to dial back the harsh nature of my criticisms. Jo Walton claims the reality of fairies for two reasons, 1) because she is selling herself as an author of imaginative whimsy, and it\u2019s a good line to leave off on, and 2) she is really implying the virtues of imagination, which can have as much worth as any old bit of reality.<br /><br />About half way through the book is a passage about dolls that encapsulates the wonderful, tangible reality of imagination and the banality of the real:<br /><br />\u201cThe problem with Rosebud and her really talking was that our other dolls could pretend talk, and that was better. Our collection of dolls\u2026had epic adventures surviving after nuclear wars or rescuing dragons from evil princesses. Battered old Pippa, with her one arm and her ragged hair\u2026could stand there vowing defiance and revenge against the evil Dog Overlord\u2026and Rosebud couldn\u2019t compete when all she could say was \u201cLet\u2019s play schoo-ul.\u201d (pg. 159-160)<br /><br />Rosebud the doll is meant to emulate the really real world. Notice, too, that the doll not only represents bland reality, but implores children to \u201cplay schoo-ul,\u201d which is far from what most children want to be bothered with.<br /><br />Reality is for suckers, and that\u2019s definitely something I accept axiomatically.<br /><br />Now, I know that this review is a bit sarcasm-heavy, but I would be lying if I tried to tell you that it wasn\u2019t beautifully written. I can make that concession, though I cannot claim to be the audience for this particular story.

Percy, himself a tobacco farmer, and the association work to break the economic monopoly exerted by the big tobacco companies (those bastards were evil well before they started lying to the public about the addictive nature of their deadly products). But when legal and ethical means are not enough, the collective leadership starts down a slippery slope of coercing nonassociation members to join or else face the consequences. Bands of \"night riders\" fan out across countryside, first destroying the crops of those who refused their entreaties to join up, then property, until even the taking of human life is justified as a means to their end once they have made the decision to torch the tobacco warehouses in Bardsville and the other towns in the vicinity.<br />Percy Munn finds himself at the center, and as other men whom he admired peel off from The Association because their moral bearing will not allow their continued participation, Percy eventually finds himself cut off from his wife; men such as Capt. Todd whom he greatly admired; Lucille Christian, the woman who tries to save him from himself; and eventually the leaders of The Association who let him take a fall for something he did not do.<br />The story is properly characterized as a tragedy even though Percy Munn is not as noble a central figure as one might expect. His great weakness is that he attaches himself to causes without much thought of the consequences. In other words, he is an idealist, but a flawed one. Though Percy's fall is in part caused by his flaws, a series of betrayals---sometimes he is the betrayer and other times he is betrayed---also conspire against him. When loyalty becomes more a currency than a principal, tragedy is inevitable.<br />Robert Penn Warren captures the speech and mannerisms of this main characters effectively, but he does not develop three-dimensional characters, with the exception of Willie Proudfit, the hard-scrabble, nearly destitute farmer who is something of a mystic who lives life fully and with a fervor Perse cannot experience as he continues his spiral inward. The landscape and settings seem more like those rendered by wood cuttings rather than a photograph. Some of Robert Penn Warren's digressions meander for pages without bolstering the story, and at times the allegorical and naturalistic elements of the novel seem at war with one another.<br />If permitted, I might rate this novel three and a half stars. Reading Night Rider is a worthwhile book for wintertime reading, butit is not the finest work by the author who was to become the first Poet Laureate of the United States.", "images": [], "asin": "1879941147", "parent_asin": "1879941147", "user_id": "AG6M46M6UWHX2LM7XTCOOPK25NKQ", "timestamp": 1014764102000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "A real page turner.", "text": "The Charm School opens with a young American tourist, Gregory Fisher, driving in the Soviet Union's countryside in the 1980s. He makes an \"illegal\" stop to do some sightseeing and come across an American POW, recently escaped from a secret KGB training school where they force over 300 American POW's to teach Russians to think, act, and talk like Americans. There's no way Fisher could take the man with him to Moscow without them both being caught. Fisher calls the US Embassy as soon as he gets to his hotel and tells them what the man told him, but the KGB gets to Fisher before the  US Embassy can.<br /><br />Sam Hollis and Lisa Rhodes are the two diplomats who took the call. The Soviets insist that Fisher never checked into his hotel and in fact never reached Moscow, but was killed in when his car missed a turn and went off the road. Sam and Lisa volunteer to go retrieve the body in a ruse to get near the Charm School. They end up killing two guards and fleeing from the KGB after meeting Commander Burov, who unbeknownst to them is in charge of the school.<br /><br />The story action slows down now but you get a good picture of life in the Soviet Union, and also of life in an embassy. Though many of the Russian peasants don't agree with their government, they are powerless to do anything about it.  The government is basically ruling by terror - there is no such thing as a fair trial in the Soviet Union. You read how the common man lives day by day, paycheck to paycheck. The houses are run down, buildings are dilapidated, and the quality of life is very poor compared with Western standards. People will wait for hours in lines for fresh milk.<br /><br />We are introduced to a Soviet officer who has given Sam Hollis much inside information. He offers Sam a list of over 3,000 names of Russians who have gone through the Charm School and are now living in America, in key positions in exchange for safe passage to the West for he and his granddaughter.<br /><br />Sam and Lisa are soon declared persona non gratis by the Soviet Union and must leave. Predictably, their plane is grounded by a mysterious bomb threat and they are transferred to a Soviet Military helicopter where they are taken to the Charm School and given two choices - become instructors or be tortured and shot.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will say that though at times the book was predictable (though still enjoyable), the ending caught me completely by surprise and was perhaps a little sad.<br />This book is definitely a thriller. The beginning of the book kept you on the seat of your pants to find out what happens next, and the last two hundred pages or so were constant page turners.  The only thing I didn't like, as with all Nelson DeMille novels, was the frequent foul language and the occasional sex scene, which really doesn't add anything to the story at all. That's why I only gave it 3 stars.", "images": [], "asin": "0446353205", "parent_asin": "0446353205", "user_id": "AEEDKA7C4JSH27N73YL5X7PGTMFA", "timestamp": 1210869843000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "No Dignity For Lynne's Last Days", "text": "Lynne\u2019s Last Christmas- A Battle With Dementia was just heart breaking to read. I was friends with Lynne when we met at a Westgate Doll Show back in 1980. If you knew the real Lynne, as I did, you would never write about her most torturous end of her life. Lynne was very private, hiding behind a perfect front that she had to put on every day. Just knowing that these horrific moments of her end, would be shared with others, would make her beyond sad forever.<br /><br />Lynne and I were a month apart, and when we went to our doll shows or meetings, we had such fun. She told me, this was the only place she could be herself, without having to be the perfect wife, perfect hostess, perfect daughter or perfect mother. She was so sad about life\u2019s problems and imperfections, as she only wanted everything perfect, like the person she forced herself to be. Lynne shared with me all the things in life, that she just couldn\u2019t cope with- having rats in her beautiful  home on Wooster coming up through every opening in the home, due to Rocky River\u2019s sewer issues with rats. She would call me up crying, that she opened her kitchen drawer and there were dead rats in her kitchen towels. Then she dealt with her beloved son going through cancer and the thought of him not getting well took up all her energy. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, her husband was going to leave her for one of his co-workers. Lynne\u2019s perfect exterior couldn\u2019t cope with real life and this took her mentally down. She told me divorce was out of the question, being the perfect Catholic.<br /><br />Lynne loved our Barbie Doings at The Bain Cabin and at each other\u2019s homes. Whenever it was her turn to have us over at her home, she told me, Don wouldn\u2019t approve, as all our entertaining is for his or our friends, not mine. She lived a life for others, never for herself. She loved being the perfect mom more than anything. I often wonder if any of her family ever knew the real Lynne that I knew, imperfect, frightened of everything. The book itself would make Lynne eternally sad to hang all her dirty laundry out for everyone to see. Her image of perfection was what she lived for. Lynne was so proud of her cooking skills, and I can still see her eating her famous potato salad at our Barbie meeting at the Bain Cabin. How she loved the compliments. Lynne was a very fragile, wonderful, fun friend whose perfect exterior hid the frightened little girl inside. I truly wish this book was written without her name attached to it, as she deserves way better. A 3 STAR book with no dignity for Lynne\u2019s last days.", "images": [], "asin": "1790751403", "parent_asin": "1790751403", "user_id": "AENQC6O3X4BUEQWSDTBUN2VMM5VQ", "timestamp": 1610430861461, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not Completely Grounded", "text": "\"No hobby cases, Harry.\"<br /><br />That's the message from Cliff O'Toole, the new lieutenant heading up the Open-Unsolved Unit. O'Toole thinks Bosch is overly fixated on a murder case that started during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, twenty years ago.<br /><br />Says O'Toole: \"You are the worst kind of police officer, Bosch. You are arrogant, you are a bully, and you think the laws and regulations simply don't apply to you. I'm not the first to attempt to rid this department of you. But I will be the last.\"<br /><br />Bosch, of course, put the T in tenacious and he'll even go ahead and take a `vacation' to pursue a lead. Harry Bosch has a bullet casing--a bullet casing found near the body of a female photojournalist who was murdered in an alley and now, given the intervening two decades, Bosch can put it under more scrutiny with new technology at his disposal. And he has personal motivation. Bosch had been one of the cops to find the body during the riots.<br /><br />Bosch struggles for space and freedom to pursue his instincts against the grain of police bureaucracy. Bosch follows every single scrap of evidence like the master sleuth we admire, blowing through apparent dead ends and seeing things that others have not.<br /><br />Bosch is pursuing the \"one thing that brings it all together and makes sense of things. You find it and you're gold.\"<br /><br />For the most part, \"The Black Box\" works. Bosch follows the victim's past and starts making links to a moment on a cruise ship that was used for R & R for soldiers in the Gulf War.<br /><br />For me, several things didn't quite click. I didn't think O'Toole's anger at Bosch was warranted. Bosch's alleged crimes within department rules seemed relatively minor. Yes, he wandered slightly outside of protocol, but his steps didn't seem to justify putting a fellow cop out on the street to trail Bosch--a cop who plays a critical role in coming to Bosch's aid at the end. And once Bosch follows his leads up to central California, I had the feeling that Connelly wanted Harry Bosch to teach Jack Reacher a thing or two about toughness and guile. The Hollywood-esque ending felt a bit over-the-top.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is one of the best at breaking down a case, figuring things out, asking questions, pursuing every angle and, of course, never giving up. He's also a rogue cop, albeit a rogue with heart. \"The Black Box\" is a good read but I wish the climax had its feet as firmly on the ground as the first four-fifths of the story.", "images": [], "asin": "0316069434", "parent_asin": "0316069434", "user_id": "AEYFCXNFRVL5ISYTH7AO2CZH4WZQ", "timestamp": 1355666178000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "What took him so long?", "text": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK!<br />This is an interesting book.  I enjoyed reading it because it chronicles one of America's greatest music groups, and shows what went on behind the scenes of that perfection machine known as The Eagles.  Granted, that inside glimpse comes from Felder's perspective, but it is the only expose` I have read that shines some light on the dysfunction within this group.<br /><br />Felder tells of his humble beginnings in Gainesville, Florida; his growing love of music; the sibling rivalry caused by being compared to his brother; and his own reckless behavior that caused a long-lasting rift with his parents.<br /><br />He was complimentary of his fellow band-mates, quick to give praise to the musicians who helped him get his start in the music industry.  He even admitted to his personal failings while touring on the road.  It is not every man who can stand up and tell the world that he drank, did drugs and cheated on his wife.  One thing came through clearly and repeatedly as he told his story, Don Felder did love his wife Susan and their four children. Having said that, I wondered about Felder's cavalier attitude in explaining away his behavior.<br /><br />It was mildly annoying that when speaking of Don Henley and Glenn Frye, they were always referred to as \"The Gods.\"  I found it self-aggrandizing that Felder constantly patted himself on the back for his accomplishments; but this is, after all, his biography.  It was difficult to read about his emotional weakness at the time Henley and Frey ended his partnership with the Eagles.<br /><br />The manner in which Felder informed his wife that their marriage was over was disturbing. The fact that he found a girlfriend before either he or his wife had filed for divorce, was more than a minor character flaw.  I will always love the music of the Eagles. I have Felder's album \"Airborne,\" and I think he is a gifted musician; but this book truly changed my opinion of Don Felder the man.<br /><br />The reader never gets to the truth behind the title of the book until it nears its conclusion, by then I asked myself what took him so long.", "images": [], "asin": "0470450428", "parent_asin": "0470450428", "user_id": "AHNVHDN7XDCNRF7GZTDNLSABU5OQ", "timestamp": 1283113914000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Author Hunter borrows and invents words like \"Mentat\" and \"I-filters\" to describe mundane, everyday concepts. Mentat is taken from Frank Herberts \"Dune\": a Mentat is essentially a human computer. The bottom line is that we rely on others to help us in reaching decisions and - surprise - those others may not have our best interests at heart and may, in fact, be using our \"secrets\", like our music preferences, to influence our decisions.<br /><br />  This is not news.<br /><br />  Hunter not only likes movies, he draws life lessons from them. There are dozens of references to movies in this book.<br /><br />  Hunter has a few schmaltzy rules that he has created, like \"When everything is known, no one knows everything.\" Ponder that. But don't expect to get paid for it.<br /><br />  Ultimately this wandering book of nostrums, recycled newspaper stories and references to Hollywood movies as sources of wisdom comes down to a muffled sales pitch for Gartner, \"the world's largest technology research firm.\" \"Lots of systems administrators aren't taking these basic steps now, and that's a prime reason why their systems get cracked.\" But fear not is the implied message, Gartner can help save you! \"Any credible vulnerability assessment will find two out of three Web servers connected to the Internet are vulnerable to simple attacks that can ar least result in changing the contenrt of the Web server,\" my Gartner colleague said . . .

Yet this historical fiction of the people of the North American continent caught my imagination and provided grist for the mill in a recent presentation I made on the origins of consciousness.  A very well written story with detail of the lives of our ancient ancestors and how we might have lived, evolved, and dreamed. It is refreshing to have a shared hero and heroine, with the story of how our patriarchal society might have also evolved from the life of hunter-gatherers.<br />The Gears bring their considerable knowledge to bare in the weaving of this intriguing story of our heritage. It is obvious that they have paid attention to the details and are trying to put together the most plausible explanation of how life might have been in the transition from the last ice age. The people live in clans and are dependent upon each other for survival. They struggled for leadership just as any other group of humans and fought over the viability for the best ideas of survival. They fought change, they tried hard to maintain their contact with the spiritual side of existence and they were deeply respectful of life.<br />We follow the mammoth hunters as they struggle for survival during the stress of &quot;others&quot; forcing them from their normal hunting grounds and camps. They struggle with the balance of peaceful coexistence and warring to protect the life they know. And then they face the incredible challenge of going against all their accumulated knowledge to follow Wolf Dreamer under the ice to a new land.

From missed emails to wrong clothes. From the get-go, Kim is being tempted to quit and take the easy road and has been given many opportunities to bow out. However, Kim is determined to prove those who have ridiculed her wrong and that she is ready to spread god's word to those who need to hear it.

{"rating": 2, "title": "California weird approach to organization", "text": "Liz Franklin bills herself as a \"Cubicle Anthropologist\". She strikes me as just another Californian with a weird approach to a simple topic: keeping clutter out of your life.<br /><br />  Franklin calls herself a humorist - and there is what appears to be a definite attempt to emulate the late Erma Bombeck and the still-very-much-alive Scott Adams. But it is a poor imitation of both.<br /><br />  Franklin makes up her own categories for people: \"sparklebrains\", \"linears\" and \"cross-dominants\", each of whom gets their own symbol. Then she divides them into \"spatials\", \"visuals\" and \"chronologicals\", each of which style also gets its own symbol. Simple, isn't it? This explains why you live in a clutter.<br /><br />  However, the space ship needs to make a stop to explain \"synesthesia\", people who associate words, objects and events with sounds, colors and smells. They can see vowels glow or smell words. If real, very, very few people have this trait, but like a child with a new grown-up word, Franklin spends pages on synthesetes. She even includes a test with questions like \"[h]ow does a three smell?\" and \"[w]hat flavor is June?\".<br /><br />  When Franklin returns from orbit, she gets to the real business: handling paperwork. Yes: paperwork. Though the book was published in 2003, Franklin doesn't touch the subject of electronic data. Weird.<br /><br />  Silliness abounds. Franklin tries to be brilliant, so she offers advice like \"verbing\" your tasks. Don't use nouns, use verbs. Of course, Franklin begins this section with a mistake: she fails to recognize that (at one time) \"Xerox\" was often used as a verb in addition to being used as a noun. She trumpets her great discovery: \"Changing nouns to verbs is one of the secret tricks to making paper flow smoothly. The old nouns we used kept things in the past; now verbs move them into the future. Verbs are what motivate us to get things done.\" So just get into the habit of \"verbing\" everything and life will be fine. You bet. And don't forget to put things in verbed and non-verbed stacks!<br /><br />  Franklin is big on what strike me as juvenile word games. For example, \"soonering\" your to-dos is a way to get things done on time. If you have something due on the 15th, \"sooner\" your to-do for an earlier date so you'll have time to do the work. I am not joking: this is in the book.<br /><br />  Overall, I found this book silly. There is, of course, the pitch for Franklin to come in and organize your life.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Good start", "text": "I hoped to really like this; my favorite kind of non-fiction is a history that takes something about which the received wisdom is rather straightforward and shows how much more complex it is. Books I have praised in other reviews, \"Dark Horse\" and \"Big Trouble\" described some small and obscure events in such a way as to astonish and delight. If I ever have to whittle my library down to 10 books, these two will remain.<br /><br />Not so \"Dead Last.\" Part of the problem is that Harding just wasn't an impressive guy. Genial, kindly and nondescript, he seems to have been a fellow who got along and wanted to do well for his town, his state and his country. But he had some character flaws that made him a poor judge of character and he allowed his desire for young, pretty women to get the better of him. The country that came to train tracks to watch his coffin ride by was, just a few months later, done with him. Bumbling Warren, tumbled to the bottom of the list.<br /><br />But the question is not how, but why? Why did an era that worshiped sex and money and alcohol, exemplified by the blazing couple of the 20s, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, so despise WGH? Was it merely that they didn't like the idea of old people sharing their fun? Was there more? Was it the intelligentsia's abhorrence of the small town boosterish middle class? Or his not using the \"best minds\" which has been such a recurring theme in leftist politics for a century? This was an era of a frenzied press seeking to sell papers, so stories of seedy assignations would be front page news. And spiritualism was everywhere as well; even Coolidge tried to communicate with his dead son. These were big ingredients in the 20s stew, but were never addressed. Just too much context was not captured to explain how he fell so far so fast.<br /><br />In reading much history it has always seemed to me the historical categories are defined not by any stark lines but by deciding first whom we want in and then writing our categories to fit those preconceptions. Well, we want Kennedy to be a glorious President, so we have to carefully define what he did as great and blow off the things that don't fit. (Rape? Really? You can be a rapist and pimp and be a great President?) Likewise, stuffy, stodgy Harding, opposed to the Progressive agenda, must be a bad guy, so historians, not seeking truth but seeking vindication, labor diligently to fit him into this department. And the one word line, serial philanderer and leader of thieves, is all anyone needs to know.<br /><br />Now Harding made it easy, but historians want big men who try big things, and they become great,. Wilson. Roosevelt one and two. Kennedy. Johnson. And the scowling meanies like Nixon can never become great, because they are on the bad team. Nothing Nixon did could ever vindicate him, nothing Kennedy did could ever tarnish him. (I fear we may be in a similar situation today, with historians working as hard as Pravda ever did to apologize for and excuse their man.)<br /><br />This \"Why\" is an interesting question, one I wish had been explored here, but was not. And so the author wanders all over (in rather doggy prose) discussing how Marion and Florence and his friends tried to protect Harding's reputation and in doing so allowed it to sink even further.

The plot may have seemed a bit convoluted and possibly a bit coincidental until the story truly found its direction. But the jokes were there, and so was the entertainment value, and so was the group of pranksters that staggered across the page. For starters, there was the cross-dressing absentee father figure, the nude model with the fair skin and feminine charms, the slaphappy artist with a slightly questionable work ethic and talent, and that\u2019s just in the first half of the story.<br /><br />It was always a bit of a guess as to what would happen next, so if you like being turned upside down and shaken around a bit, then this novel might hold as much promise as spiked Kool-Aid.

But it suffers from what I see as some of the characteristics that make reading a Shaara book such a chore...it is huge at over 600 pages and would have benefited from being reduced to half that length, and the cast of characters is equally huge. It has the usual mix of real people (Sherman, Joe Johnson) and the fictional in the person of the enslaved Franklin. It gave a fairly balanced look at Sherman, who continues to be a byword in the South to this day for many. All one need do is to access any Civil War website, particularly on Facebook, and you will read claims that Sherman, or at least some of his men, did everything except eat a baby...As a descendant of Union veterans, including one great grand uncle who marched with Sherman, I have a different view. I actually think Shaara did a good job of threading the needle between Sherman as hero and Sherman as monster. But, the book was such a long slog that I gave up about half way through and skimmed to the end.

Many of these are minor stories by name authors; see TOC link at first comment. One suspects the anthology was published so editor Mohan could pay the authors something. There are a few standout stories:<br /><br />* \"The Gauze Banner\", by Eleanor Arnason<br />A wry, amusing Hwarhath tale, never reprinted per ISFDB. Nominated for the 1998 Tiptree Award.  Worth seeking out, if you're an Arnason fan. And you should be  ;-]<br /><br />* \"The Experiment\", as by SN Dyer (Sharon N. Farber). Dark humor about two f-ckups in Vietnam, drafted into an LSD experiment back in the World. Entertaining but slight.<br /><br />* \"Visitors\", by Laurie A. Taylor.  Post-apocalypse visitors to a partially-functional automatic house, &agrave; la \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" by Ray Bradbury. Nice story;  grim, plausible ending.<br /><br />* \"Hardware Scenario G-49\" (1991), by James Alan Gardner. George, a kindly hardware-store manager, meets Diana, Goddess of the Hunt. Hijinks ensue. This is a  variant on the [[ASIN:1447403355 The Night Life of the Gods]] schtick, but the story that immediately came to mind  was Keith Roberts' wonderful \"Ariadne Potts\". Not quite in that class, but pretty darn good. This, the second of four reprints in the book, was also reprinted  in Gardner's 2005 Gravity Wells collection.<br /><br />* \"Unchosen Love\" (1994), a Hainish story by Ursula K. Le Guin. This well-received story was nominated for three major awards, and has been reprinted three times, most recently in a third edition of The Birthday of the World and Other Stories (2010).

However I am hoping it would be helpful to other readers and ultimately the author for me to say a few things about this book.<br />First I read a lot of historical fiction. It is one of my favorite genres. I have read little about France and was interested in this story. The very first chapter threw me off as it contains french words that I could not define (despite trying). As a result I did not know what was being said.<br />Chapter two was much easier and not so much use of French words. I actually got very interested in the story and read like crazy at that point. Then at about 23% or so you lost me again with lots of French words and dialogue that it was sometimes hard to tell who was talking to whom.<br />It's obviously well researched and the author is knowledgeable but it just lacks the ability for fairly simple digestion by the reader. The story line is interesting but my reading time is little and very precious to me. When I found myself bored I had to ask myself if I was willing to experience another few hundred pages of this.

Finally it was on Amazon for sale, so I eagerly bought it and consumed it within 24 hours.<br /><br />I read it, disgusted the whole time, with my lip curling. Once I yelled loudly \"I hate him!\" This is NOT romance, love, or even lust. This is abuse. Many times Rhydon hurts Sallie by grabbing her wrists, and \"crushing\" her with kisses. What made me the most angry was how manipulative he was, how mocking, sneering and uncaring he was towards her. Yet she always puts up with it and surrenders to him so fast, it's maddening.<br /><br />He takes away everything she loves, grounds her from traveling and doing her job, basically pinning her in, and she knows it! She just succumbs to it. No career anymore? No excitement? No problem!<br /><br />Not only that, but several times he tells her to \"shut up!\" and calls her a fool. Several times she knows she's in danger because of his temper, the look in his eyes, and he threatens her many times, even threatening her that he knows a lot of people and she'll never work in this town again! Does that sound like love or romance to you? She barely makes a whimper when he takes everything away from her!<br /><br />I shudder to think what kind of young girl I was 30 years ago that thought this was an excellent book.

I never heard of Vanishing Twin Syndrome until today and learned something new yet again!<br />This character shines with her faith and despite tragic circumstances, finds the will to go on. Beth is not perfect by all means but I sympathized all heartily with her reactions particularly as she deals with her mother's lack of sensitivity.<br />Beth' strength, her determination to survive and to find joy around her, her willingness to forgive makes her beautiful, a true Christian.<br /><br />On the other end, you have Suzanne, her mother. She too is hit by tragic circumstances beyond her control, but has little faith and is emotionally dependent on others.<br />I think I disliked this character from the moment she denied comfort to her daughter, thinking instead of her own need. It does not stop there either and I found myself hard put to be charitable.<br />Despite my wish to be fair and not to judge, I found myself wondering how a mother could simply walk out on her child and use emotional baggage to justify her attitude.<br /><br />Perhaps the plot line was to effectively balance the weakness and the strength in both main protagonists, highlighting Christian compassion and forgiveness as shown in sub characters as well.<br /><br />My feelings were however ambivalent and in the end, I wish I could have cut the book in two and made it just Beth's story...<br /><br />3 Stars.<br /><br />Thank you to Christina and Sherrie for the gift of the Ebook!

{"rating": 2, "title": "This historic opus of horrors is dull and boring", "text": "This historic opus of horrors is dull and boring, despite the subversive and gruesome subject matter. Admittedly, the S&M scenes ARE still often stomach-turning and blasphemous; however, the author writes in an inventive style of his own which, frankly, puts each scene on the page with such nebulous and confusingly unique grammar that it makes the reading of this 'classic' a chore (originally written in French, there are four English translations - I liked this one best of the two I read). However, although individual sentences often sing with glory, even in translation, and some particular nightmarish descriptions of the narrator's activities have apparently sent generations of readers into ecstatic creative productions of Surreal Art, the only reason for anyone to attempt reading this book would be out of curiosity or for a Literature class. It is strictly a 'History of the Novel' read.<br /><br />If googled, there is a lot of expert guessing about the author and his purpose in writing this unique book - was it transformed from real events or was it all imagination? The horror stories we see now every day on cable television, with vivid graphic gore commonplace and accessible to us sitting in our living-rooms would only be known to Ducasse either through conversation, pictures, books or having seen or done something similar in real life, in my opinion. I think this book is the work of a juvenile, or perhaps a schizophrenic, mind - intelligent and educated, but juvenile, a young man playing at being a 19th-century male goth; or he was simply unable to control the fantasies and images which may have been assaulting him. I think it is possible the author actually did some of these things (in a manner with no fantasy elements) or saw them done. Heavy use of alcohol-drugs give a schizophrenic or psychotic madness to thoughts and dreams, too. I was sure that the author had to be in bad health when he wrote this; when I read his bio (what there is), apparently it may have been as bad as I guessed - even if he only starved to death from Napoleon's war - but I suspect he was diseased as well. Syphilis, perhaps? In any case, he died at age 24.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />&#34;&#34;Ducasse was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, to Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, a French consular officer, and his wife Jacquette-C\u00e9lestine Davezac. Very little is known about Isidore's childhood, except that he was baptized on 16 November 1847 in the cathedral of Montevideo and that his mother died soon afterwards, probably due to an epidemic. In 1851, as a five-year-old, he experienced the end of the eight-year Siege of Montevideo in the Argentine-Uruguayan War. He was brought up to speak three languages: French, Spanish and English.<br /><br />In October 1859, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to high school in France by his father. He was trained in French education and technology at the Imperial Lyc\u00e9e in Tarbes. In 1863 he enrolled in the Lyc\u00e9e Louis Barthou in Pau, where he attended classes in rhetoric and philosophy (under and uppergreat). He excelled at arithmetic and drawing and showed extravagance in his thinking and style. Isidore was a reader of Edgar Allan Poe and particularly favored Percy Bysshe Shelley and Byron, as well as Adam Mickiewicz, Milton, Robert Southey, Alfred de Musset and Baudelaire. During school he was fascinated by Racine and Corneille, and by the scene of the blinding in Sophocles' Oedipus the King. According to his schoolmate Paul Lesp\u00e8s, he displayed obvious folly &#34;by self-indulgent use of adjectives and an accumulation of terrible death images&#34; in an essay. After graduation he lived in Tarbes, where he started a friendship with Georges Dazet, the son of his guardian, and decided to become a writer.<br /><br />After a brief stay with his father in Montevideo, Ducasse settled in Paris at the end of 1867. He began studies at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, only to abandon them one year later. Continuous allowances from his father made it possible for Ducasse to dedicate himself completely to his writing. He lived in the &#34;Intellectual Quarter&#34;, in a hotel in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, where he worked intensely on the first canto of Les Chants de Maldoror. It is possible that he started this work before his passage to Montevideo, and also continued the work during his ocean journey.<br /><br />Ducasse was a frequent visitor to nearby libraries, where he read Romantic literature, as well as scientific works and encyclopaedias. The publisher L\u00e9on Genonceaux described him as a &#34;large, dark, young man, beardless, mercurial, neat and industrious&#34;, and reported that Ducasse wrote &#34;only at night, sitting at his piano, declaiming wildly while striking the keys, and hammering out ever new verses to the sounds&#34;.<br /><br />In late 1868, Ducasse published (anonymously and at his own expense) the first canto of Les Chants de Maldoror a booklet of thirty-two pages which is considered by many to be a bold, taboo-defying poem concerning pain and cruelty.&#34;&#34;<br /><br />The above information is from the following Wikipedia article: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comte_...<br /><br />The historical record explains this book enchanted many artists who later read this book. Presto! The Surrealist Movement was born!<br />The below quote from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Surrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont, and for the line &#34;beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella&#34;, and Arthur Rimbaud, two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.&#34;<br /><br />Many Literature readers and literary critics of ancient Canon Great Books love these intelligent, talented, drugged-out alcoholic, usually male (millennia of prejudice meant women were often forbidden to read anything but their religious books, if they could read at all) writers of genius whose real lifestyle invariably involves abuse of wives and children and prostitutes, while living in decrepit attics with filth on the floors-walls and insects crawling on them in their stupefied sleep, starving from having spent whatever cash they had on alcohol/drugs. Some of these authors ARE very good, and worthy of being respected as great writers (if not family guys), but others seem to have become totally psychotic and took up a pen while blitzed or having an episode of mental derangement. The world of mostly male Literature experts applaud wildly and buys every copy printed. Is it of value? Reluctantly, I say yes. At worst we females gain insight to the male mind. At best, some really wonderful books are written.<br /><br />But this isn't one of those.<br /><br />I think Ducasse appropriated the style of writing from the Revelations book in the Bible, but he wrote from a Lucifer follower's viewpoint, and placed his nightmarish scenes (dreams?) in his contemporary Paris, along with including particularly revolting religious imagery with the idea perhaps of creatively and satirically attempting to toss writing conventions (particularly in the grammar rules which identify the subject, i.e. 'I, you, me, they', so that there is a struggle by the reader to understand which narrator is speaking) and social mores of decency out the window. I understand the intellectual point of this. I can imagine the shock of a 19th century reader. However, for a 21st century reader, this book is a tremendous bore. I think there are lots of satirical transformations of other authors' philosophical writings and stories included (I saw references on the Net from experts who say that Ducasse stole entire sections of material, verbatim, from other books of the time.", "images": [], "asin": "0982046480", "parent_asin": "0982046480", "user_id": "AH35PYPHPOU3AZKZPC46ANU7NAGA", "timestamp": 1429953047000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Which, of course, is the main reason people would flock to so called \"evidence\" of \"intelligent design\".<br /><br />Darwin had the same initial reservations about his theory as most creationists have had ever since, but, he also dispelled them in a chapter written just for that purpose. You can go through his thought process with him as you read it. T. H. Huxley reportedly exclaimed \"How stupid not to have thought of it!\" in his excitement of reading it (he was Darwin's \"bulldog\" there after).<br /><br />Most, of the faithful, probably, don't get around to actually studying evolution. If they did, they'd likely have to admit that it certainly is very rational. And NOT as so many love to proclaim: \"random\", full of missing \"intermediates\", and artless.<br /><br />Most modern disbelievers fire their cannons all over the place hoping that some of the shot will stick. One of the main objections is always this idea that evolutionists believe that life originated \"randomly\".<br /><br />Natural Selection is anything BUT random (though, not in need of supernatural forces either!). It accumulates over time - hardly difficult to understand. But, if you fear evolution - like so many faithful do, you're not likely to accept it anyway. :)<br /><br />Other fine books to look at are Dawkin's the Blind Watchmaker, and his recent missive the God Delusion.<br />Whether or not you believe, deny, or are on the boarder, the arguments are worth being aware of.<br /><br />As for this book, it's unnecessary. The God bias is clear, and the arguments OLD.<br /><br />Lastly, most creationists no matter their faith, assume that if they can SINK natural selection with some \"magic bullet\" that creationism will be the next obvious choice for how living organisms came about. They ridiculously imagine that there's only Natural selection and God as explanations.<br /><br />However, there are endless other less supernatural and MORE supernatural explanations than the faithful can begin to dispel.

Although there were a few times where I cracked a smile, I found the flow of the story to be difficult to follow and the humor felt forced and often crude in nature.\u00a0 \u00a0But, as a whole, the story was quite imaginative and unique in the way it was presented to the listener.\u00a0 It must have taken some time for the author to create all the various quips, puns, and pokes for the various events you will experience in the book.<br /><br />I liked that the author included many of the known fantasy tropes such as troll and even maintained their known weakness against such things as fire.\u00a0 He seemed quite knowledgeable in fantasy works.\u00a0 A few of the creatures were unique while others were what one expects generally to find in a book of this category.\u00a0 I enjoyed the scene with the gelatinous cube as I have myself faced such a creature in my own role-playing adventures.\u00a0 The characters themselves I found to be rather non-dimensional and flat.\u00a0 I understand that in a book consisting of only journal entries, you will not have a lot of narrative or backstory to fill in these important details.\u00a0 What you do learn of the main character, the author of the journal, is that he is quite the outlaw with very few morals.\u00a0 He is a rather selfish character who is always looking out for number one, even during battles.\u00a0 The audiobook has promise, I would have liked to have had more depth and complexity than simply all humor; understanding this was a piece of satire.<br /><br />The audiobook\u2019s narration was well done with only a few noticeable audio artifacts; mainly swallowing which was not edited out.\u00a0 Nothing that would prevent you from listening though.\u00a0 The volume of the book was consistent from the start to finish, and I do not recall any other issues with the audio itself.\u00a0 The narrator\u2019s voice was believable as the main character and even the other characters he voiced along the way.\u00a0 I look forward to hearing future narrated books to see if they are as well performed.<br /><br />For parents and younger readers, as the author himself says, the book is really intended to be listened to by adults.\u00a0 Yet, some of the gaming and fantasy humor will be picked up by younger readers, I think much of it will be over their heads.\u00a0 As stated earlier, some of the humor is rather crude and may not be suitable for younger readers.<br /><br />In summary, I liked the short chapters (journal entries) as it made consuming the book easier when large blocks of time could not be set aside for listening.\u00a0 I really wish this was told more in a traditional story with more depth and character development than it was.\u00a0 I think one can still have a fair amount of humor and satire told in a story more than the numerous journal entries.\u00a0 I do have to give the author credit for thinking outside the box and attempting to tell the story in this way.<br /><br />Audiobook was provided for review by the author.<br /><br />Please find this complete review and many others at my review blog.<br /><br />[If this review helped, please press YES.

Jill has some bruises and Lindsay asks her about them, but is brushed off with an explanation that she was caught in the shower door.  Lindsay doesn\u2019t buy it, but after Jill has gone, Lindsay sees a beautiful, expensive townhouse explode.  The townhouse was owned by Morton Lightower, a businessman who supposedly cheated his investors out of millions of dollars.  Lindsay rescues a young boy from the home, but the parents are dead, and a group that calls themselves August Spies takes responsibility for the murders.  The au pair is missing, and also the family\u2019s baby, so Lindsay not only is investigating a murder, but also a kidnapping.  A few days later, a businessman who is responsible for cutting the insurance coverage of thousands of poor people, is murdered by ricin; again August Spies.  Cindy Thomas, another member of the Women\u2019s murder club, receives an email from August Spies, and she becomes involved in the investigation with Lindsay.  As more murders occur, there is panic in the city, and there is pressure to solve the crimes and find August Spies.<br /><br />During the course of the novel, there are issues with Jill, her husband, and the bruises; Lindsay meets Joe Molinari, a big wig in the FBI who lives in Washington.  Not only is there chemistry, but Joe becomes Lindsay\u2019s love interest in this and subsequent novels.  These sub-plots add interest to the novel, but there is suspense during Lindsay\u2019s investigation, since she and others are in danger, and as the investigation continues and she becomes closer to finding the real murderer.  The investigation becomes personal as a member of the murder club becomes a victim.  The other members are devastated and work together to find clues as more murders are occurring in the form of bombings and poisonings.<br /><br />The Women\u2019s Murder Club series is a little lighter than James Patterson\u2019s mainstream novels; they are simply written, easy to follow, and very quick.  Although there are murders, the descriptions of them are not as graphic or violent as in the novels written strictly by James Patterson.  The Women\u2019s Murder Club series is more about fun, mindless reading than about weaving characters through researched details and real or historical scenarios.  Readers who are fans of Lindsay, Jill, Cindy, and Claire will enjoy this third installment; it\u2019s fun to follow their personal lives, and they almost seem like real acquaintances.

MIles accepted the order, an employee who was grateful for the opportunities he received in life from Ford, but was embittered.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Full of Mystery and Fright", "text": "Twelve-year-old Victoria Wright believes in perfection. Being top of her class isn\u2019t just an achievement, it\u2019s her right. Her best friend Lawrence Prewitt is nothing like her. Easily distracted by his piano and unable to remember to tuck in his shirt, Lawrence would be a lost cause without her. Then one day without warning Lawrence disappears. Victoria is baffled, especially when the people of Belleville don\u2019t seem as concerned by his disappearance as she is. When Victoria\u2019s investigation leads her to the mysterious Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls, she\u2019ll discover just what goes on behind its closed doors and that being perfect comes at a price.<br /><br />Claire Legrand\u2019s The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls is full of mystery and fright. Told from the view point of the ambitious Victoria, Legrand\u2019s book is a lesson in individuality, that being different is more valuable than being perfect. Belleville is a pristine town, where following the rules is imperative, and anyone who deviates from the norm is labeled strange. But Victoria discovers stranger things still when she begins to notices several children missing and something off about the perfect smiles of the adults around her. Victoria receives several perplexing warnings to be careful, but instead of being the perfect example of good behavior, something she\u2019s extremely good at, Victoria is determined to find her friend even if it means breaking the rules.<br /><br />Victoria is at first awe-struck by Mrs. Cavendish, who runs the Home for Boys and Girls. She is lovely, kind, and for some reason thoughts get a little fuzzy in Victoria\u2019s head when she\u2019s around her. Mrs. Cavendish is also a perfectionist and though it terrifies Victoria to think so, for there is something evil hiding behind that pretty smile, she is a lot like her. One thing I missed from this book was the presence of adults, aside from the villains. Victoria\u2019s parents have little to do than to present perfect personas that convince me they are the reason for Victoria\u2019s unrealistic expectations of herself and others. And when the mystery of the missing children is finally resolved, little seems to have changed for the adults in the story.<br /><br />I also couldn\u2019t quite grasp why Lawrence\u2019s musical gift would be looked down upon, but perhaps this is my own biases speaking. I would have liked the book to have set up his and Victoria\u2019s friendship more before his disappearance. We are told that part of Victoria\u2019s disapproval of Lawrence lies not only in her desire for everyone to care about school and rules like she does, but also because she is a little jealous. I would have liked to have seen this rather than being told. The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls is a fun quick read that has a lot of elements similar to Neil Gaiman\u2019s Coraline, but lacked enough distinction to really pull me in entirely.", "images": [], "asin": "1442442921", "parent_asin": "1442442921", "user_id": "AERQG2U5GKGCRVI2VVHK5DQZO3ZQ", "timestamp": 1427813982000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 3, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "Reads like a Bob Goff memoir. A great book idea with poor execution and little biblical support.", "text": "So many people rave about this book. I don\u2019t. But maybe you should still read it. The point of the book is to spur us on to love all people, all the time. While I personally had some issues with the book, if reading this will help you love others better, then don\u2019t let me stand in the way! And to his credit, Bob Goff is funny and a great storyteller, and I truly believe he loves the Lord and is doing a lot to help people and love on them. I cannot criticize him for lack of effort!<br /><br />So what was the problem? After each time I read part of this book, I came away thinking \u2018I need to be more like Bob Goff\u2019 or \u2018Man, I\u2019m never gonna be like Bob Goff.\u2019 And it\u2019s not about Bob Goff!! It\u2019s about being more like Jesus and loving like Jesus. It read more like a memoir of Bob Goff\u2019s life than a biblical book on looking like Jesus.<br /><br />We constantly hear the message \u2018Love others\u2019 or \u2018love your neighbor\u2019, etc. And I\u2019ve been struggling to figure out what EXACTLY that means. How do I, in my life, do this better? What does it mean to love? Can I still be loving someone if others don\u2019t feel like I am? Bob Goff did not answer these questions for me. A lot of the stories he tells, as other reviewers have observed as well, are not relatable to me in where I live and what I have access to. I can\u2019t send people to Disneyland. I can\u2019t fly back and forth to Uganda a bunch of times. I'm not going to let a homeless man hang out in my minivan during the day in between carting my children around. The practicality was not there. And maybe I\u2019m looking for answers that just aren\u2019t going to be cut and dry, and that\u2019s something I need to sit back and consider. But either way, this book does not take you by the hand and help you identify ways you can make a difference in your community. It overwhelms you with grandeur and paralyzes you into feelings of inadequacy.<br /><br />A lot of his stories seemed irresponsible. No Bob, don't go flying your little plane through this very risky place just for the heck of it- get those groceries back to your wife! The writing was a lot of disjointed stories peppered with a few lines of \u2018profound\u2019 analogy that most times didn\u2019t connect for me. I kept thinking, \u2018Wait, what point is he trying to make??'<br /><br />I also had issues with the way Bob did and did not talk about the Bible. I believe Bob has a high view of Scripture, and granted, a lot of the things he said, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t MEAN it that way, but perception is reality, and I wish he would have taken more care with his words. With every quote from the book below, I\u2019m sure he could explain further how it\u2019s not what I think, but here are my thoughts:<br /><br />\u201c[God is saying] \u2018You got this. You know enough.\u2019 \u201d<br />Um.. no\u2026? I think God would tell us \u2018I got this\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m enough.\u2019<br /><br />\u201c[Jesus] demonstrated the word with is much bigger and worthier and more accessible than any ten Bible verses.\u201d<br />I\u2019m thinking he maybe meant something like actions speak louder than words, but I don\u2019t think he has the authority to tell us what word is worthier than God\u2019s very Word.<br /><br />\u201cThere\u2019s a verse that says 'Do not despise these small beginnings'. I love that.\u201d<br />He gives no biblical reference and no context. It\u2019s an obscure verse in Zephaniah (I looked it up) and I\u2019m not entirely sure if he used it properly. And then says \u201cHe already believes in me, just as much as He knows the outcome. He already believes in you too. He\u2019s so confident we already know what to do next that He\u2019s willing to be silent even when we ask for His voice.\u201d I don\u2019t think we need God to believe in us. It\u2019s not about us. And He is not silent because he\u2019s confident in our ability to discern right and wrong. I don\u2019t think we can begin to explain why God is silent.<br /><br />[Talking about Ananias and Sapphira] \u201cSo why did they drop dead? I don\u2019t think anyone knows for sure\u2026They had probably said what they hoped to do so often they actually thought they had done it.\u201d<br />Um. Again, no, Bob. For one, he likes to talk about the Bible and say \u2018We don\u2019t know, but I think [insert either a bad idea or something that\u2019s already widely known]\u2019. For two, I\u2019m pretty sure they knew exactly what they were doing. They didn\u2019t want to give away all their money. And they didn\u2019t want to tell people that. It\u2019s that simple.<br /><br />\u201cHe continues to be with us\u2026He\u2019s sent us books about Him and has included a lot of letters, and He\u2019s sent us friends too.\u201d<br />And, also, Bob Goff, he sent HIS SPIRIT. Missed opportunity to talk about a pretty significant thing.<br /><br />\u201cWhen we draw a circle around the whole world like grace did and say everybody is in, God\u2019s love gives us bigger identities that we used to have.\u201d<br />And later he talked about the thief on the cross with Jesus, that Jesus didn\u2019t give him a quiz, he just said, \u2018You\u2019re in.\u2019 A little reminiscent of Rob Bell. God\u2019s grace is sufficient for all but not effective for all. Jesus didn\u2019t save both thieves, he just saved the one. Of course, we don\u2019t know who God chooses to save, but Bob Goff\u2019s words infer some Love Wins theology, which is not biblically accurate.<br /><br />He likes to tell us what God is thinking. Which, obviously, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our domain. But even the few places where God lets us know what he\u2019s doing, I think Bob still gets it wrong.<br /><br />The intent of this book is great and important and relevant. But not much of the content fell into any of those categories for me. His humor and good storytelling didn't make up for the lack of strong biblical support and frankly, his arrogance. Like: he says they are teaching witch doctors to read using the Bible....and his own book. What?! Why not just use the Bible? He appears to be equating his words with God's words. And then he casually drops that he got to meet the president at the White House with the man he brought back from Uganda. That part was not relevant to the story; I think he just wanted us to know he got to go to the White House. And then there's the parts where he passed all these hard law exams on his first try, he holds his office somewhere that would require people to pay $100 just to talk to him, their family's private lodge, etc.<br /><br />I can't deny that this book DOES remind you to see people, listen to their stories, involve them in your life. And that is worth noting and keeping with you.<br /><br />I want to love everybody, always, but this book wasn't doing it for me. There was way too much Bob to sift through to get those few sentences of value.

{"rating": 1, "title": "The early material is great, but Niven's latest is awful", "text": "In 1966 Larry Niven created the ultimate tourist with his short story \"Neutron Star.\" It was the tale of Beowulf Shaeffer, a laid-off pilot heavily in debt and easy to blackmail, and how the alien race the puppeteers convinced him to make a dangerous flyby of a neutron star. Throughout the late sixties followed several other Beowulf Shaeffer stories, which were previously to be found only in the out-of-print collection NEUTRON STAR. In 1994 Del Rey released CRASHLANDER, which brought back into print the Beowulf Shaeffer stories of the late 60's, together with \"The Borderland of Sol\" (1975), a new story \"Procrustes,\" and interim material that Niven had just penned to bind the stories together into one novel, as it were (there's no table of contents and the title of each story isn't listed at the head of the page). CRASHLANDER has some good material, but the latest writing shows that Niven's treatment of his Known Space universe has become very poor indeed.<br />The late-60's Beowulf Shaeffer stories were classics of science fiction, mixing hard science with colourful alien races and futuristic fashion. In \"Neutron Star\" the reader travels with Shaeffer as he visits what was then a revolutionary concept in astronomy. In \"At the Core\", the puppeteers convince Shaeffer to take an experimental hyperdrive all the way to the galactic core, where he makes a discovery that spurs the puppeteers into fleeing Known Space. \"Flatlander\" begins with Shaeffer as a tourist on Earth, and takes him on a journey with a millionaire to a very unusual planet. \"Grendel\", the last of the golden age of the Shaeffer stories, has Shaeffer foil a kidnapping on a newly-colonized world. These stories are all excellent and are recommended reading for any fan of science fiction.<br />The last two stories, however, are incredibly disappointing, nearly enough so to taint the eariler works. \"The Borderland of Sol\" was written after the decline of Niven's writing in the mid-1970's. It nearly repeats the theme of \"Grendel\" (with Shaeffer becoming something of a detective), but with unbelievable characters, B-movie shoot-outs, and uninspired futurisms. The last story, \"Procrustes\" dates from the 1990's and is nearly as bad as Niven's novel from the same time THE RINGWORLD THRONE. \"Procrustes\" has a plot that is convoluted to say the least, and none of the characters act like they have in previous stories. Most disturbing is the Robert Heinlein-esque turn into sexuality explicit scenes that Niven made in the early 90's, as \"Procrustes\" begins with an orgy. The frame stories were written at the same time as \"Procrustes\" are are just as bad. They contradict previous Niven stories (such as mentioning the Trinocs when they won't be met for another 200 years, the Puppeteer Fleet of Worlds, etc.) and end in an inexplicable murder that is nothing but a deus-ex-machina.<br />My recommendation: skip CRASHLANDER and find the out-of-print collection NEUTRON STAR, which brings together all the golden age Shaeffer stories as well as several other fascinating Known Space short stories.", "images": [], "asin": "0345381688", "parent_asin": "0345381688", "user_id": "AHBGHXADI7434HJ2LECPDAIDKDDA", "timestamp": 1018451794000, "helpful_vote": 74, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it a enemies to love, or a pretending to date situation, neither quite applies. But this is a book where two characters who would likely have never given each other a chance all of their own accord were brought together by a twist of fate.<br /><br />Jess is single mom. Her daughter seems like a little Angel most of the time, but life hasn\u2019t been easy for Jess. She had her daughter right as she was finishing college and the father was never in picture. Jess has almost always lived with, or near, her grandparents. They raised her when her own mother walked away. They\u2019ve helped her raise her own daughter. Jess has a good job and good friends. She might like to have someone to love but she says she\u2019s too tired to date. She doesn\u2019t have enough hours in the day.<br /><br />River is just an acquaintance that Jess and her best friend Fizzy run into every day at their favorite coffee shop. They kind of think he\u2019s a jerk. He\u2019s always rushing, he doesn\u2019t talk to anyone and he only tips in change.<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed this book a little bit more if Jess and Fizzy\u2019s dislike of River wasn\u2019t so immediate and seemingly unfair. Based on their interactions in the coffee shop alone, I can\u2019t see any reason why they disliked him. He was just quiet and seemed like an introvert.<br /><br />One day, they find out that River is involved in the creation of a dating app that will help people find their soul mates. Basically, it takes (what Jess would consider) \u201cthe hard work\u201d out of it. You send in a spit sample and you can find people that could be your perfect match. They\u2019re also truly looking for committed relationships.<br /><br />Fizzy talks Jess into submitting her info on her 30th birthday. She\u2019s right to say that it seems like the perfect scenario for Jess.<br /><br />But something interesting happens. Jess matches with River at 98%. There\u2019s never been such a high match. At least for the sake of the company, River and Jess need to give things a try. Jess is reluctant, so the company offers her $10,000 a month to go on a few innocent dates with River.<br /><br />Being practically forced to spend time together, they realize that they do actually feel very connected to each other despite how different they seem. As it turns out, they actually aren\u2019t all that different.<br /><br />But given everything that had led up to their dating, it can\u2019t go perfectly smoothly, can it? It definitely felt like the other shoe was about to drop. And I was curious to find out what the challenge would be to their happiness.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story and appreciated the unique storyline. I\u2019ve enjoyed all of the authors\u2019 books but Holidate and Love and Other Conversations have definitely been my favorites so far, so I wanted to make sure my rating reflects that.<br /><br />I got to read an early ebook edition from NetGalley.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Some caution is required when drawing conclusions from the findings discussed in this book", "text": "The findings discussed in this book come from a wide variety of sources, ranging from scientific studies, to observed phenomena such as people coming together to get something done quickly with the help of technologies, and to anecdotes given to the author.<br /><br />While many of the findings indicate that technology does have positive and useful roles to play in people's lives, in some cases, it's not clear to me whether we can categorically assert that technology has made someone smarter.<br /><br />Take, for example, the observation that with the rise of software that can play chess with humans, and the increased opportunities for humans to gain chess playing knowledge and experience by playing against such software opponents, the age at which chess players are able to attain grandmastership status has also come down as well.  Can we categorically conclude from such a finding that competing against chess-playing software has a causal relationship to making someone a smarter chess player sooner, as evidenced by the younger ages of recently minted grandmasters (compared to the ages of grandmasters from decades ago)?  It seems to me there could be alternative explanations for such a finding.<br /><br />Or take the findings that technology can help improve our memory (i.e., remember things more readily or for a longer time).  While the ability to remember things is important to our ability to reason about things, memory improvements do not equate to, nor necessarily lead to, improvements in reasoning ability.<br /><br />Some of the findings discussed in this book do show, however, that well-designed computer games, for example, can be used effectively to hone children's reasoning abilities, at least with respect to some domains, as evidenced by test score differences.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is worth considering.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Solid, but ten years later, already feels stolid", "text": "\"The average electrician, air-conditioning mechanic, or burglar-alarm repairman lived a life that would have made the Sun King blink.\" (3) So opens this millennial survey of how wired, networked, and tangled American lives became circa 2000. Twenty years since Wolfe's last essay collection, this marks a more sober set of reflections on what now, ten years later, seems an optimistic start to what proved a dimmer decade.<br /><br />Wolfe argues, after the salacious \"hooking up\" of the sexy title takes but pp. 5-9 to elaborate, that science and academia, along with the media and consumers, connect in ways that allow affluence to rise and, unsurprisingly, intelligence to diminish for the norm. However, those in charge in Wolfe's world continue to wield power, and his fascination with the elite and how they clash with the proles makes this an engaging, if rather stolid, anthology.<br /><br />The first section, \"The Human Beast,\" examines the meeting of men with machines. Silicon Valley's birth comes with paralleling Josiah Grinnell, who took Horace Greeley's advice first-hand and went at least to the Middle West, of Iowa. His eponymous college schooled almost a century later Bob Noyce and classmates, who would spark the semiconductored, transistored post-WWII boom. This connects with an essay on E.O. Wilson's sociobiology, and while the pair move rapidly and neatly past everyone from Teilhard de Chardin to Nietzsche to Richard Dawkins, Wolfe manages to keep the material accessible. He sums up early Wilson: \"He was a skinny runt, and then for years after that he was a beanpole.\" (78)  Wolfe's prose style has calmed down, but he still keeps an eye out for telling details.<br /><br />On the other hand, other entries here feel already familiar. True, it's always fun to laugh at \"Rococo Marxists\" and the silliness of an art world that favors a pile of rust by Richard Serra over realistic figures crafted by Frederick Kirk. Of Kirk's rejection by the cognoscenti: \"Art worldlings regarded popularity as skill's live-in slut.\" (137) I agree with Wolfe in both critiques, but in his rush past \"The Great Relearning,\" the piece is too brief to do justice to the topic, and \"My Three Stooges\" in its lengthy explanation of his book tour for \"A Man in Full\" saps the essay before it gets around to the more valuable comparison and contrast of naturalistic fiction with film. \"Scene-by-scene construction\" and \"the liberal use of realistic dialogue\" share with film the novel's craft; \"interior point-of-view\" and \"the notation of status details,\" however, show the shortcomings of cinematic narrative. Wolfe defends his subject matter against the attacks of Mailer, Updike, and John Irving spiritedly, but when it comes to his own novella that follows, the interest for me lay more in the dialogue transcribing \"Florida Panhandle illiteracy\" and the way that two cameras can set up a sting operation and edit out dialogue than the actual plot of how a sleazy pair of operatives, one a manipulative schlub, one a blonde TV personality, pull off their set-up of three gay-bashing Army grunts who are suspected of killing a soldier at Fort Bragg, NC.<br /><br />Last comes the old Wolfe, a piece that he wrote about Wallace Shawn of the New Yorker despite the magazine's refusal to cooperate officially. Wolfe frames the article for \"New York\" magazine with a lively reminiscence of mid-60s journalism that recalls the sting operatives above. \"I'd heard of skeleton crews before, but this one was bones.\" (250) The original essay is fine, but for me any appeal lay in how the style that made Wolfe famous played off the more sober air of today's author.<br /><br />To sum up, after having read his previous journalism collections, this one finds Wolfe spanning his usual series of class studies, social critiques, and media send-ups. It's useful to capture the mood around the year 2000. But placed next to his groundbreaking New Journalism, it's a less combative, more unassuming stance.", "images": [], "asin": "0312420234", "parent_asin": "0312420234", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1264697447000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Lots of Action", "text": "If Trella thought the rebellion was hard, she had no idea that what came after would be just as difficult. The aftermath of a rebellion, the overthrowing of the current leadership, may get rid of problems but it also creates new ones. Leadership is still needed and determining that leadership can be tricky with different fractions having different beliefs and needs. Not everyone thinks things are better and getting the uppers and the scrubs to work together is going to take a lot more than simply changing who's in charge.<br /><br />Trella didn't want to be a leader but she found herself thrust into the role when friends old and new, needed help against the rulers of Inside. Now that the rebellion is over she's ready to go back to keeping to the shadows, or the ducts while continuing her relationship with Riley. Instead, she is still looked to for advice and assistance. Part of Trella's reluctance to get more involved and take a role as a leader in the new society is her lack of confidence in her decisions and her fear that she might cause injury or death to someone she cares about. She still feels guilt for the arrest and death of her good friend Cog. Trella's reluctance is accurate since prior to the rebellion, she kept to herself, having few friends and fewer allies.<br /><br />It doesn't matter what Trella wants, she finds herself right in the middle of what looks to be sabotage and is caught up in finding who is behind the destruction. This is when things begin to pick up. Prior to that, it was more of a recap of what happened in the first book, which is helpful if a bit slow. As Trella hits the ducts again discovering conspiracies and threats to her world, she begins to question who she can trust. Here's where we see again Trella's lack of confidence in her judgement. She's only 17 1/2 years old and was trained to clean the ducts not deal with political intrigue. I can see how she would begin to question everyone's motives but she stops trusting her instincts and trusting her instincts is one thing that the Trella from the first book did.<br /><br />The relationship between Trella and Riley goes through some rough times. I was surprised that we didn't see more of them working together since they meshed so well in the first book. Their romance is definitely a sub-plot so don't expect there to be much from that front. Trella is pulled in so many directions from her conflicts with Jacy and his gang, to Doctor Lamont, who may or may not be Trella's mother, to Bubba Boom and his crush on her, to Anne-Jade and Logan. There are a lot of distinct relationships that Trella finds herself in. None really had much depth and I didn't feel like I got to know any of the characters very well except for Trella.<br /><br />The pacing through most of the book is fairly quick with little down time. Trella jumps from one crisis to the next with a few stops for imprisonment and torture. There are some questions left from the first book that are answered here but there are also more questions brought to light with the threats that Trella and the other Insiders must face down. I look forward to seeing what comes next in this YA sci-fi series.", "images": [], "asin": "0373210116", "parent_asin": "0373210116", "user_id": "AHCRWHCVPY77C66P3BHYHU2V34QQ", "timestamp": 1316027041000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "Introduces traditions, displays imagery", "text": "This 1983 large-format book combines a Buddhist-infused commentary by Blanche Christine Olschak with photographs by Ursula Markus-Gansser and Augusto Gannser. The Swiss-based trio of scholars reports from the earlier stages of the kingdom's connections with the West, and the analysis is therefore very light on modernization, which had just begun in the period they visited. It can be perused in a sitting, as a quick introduction to the traditional mindset of the region.<br /><br />You do get a sense of the vast landscapes and mountain vistas. The photos of Lunana prove, as the text by Gansser underlines, the haunted quality of the far-off frontiers. Olschak's comments on the dances and rituals that dramatize Bon and Buddhist overlaps of stories and ideals also match the images effectively. What you won't get a sense of are the people themselves, in conversation or close-ups in the text. More from a distance, this shows the sights. It's brief, but fine for those who do not require an in-depth study of the realm.<br /><br />Chapters on the religious myths and culture (attending well to spiritual themes, as this book comes from Shambhala Press in English translation), the topography (lovely photos from remote areas and well as dzongs and folk artifacts), dance (good on symbolism), \"the coronation of the youngest king in the world\" in 1972, and a small overview of transitions into the wider world.

{"rating": 2, "title": "chalkboard analysis", "text": "This is a well-written, interesting book.  However, in my opinion, it tells only part of the story.  It looks at how Netscape formulated its strategy, but not at how (or whether) this strategy was executed.<br />This is like explaining a football game entirely on the basis of the diagrams  that the coaches drew on the chalkboard.  What actually happened on the  field gets no attention.<br />For example, the authors claim that one of  Netscape's strategies was to leverage Internet standards.  However, the  reality is that with its browser Netscape thumbed its nose at Internet  standards, particularly when it dominated the market.  Even today, its  browser generally is seen as less compliant with standards than is  Microsoft Explorer.<br />Another alleged Netscape strategy was to &quot;eat  your own dogfood,&quot; which means using your own products.  The reality  is quite different.  For example, Netscape released a production version of  Enterprise 3.0 and kept its own web site on Enterprise 2.0 for several  months afterward.<br />In 1996, a key component of Netscape's web server was  something they called LiveWire, which provided scripting and database  connectivity.  I adopted it for my web site in the second half of 1996.  However, after several months of trying to get it to work reliably, we had  to abandon it, moving to Java servlets instead.<br />Meanwhile, as of late  1997 (when I stopped following it), Netscape's web site still had not  adoped LiveWire.  They let other users suffer with the bugs and problems in  LiveWire, while they ran their own site using the older technology of  CGI/Perl.  That means they spent at least 1-1/2 years in real time  (multiply by 7x to get Internet time) NOT eating their own dogfood. In  contrast, Microsoft used their competing Active Server Page technology  immediately on their sites.<br />To return to the football analogy, my epitaph  for Netscape is that it is a company that told the press and its  shareholders that it was aiming to play in the Super Bowl, but disdained to  practice blocking and tackling.<br />While Netscape's executives were  formulating these nifty strategies, Sun and Microsoft were getting their  code in shape.

{"rating": 3, "title": "The Old Fox Deceiv'd by Martha Grimes: A review", "text": "Twelfth Night in the tiny Yorkshire fishing village of Rackmoor. It is a typically chilly and very foggy night with a North Sea wind blowing. The perfect night for murder.<br /><br />A young woman in costume apparently on her way to a Twelfth Night party at the local manor house is brutally murdered, her body left on steps on the way to the party. She was stabbed with some sort of two-pronged instrument. The police can't find the murder weapon or very many clues to what actually happened.<br /><br />Days later, when the trail has already grown cold, New Scotland Yard is called in and Inspector Richard Jury, along with his sidekick Wiggins, is assigned to the case. He's soon joined by his unofficial sidekick, Melrose Plant, who just happens to be a guest in that aforementioned manor house.<br /><br />There are many questions about the victim of the murder. First of all, her identity. Was she really Dillys March, the long-lost much-loved ward of Colonel Titus Crael, owner of the manor house? She certainly bore a remarkable resemblance to Dillys, but that wasn't the name she gave. Was she truly Gemma Temple, the name which she had used? What was she doing in Rackmoor?  Was she involved in some kind of scam in which she was trying to convince the Colonel that she was his ward so that she could share in his fortune? And, most of all, who stood to gain by her death?<br /><br />As Jury and his cohorts begin to pursue these questions, they uncover an unexpectedly tangled web that leads to other undiscovered murders. And, of course, it all has its roots in a decades-old maze of unrequited loves and unavenged wrongs in the village. The quiet, unassuming English village once again proves to be a very dangerous place.<br /><br />As in Martha Grimes' first entry in her Inspector Richard Jury series, which I just read earlier this week, we find that Rackmoor has its full complement of eccentric residents, several of whom have potential motives for murder and all of whom seem to have strong opinions about the murdered woman, as well as some of the tragedies of earlier years which have possibly led up to this particular murder.<br /><br />Two of the most sympathetic characters whom we meet in The Old Fox Deceiv'd are a young boy named Bertie and his dog Arnold. Both ultimately play a role in the unmasking of the murderer. Twelve-year-old Bertie has been left on his own by his mother who has gone off to London to pursue her dreams, which would only be impeded by the presence of an almost teenage son. Bertie and Arnold actually manage quite well without her. Bertie works part time and various people look in on him daily and make sure he has what he needs. The village takes care of its own. Who needs social services?<br /><br />Rackmoor does indeed seem to have been an idyllic place before those pesky murders intruded. Things are never quite what they seem though, are they?<br /><br />Again, Grimes has constructed a charming cozy mystery with quirky characters and plenty of gentle humor. Just the ticket for a summer day when it is too hot to do much of anything except sit in the shade with a cooling drink and read.", "images": [], "asin": "B00BHHDMQE", "parent_asin": "B00BHHDMQE", "user_id": "AGK6QUAZGDZSY4O5SVAVBPONX7PQ", "timestamp": 1405881259000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "A highwayscribery \"Book Report\"", "text": "One of the nice aspects to being sick, and there is a silver lining in just about anything, is that you, if so inclined, can get a lot of reading done. We're talking mildly sick here; sick so that you drift in and out of swoons induced by stuff you can buy over the counter. the scribe's Nyquil years are mostly behind him and reveries during this recent lay-up were fueled by Alka-Seltzer flu medicine, benadryl, and Vitamin-C powder packets.<br /><br />the highway scribe scarfed down a good number of books and reports on them will be spread out over the next few weeks. First to be finished off was \"The Muckrakers,\" which was edited back in 1961 by Arthur and Lila Weinberg.<br /><br />The tome contains actual writings of the famed muckrakers who wrote in the first decade of the last century. Their specialty was uncovering abuses. Those abuses could be committed by labor unions, or government officials, or a church, but mostly they worked to bust up the concentration of wealth as represented in the giant corporate trusts that had surfaced 20 or 30 years before.<br /><br />President Theodore Roosevelt termed the expression, \"muckrakers\" in a speech that was largely critical of the era's journalists who were, otherwise, mostly on his side, or at least shared the same goals of reform and a cleaner running system.<br /><br />Among the offerings in \"The Muckrakers\" is the very speech in which Roosevelt coined the expression. He drew it from Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\" and \"the description of the Man with the Muckrake, the man who could look no way but downward, with a muckrake in his hands; who was offered a celestial crown, but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor.\"<br /><br />TR went on to preach caution to those leading the crusade and called for an even-handedness that would inform, but not inflame.<br /><br />As they say, the name stuck.<br /><br />The book spends some time on the atmosphere in which the muckrakers were born. It talks about the growth of mass circulation magazines such as \"McClures\" and \"Cosmopolitan\" that took it upon themselves to finance investigative reporters and publish their in-depth revelations to much scandle and positive affect.<br /><br />Each section (The City, The State, Pure Food, Child Labor, etc.) is framed with a perusal of the issue at the time, and of a profile on the writer who did the work. Among these names are Lincoln Steffens, Ida Tarbell, Ray Stannard Baker, Upton Sinclair, and Mark Sullivan.<br /><br />the scribe pulled the book for purposes related to his career as a journalist. It's good to know what pioneers like this did and why. But coming to this book is a little like sampling Elvis after being raised on Pink Floyd. You're not going to see the novelty in it; and from their novelty were the muckrakers' powers drawn.<br /><br />This kind of reporting is done today in any number of weeklies and monthly's on the right and left; \"Harpers,\" \"Atlantic Monthly,\" \"The New Republic,\" \"National Review,\" and so on. The techniques have hardly changed. This book is about how the groundwork was laid.<br /><br />What's better and more useful about this collection of magazine articles are the portraits they render of the country in that time. It is a raw powerhouse sprawling its industrial self across a giant and empty continent, mostly lawless, if very Christian.<br /><br />The essays connect the dots on how the great fortunes of the era - Frick, Vanderbilt, Morgan etc.- were built largely through the acquisition of what was supposedly the public trust. They tell the story of child labor to the tunes of millions across the southern textile belt. The muckrakers spun sturdy yarns of corrupt city machines and detailed even the battles for territory, or the love lives, of immigrant newsboys from the street.<br /><br />It is hard to tell whether such an era of excess and abuse of public trust is a reflection on our own times, or if times simply don't change; that for all our pomp and circumstance, being a thug pays best.<br /><br />There was a law back in those times, that prevented people from leaving government to lobby the same place he just worke.<br /><br />What happened to that?<br /><br />The work/slave conditions documented by William Hard and Edwin Marshall are not gone, just shipped overseas.<br /><br />You can be a television cameraman and be killed in Baghdad hotel by U.S. forces, or you can reveal the secrets of a seedy senate and be mysteriously assassinated like David Graham Phillips was for articles reproduced in \"The Muckrakers.\"<br /><br />Two pieces at the back of the book, \"De Kid Wot Works at Night,\" and \"The City of Chicago: A Study of the Great Immoralities,\" create a rather staggering portrait of the crazy town on the lake at the height of its power.<br /><br />This Chicago is teeming and active to the outskirts, a city created along mass industrial lines where the human element was something of an afterthought. The city's largest business is vice, providing cheap (as in money) girls and cheap beer to the great swathes of workerdom serving the meat industry, the railroad, the ironworks, shipping. The girls are innocents pruned from the immigrant class and their trafficking is handled out of a city police department.<br /><br />And for all that, the actions government took in response, the attention paid by the general population to the muckrackers' message, are far beyond anything we might to expect today in terms of reform. The ink-stained wretches do not tread upon the feet of corporate titans they way they did then. They will not impose the will of the state over industry. Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican when blacks voted Republican, did.<br /><br />And America listened to its muckrakers, rather than label them, and acted according to their recommendations. \"The Muckrakers\" as a book shows us what that interaction meant, and what has been lost between the press and its audience.", "images": [], "asin": "0252069862", "parent_asin": "0252069862", "user_id": "AFTIBR2KLZS32KMJ5SWEPD3JMD3A", "timestamp": 1238963059000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not Joseph Morchauser's \"Wargaming with Minatures\" it is not", "text": "Wargaming World War Two is the book I am reviewing.  Morchauser's book is the first book I read on wargaming.  That book covers ancient (pre-gunpowder), Napoleonic (gunpowder), and WW2 (modern) ground combat.  That was in 1962.  Even at that time Morchauser's book was horrible.  Wargaming World War Two is a masterpiece in comparison.  However it has some weaknesses.  First is the title.  WWW2 doesn't cover air or naval combat. A better title would be \"A Beginner's Guide to Wargaming WW2 Ground Combat in Miniature\".  In this the book does a fair job.  If you have never played a wargame or want to start gaming this period this book is a fair start.

Two unsolved crimes across a span of many years connected by one man. It sounds intriguing, right?

The narrators changed many times and went back and forth from past to present so often that my head was spinning, but I trudged on hoping for an exciting ending.<br /><br />As I continued reading, I found the characters to be completely self centered and totally incapable of seeing anything but what is right in front of them. I think Chaon purposefully wrote the characters to be this way, and I'm not sure I was really supposed to connect with them or like them very much. I hope not, because they were all extremely strange. There were many things I didn't enjoy about the book, but I still found myself unable to put it down. It definitely had a dark feel to it and I think that is why I felt so strangely about it. I liked it and at the same time I didn't.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Interesting read but sloppy genealogical references", "text": "This book is worth reading if you want to learn about a period in the history of China that is rarely mentioned, a time during which two Jewish families (originally from Iraq) built incredible business empires and also suffered through some very difficult periods. Mr. Kaufman\u2019s journalistic background serves him well here in that he presents non-fiction material in a compelling way that encourages you to keep reading.<br /><br />Where the author falters, however, is in laying out the Sassoon family tree accurately. Yes, it\u2019s a big family, but records are available that indicate who was married to whom and when, who had which children and when, etc. Many people will brush off these errors and claim that accuracy in this regard doesn\u2019t impact the narrative, but when a non-fiction author makes a mistake in genealogy not just once but at least twice, and he also makes confusing references to family members, it makes me wonder what else he is muddling or presenting inaccurately.<br /><br />The sloppiness starts early, on page xi in the Cast of Characters. The author refers to Flora Sassoon (1859-1936)  as \u201cThe wife of one of David\u2019s eight sons.\u201d Why can\u2019t he specify which son? Is the information really that hard to track down? I found it without too much trouble. Understanding who the many sons are and who their children are happens to be relevant as the history of the family unfolds. The Flora born in 1859 was the wife of Solomon; Solomon was born to David and his second wife, Farha/Flora. Yes, Flora\u2019s mother-in-law was also named Flora. Many people in this family had the same name, which makes it all the more important for the references to be clear and precise.<br /><br />Then, in Chapter 1, page 7, in writing about the patriarch David, who married at age fifteen, the author writes \u201cHis wife swiftly gave birth to four sons.\u201d No, she gave birth to two sons and two daughters. This is easily verified through multiple sources which all indicate that David\u2019s first wife, Hannah, died in 1826. Six of David\u2019s eight sons were born AFTER Hannah died, so how could he have had four sons swiftly? The first two sons, Abdullah/Albert and Elias were born in 1818 and 1820 respectively. The third son, Sassoon David, was born in 1832, well after Hannah died. Sassoon David\u2019s mother was Farha/Flora, David\u2019s second wife.<br /><br />On page 104, in referring to Rachel Sassoon Beer, Kaufman says \u201cLike her cousin Flora\u2026\u201d What cousin Flora? You can\u2019t just throw in a new Flora without explaining who she was. In addition to her paternal grandmother and one of her aunts (the one married to Solomon Sassoon), Rachel\u2019s mother was named Flora. That\u2019s three Floras. Who\u2019s this other/cousin Flora? Can you see what I mean when I say the family references beg for clarification?<br /><br />Not far into Ch. 5, bottom of page 107, there is an incorrect reference to Victor Sassoon as \u201cgrandson\u201d to family patriarch, David Sassoon. Victor was David\u2019s GREAT grandson, not his grandson. Maybe this is a typo in my hardcover copy that has since been fixed?<br /><br />The book is an easy and interesting read, but shame on the author and Viking/Penguin RandomHouse for their lack of due diligence.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Warning: This is NOT Kate Daniels", "text": "Despite being a more hard-core sci-fi fan, I had read the Kate Daniels books and liked them (although Curran not so much). They were stories with well thought out plots that had a bit of romance/sex mixed in. I'd been a bit too deep in my main genre lately, and figured I'd take a break with some lighter fare from an author(s) I had read previously. I now wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Here, there is a bare hint of a plot that is slowly spooled out between all of the panting over how 'hot' the male lead, Declan, is. Other reviewers have covered the issues in greater detail, but the gist is that you have a poor, rural girl who is comically portrayed as 'spunky', when the appropriate word is 'bratty'. Regardless, the hot, aristocratic Earl continually insists that he is going to 'have her' in a stalker sort of way, despite spending most of his time criticizing her lack of education and manners.<br /><br />In other words, it's the fantasy trope of a woman being so damned irresistible to a man 'just because' that, regardless of how unsuitable she is or how much she protests that she doesn't want him, he is still so attracted to her that he would do anything to have her. The cherry on that sundae is that his feelings for her (whatever they actually are beyond pure lust is questionable) develop despite his original intentions toward her. (Yeah, I've read \"Price and Prejudice\", and this thing couldn't shine its shoes on that score.)<br /><br />I am not a modern romance novel reader, so the only authority I have to go on is other reviewers when they say that this general type of trope (supposedly spunky/independent woman swooning at the feet of a big, burly alpha-male who overwhelms her with his muscles and misogyny) is common. As those reviewers have also mentioned, it does bother me that women can be involved in this sort of thing on the one hand, either writing or reading, and then have the cognitive dissonance to be able to protest their independence on the other hand.<br /><br />So, I guess if you're a 'normal' romance novel reader, but want a slightly fantasy setting, then this might pass muster with you, despite the story not being that good. If you're looking for a good fantasy story with a little romance mixed in, then this is definitely not the book for you.<br /><br />PS: I got the Audible version of the book, and literally broke out laughing, and I mean out LOUD, when they finally get down to doing the deed.

The story itself, taken on its own merits, is fairly good. It has an uncovering-the-magical-past vibe to it that is fairly gripping. The rest of the books are equally violent (one of the punishments inflicted on captured women by an invading army is to \"pass them around in the tents\" for the soldiers to \"use\" -- and yes, it is as bad as that sounds.  The entire series is EXTREMELY violent, and consists of the most vile and horrifying type of violence.  To this day I remember some of the scenes I read with chills.  The series also spends a lot of time harping on conservative ideas such as rape victims shouldn't choose abortion if they get pregnant as a result of the rape, and that private property and capitalism are THE way to go. (Not that I disagree with the free-market as a general rule, just making a point that the author makes this a big focus in the series -- ESPECIALLY in Faith of the Fallen).<br /><br />After the first book ... it just gets horrifying. There are numerous rapes of men and women (and attempted rapes). There is violence against women in general, torture (in detail, such as flaying the skin from a live victim), and other very adult, very dark, very unpleasant descriptions and story points. I want to make a point of emphasizing that they are STORY POINTS. They aren't scenes. In the first book, the male protagonist (Richard) is captured and spends a LARGE portion of the book being tortured and violated, etc. It isn't just a brief scene, it goes on for a LARGE part of the book, and the author makes every effort to try to make the reader sympathetic to the point of view of the attacker.<br /><br />The fantasy story itself is interesting, and if you can get past the rapes (which are so common, it would almost be comical, if it wasn't so horrifying) and general ugliness of the world the story is set in, then you may like this series. I, myself, only made it through the books I did due to my young age, and lack of a proper frame of reference.  As an adult, I cannot stomach them anymore. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to \"skip the bad parts\" because they are THAT laced with them.<br /><br />Like I said, the story itself and the world it is set in, is very good. You will like the story and want to know what happens next, if and only if you can overlook the negative points I have brought up in this review.<br /><br />2 stars if those negative points mean the same to you that they do to me. 4 or 5 stars if they don't.", "images": [], "asin": "0765362643", "parent_asin": "0765362643", "user_id": "AEBJB6KW2UBHRYWYXDLYKPIE5O2Q", "timestamp": 1341431152000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Needed More Story than Build Up", "text": "Crystal Bones by C. Aubrey Hall is the second of the Marshall Cavendish books I was sent to review.  It is the first of a trilogy of teen fantasy novels featuring the half fae twins Diello and Cynthe.  It is also, again, aimed at a younger audience.<br /><br />It all starts the night before the twins' thirteenth birthday when Diello hears a voice in the storm calling his mother.  This is, of course, foreshadowing into their parents' deep dark past, as mentioned in the blurb.  Diello is then disappointed when his father gives him a useful gift for his birthday rather than the traditional fun present and both twins are sent out to do their chores unlike any previous birthday they've had. The first few chapters seem to be pretty well dedicated to reminding the reader that growing up sucks.  There are however magic herbs in the morning milk which apparently get the fae either high or drunk and the fair is that day.  But they're told not to go because of the dangers of being around humans.  It follows that an errand for their mother leads them right into the thick of the fair and straight towards danger!  The deck is stacked against our heroes, will they survive and figure out the mysteries surrounding their parents' pasts or are they doomed to failure?<br /><br />I'm going to say right off the bat that I got caught up in Crystal Bones about halfway through, where the meat of the story started.  Up until then had been mostly lead up, background, and foreshadowing which, while necessary to the overall plot, wasn't particularly different from any other coming of age fantasy novel that I've read.  There were also some points where it felt like Cynthe could have been omitted from the book, while both twins were billed as the heroes in the blurb it  is very much Diello centric.  She does get some moments of awesomeness but, all told, could have been removed in favor of making Diello a bit more three dimensional. Hall also seems to think that if humans hating half fae isn't mentioned every time the twins run into a human the reader will forget.  This leads to a ton of fantasy racism which can make the book a bit hard to read at times.  Crystal Bones gets better as it goes, once I got to the meat of the story I was hooked.  Unfortunately it also cuts off rather abruptly in an almost painful sequel hook, leaving a rather unsatisfying ending and a year long wait to find out what happens.<br /><br />As a final note before I rate it, Crystal Bones seems to be Hall's first novel so I'm sure that most of the kinks will be worked out for the second book.  It's also worth noting that, any issues aside, I did enjoy the book it's just that most of what I enjoyed probably constitutes spoilers and I don't want to ruin anything for other readers.  That said, I give it a three out of five and a note to myself to keep an eye out for the next one.", "images": [], "asin": "076145828X", "parent_asin": "076145828X", "user_id": "AG457MWZMPAGAKMEZQDBCDSP3MMA", "timestamp": 1301775275000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "\"She is lying dead...her poor body crashed through the glass porch. She will never speak again in this life.\"", "text": "\"The Passing Of Charles Lanson\" by Louis Tracy (1863-1928) starts off with an attack on the beat copper Constable Barker while he is doing his rounds for the Derbyshire County constabulary of Sleaford, and during the attack, he's almost killed, twice.  To investigate the crime we are introduced to Superintendent Wood who, a local copper who will stay with us throughout the novel.<br /><br /> Proving that it never rains, it pours, so while investigating Barker's attack, Wood gets word that the great and influential finacial investor Charles Lanson has been murdered, stabbed in his study at his Sleaford Castle estate.  Enter into the investigation comes Dr. Macgregor, a Scotsman whose dodgy accent comes and goes at a whim.  Accompanying Macgregor and Wood to investigate Lanson's murder is the ace detective James Winter, Chief Superintendent of the New Scotland Yard.<br /><br /> The reader will soon get a whiff of the supernatural as we are also introduced to Charles' daughter Irene, a young woman who is subject to neurasthenia, and at time goes into trances, and seems to be able to channel the castle's long dead occupants.  Unfortunately, this is a plotline that goes nowhere, at least, until the end of the novel.<br /><br /> As the castle is searched, and the staff questioned, Irene's maid Alice Romer, has disappeared, only to be found draped unconscious across some turret steps.  What was she doing up there, and why is she unconscious?<br /><br /> Then as the novel progresses we will meet Deputy Inspector, and friend of Winter, Mr. Charles F. Furneaux who comes across as mixture of Colombo and Nick Charles, and his scenes with Winter are near priceless.<br /><br /> However, this is a serial novel, published in six parts in \"Argosy\" in 1924, and so, a story that could, and should, have wrapped up in a hundred pages or so is stretched to over three hundred.  Now, while it is true that the beginning is fairly good, and the last sixth is very good indeed, everything else in between, except for the interplay between Winter and Furneaux, just moves as slower than molasses in January.<br /><br /> Another problem is that this is an extremely wordy novel, so it is straddled with some very clumsy, and very formal, prose.  This wordiness however has none of the stylishness that can often go with such writing.  As one reads some of the bloated prose, and opinionated soliloquies, that make up this novel, I could actually see the author racking up the word count.<br /><br /> Now, some of this may just may be me, and maybe British pulp thrillers of this era were commonly written as such, but I still don't have to think such writing as good.  It's this style of writing that is another thing that dates \"The Passing Of Charles Lanson\".  A good example of the clumsy prose that can be found within Tracy's novel is \"I've known a crazy woman have full command of what she called her senses after swallowing twelve doses of bromide . . . \"<br /><br /> There is also a lot of casual racism directed towards Greeks, some of it is complementary, and a lot of it is paternalistic.<br /><br /> What I noticed after reading this novel is that police procedurals have really changed over the years.  Most of this novel, about three quarters of it, takes place over a twenty-four hour period, and through all of the melodrama, the palace intrigues, and the initial investigation, Charles Lanson is taken upstairs to cool and ripen like an old piece of fruit.  Even more, important evidence is just left lying about in the murder room.  Then Inspector Furneaux is given leave in the middle of the investigation to gallivant to Greece, and to accept some money slipped to him by one of the suspects.  And, sadly, once Furneaux is gone, the interplay between him and Winter essentially stops, and the novel sinks into the mundane again.<br /><br /> Anyway, I'm glad I read it, but if it could have been condensed down to a hundred page novella, some of the dull wordiness had been eliminated, and some of the characters had been more interesting, I would have given this novel a higher rating.  As is, this book is only recommended for pulp, British pulp, and British mystery completests, and even then, only if you can get it cheap.<br /><br /> For this site I have reviewed these other period fictions:<br /><br />Asterisk Club #1:  [[ASIN:0915230887 The Wooden Overcoat]] by Pamela Branch.<br />[[ASIN:B000K09H8G At The Mountain of Madness and other tales of terror]] by H.

After a much needed break [I had decided that I needed to give Alex Cross a little rest and enjoy some of Patterson's other works,like the winged people....now that was interesting and I enjoyed it] I picked up in the series where I left off....Big Bad Wolf. Unfortunately, after reading it I felt a little out of sorts and had to ask myself the question...\"just what do I think of this novel?\" I really had to search within myself and decide what was it that I just didn't get? Or is it that I got it, but wasn't sure if I liked it?<br /><br />Well for starters we still have the ever present Alex Cross, who has left the DC PD and decided to go Federal (FBI);then there's \"Mama Nana\" or whatever he calls his mother, who quietly states the obvious;his friend, Sampson who makes a cameo appearance and states that he is expecting a child; his absent girlfriend (Jamilla) who appears to be a little too mysterious for my taste at first, but appears periodically throughout the thriller (encouraging phone calls no less, hope she doesn't turn out to be a killer); Kyle (his psychotic ex-friend who use to work for the FBI); and a few others. Patterson also introduces new characters, like Monty (FBI computer expert, single with kids) and Mahoney (an eager partner who loves the excitement of having a partner who is willing to think out of the box....so I am sure he will either ultimately be killed or be the crooked FBI agent that is being paid off by the Wolf).  Unfortunately, most of my rating is based solely on the love I have for Patterson's creativity and not so much about my love of the book. Although there was A LOT of potential (I loved the mystery surrounding who the Wolf really is) it was a little confusing. Patterson spent the first have of the novel introducing a sadistic, kidnapping couple and killed them early on. He introduced a concept of white slavery among the rich...which was interesting, but then it seemed forced by introducing so many other \"bad things\" that the wolf was involved in....it just all seemed a little FORCED. Oh and another thing, because I am not in love with the character of Alex's baby's mother, Christine, I did not enjoy her reappearance after being absent for over a year. I didn't care about her as a character and wondered why she was coming back. It just seemed that while Alex was trying to solve his first case while joining the FBI, he just didn't need the drama surrounding his exgirlfriend's decision to claim their son. Of course I know, and you will too when and if you complete it, that the whole book is set up for the sequel, but I am not sure that I want to read it.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A personal political diatribe or a relevant medical-political thriller? You decide.", "text": "Michael Palmer died unexpectedly a few months ago in October of 2013. \u201cResistant\u201d is the author\u2019s twentieth and final novel. It stands alone, but it\u2019s the third book in the author\u2019s Dr. Lou Welcome series. The novel was complete and at the publisher before he died.<br /><br />I was curious to read his final novel. In the past, I\u2019d enjoyed the rich medical details, tight plotting, suspense, and intrigue of his earlier works. The author\u2019s untimely death saddened me and reawakened my interest in his work. I was curious how his writing might have changed over the years. I knew that he was a skilled commercial storyteller of unapologetically formulaic medical thrillers. It was a genre that has always held my interest, but lately, there seemed to be so many new and talented writers in this arena, I had no time or interest to return to Michael Palmer. Not until now.<br /><br />What I discovered immediately about this Lou Welcome series is that the author had branched out into a crossover genre half way between political and medical thrillers. The novel is still packed with his signature, testosterone-filled action, suspense and medical detail, but there is a major controversial political issue at its core. It\u2019s the same issue that\u2019s currently dividing our Nation. If you\u2019re on the liberal side of this issue, this book may please you. If you\u2019re on the conservative side, it will probably make you angry. Whatever side you\u2019re on, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recognize that the politics at its core is a gross distortion that adds nothing to the political debate.<br /><br />\u201cResistant\u201d is about a small clandestine group of ultra-fanatic right-wing conservatives. They call themselves the Society of One Hundred Neighbors. They came into existence in the era of FDR and Ayn Rand. Currently, they exist to rid the United States of all entitlement programs (especially Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) and free the country from what they see as the death grip of bankrupting debt. They\u2019re prepared to go to any ends necessary to achieve their goal, including biological terrorism. Their new weapon is the Janus bacterium, a germ very similar to streptococcus pyogens, the flesh-eating bacteria that causes necrotizing fasciitis. They\u2019ve unleashed the pathogen in target hospitals around the country. The government is managing the crisis in secret to contain public panic. The government calls the terrorist weapon the Doomsday Germ. The trouble is, the bacteria have gotten the upper hand. They\u2019re mutating. The Society\u2019s new antibiotic agent can no longer contain them.<br /><br />So how does the author\u2019s main character, Dr. Lou Welcome, get involved in the crisis and manage to be at the focal point of its resolution? Well, you\u2019ll have to read the book to find out, but I assure you: the plot is utterly unbelievable. But heck, this is supposed to be blockbuster commercial fiction. It may be over-the-top and downright silly in parts, but it kept me reading and entertained. Despite the ugly political distortions and exaggerated two-dimensional characters, I felt there was enough decent commercial fiction, suspense, and tension to earn it at least three stars.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I reread a few Michael Palmer obituaries and was stunned to realize how much Lou Welcome mirrors the author\u2019s own personal real life story. Both Dr. Lou Welcome and Dr. Michael Palmer had early careers as emergency room doctors; both men became addicted to pain killers, drugs, and alcohol and, partially as a result, lost their beloved wives to divorce; both men were disciplined by the medical profession and ended up serving in a volunteer capacity for a physicians-wellness organization assisting medical personnel with their substance abuse problems; both men eventually went into private practice in internal medicine. But the resemblance ends there. Lou Welcome is, of course, younger, brighter, stronger, more athletic, a greater risk taker, a more loyal friend, a more supporting father, etc. You get the picture? Lou Welcome is a fictional hero; he\u2019s also, certainly, Michael Palmer\u2019s tailor-made alter ego.<br /><br />As a medical doctor with a long history of substance abuse and recovery, Michael Palmer has been quoted as saying that he started writing suspense thrillers as a type of long-term personal therapy. \u201cWhen it comes to writing,\u201d he said, \u201cI loved the feeling of being in control when my life was not.\u201d Well, none of us are in control of the current political debate that is dividing our Nation. I\u2019m sure no matter which side you\u2019re on, you\u2019re probably immensely frustrated with your inability to control the situation. Obviously in this, his last book, Palmer was able to craft a plot that allowed him to not only be the heroic star of his own fictional world, but also a man capable of slaying his own private political dragon. I\u2019m sure he derived a great deal of satisfaction writing this book. You decide if you will enjoy reading it.<br /><br />Personally, I\u2019m pleased I read it. If nothing else, it gave me a glimpse of psychological insight into the real-life author behind the book.<br /><br />Dr. Michael Palmer, may you rest in peace along with your alter ego, Dr. Lou Welcome.", "images": [], "asin": "1250030927", "parent_asin": "1250030927", "user_id": "AGJKEO7CAVS472K2352YHRZEL2JA", "timestamp": 1394165401000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Ok but a little slower", "text": "Oddly there are very few biblical fiction books that take place during biblical times or involve people of the Bible.  It must be Amish fiction sells too well.  That or authors seem to be nervous of being termed heretics.<br /><br />With the first Noah book I enjoyed (Grade - B) and I like Chaffey's writing.  Noah feels like a real person.  He goes through character development. You understand his feelings and motivation.  All the things you're supposed to do in a story. In this book, we pick back up with Noah from his just married happy ending.  Oh and running away from the crazy princess who loves snake gods.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Noah is written as being more of a leader and husband and friend.  There are a lot of his personal aspects that are enjoyable to read.  He also faces doubt and indecisiveness at times.  Since we know the end story, this growth of Noah is really nice to see.  He's not perfect and he's not holier-than-thou.  The supporting cast of characters is interesting with Noah's friends being well written and sees Noah as a leader of the group.  However, it's not like the hang on his every word and always need to be around him.  There's a character who kind of gets a hero's speech in the middle of the book and it was nice that a supporting character could have that spotlight.  The plot makes sense of where it's going and there are some neat highpoint scenes that are fun to read.<br /><br />What the story had working against it was time factors.  We Noah leads a long life but the jump in years of hundreds is really a big thing to do.  This isn't like a character needing to advance in age by \"5 years later\" to get to their next plot point.  Nothing happened of note to Noah in the 600 year time gap?  On the other end of the spectrum, there is a lot of meandering plotting that happens.  Some of this is the result of the slow travel by boats but there is a lot of travel to one place then back home and then back to the one place again and then off to a side trip.  Noah's wife also feels like just a side character with kind of the normal thinking you'd probably guess she would have.  It would have been interesting to have her challenging Noah's ideas or turning Noah to a correct understanding of God's character.  She not a bad character but she just falls into a normal side character.  The villains also aren't that well presented.  It's the typical villains get power and so now they act crazy growth.  It would have been neat to see pagan leaders develop the system of worship without being on the verge of madness and show that while the evil is growing to show the need for the Flood, they are people.  They feel more like bad guy archetype characters than characters who are bad.<br /><br />Overall, a decent read with some slow parts in the middle and some location changes that happen quickly that I'm not sure how certain characters get to where they're at.  But with the knowledge that the Flood is coming, we know not all these characters can be with us for long and some neat plot points make it a good read and will want to continue the journey.

{"rating": 2, "title": "I knew I'd love this book.  I was wrong", "text": "When this book arrived I rushed to my bookcase to pull down my 1922 edition of The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book.  It was a slightly newer version than the one this book was based on, but I still expected that it would be fun to read Fannie's Last Supper and compare it with my disintegrating copy of the cook book, imagining what it would be like to put together a dinner party with recipes from 1896.  I should have left Fannie on the shelf and taken several other, newer cookbooks instead.<br /><br />It was a few days before I figured that out, though.  I started by reading from the beginning, at the author's story of buying an 1859 Victorian bowfront in Boston.  It was, apparently, not a pleasant place to live, with drug dealers on the sidewalk and a working girl with a customer in the neighbor's doorway.  The author confronted drug dealers, got ripped off by neighborhood children, and joined a historical society, and his family was robbed at gunpoint and attended a gay wedding, though not at the same time.<br /><br />All this might make an interesting book, and if I had wanted to read about relocating to South Boston in the 1990s I might have enjoyed it.  Eventually I got to the first recipe, Victoria Punch, \"courtesy of Donald Friary\", who is \"an expert on punch and punch bowls and a fellow member of Boston's St. Botolph Club\".  This was a bit of a surprise since Fannie Farmer had 15 punch recipes, including one for Victoria Punch which has nothing in common with Friary's.  But Friary's recipe looks far less sweet and contains ingredients which would probably be easier to find, so perhaps that's the reason for the substitution.<br /><br />The next chapter introduces Fannie Farmer a bit.  \"For starters, she was middle-class at best,\" it begins.  Apparently poor Fannie could not have afforded a membership in St. Botolph Club, even if women had been permitted to join in her lifetime.  We are, however, assured of Kimball's standing, since later in this chapter he discusses cooking dinner with his good friend Julia Child.  One of the two recipes in this chapter, Brown Bread, is based on a Fannie Farmer recipe.  The other recipe, Champagne Mignonette (to be served with oysters) has no source that I can find, but doesn't appear in my copy of the Cook Book.<br /><br />While several other recipes seem to rely on cookbooks published at a point in time near Fannie Farmer's cookbook, such as Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire, other sources include The Joy of Cooking and Gordon Ramsay.  Salmon is grilled, a method not even mentioned in the Cook Book.  The one common element throughout the book seems to be a certain level of scorn for Fannie Farmer.  \"What she may have lacked as a talented cook she made up for with a keen sense of showmanship, marketing, and giving the public what it wanted.\"<br /><br />I admit that a big part of my problem with this cookbook is that I could not get past my expectations of \"Two Years, Twelve Courses, and Creating One Amazing Meal from Fannie Farmer's 1896 Cookbook\".  It took me a few days to read most of the book, and two years to convince myself to pick it up again and read the last two chapters.  Many parts of the book are quite enjoyable, especially the discussion of handling foods that modern cooks rarely use, like the calf's head.  If the book had been marketed as a study of cookbooks from that time period (and if current sources had not been used,) I would have enjoyed it a great deal more.", "images": [], "asin": "1401323227", "parent_asin": "1401323227", "user_id": "AFQDVDIKXVY4J5IGKO4LSDS3DYPA", "timestamp": 1337717270000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

And no point is discrete unless and until you reach the Planck length.<br /><br />Byrne's explanation of Many Worlds begins understandably.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Coming of age story set in Paris", "text": "The theme for the Mocha Girls Read book of the month in January was Paris. As a group, we voted to read Black Girl in Paris by Shay Youngblood. This relatively short and extremely beautiful book was essentially a coming of age story for its protagonist, Eden, and a lovely way to kick off 2019.<br /><br />Black Girl in Paris is the story of a young lady and budding writer who picks up from her home in the United States with a little money and travels to Europe in search of the greatness that author James Baldwin wrote about. While there she encounters many people while trying to make a living and find creative inspiration in Paris.<br /><br />One thing I found it interesting about this book is that Youngblood set it in the 80s while writing it in the millennium. It could have just as easily been set in the time in which it was written. I suspect the author may have done this to demonstrate just how far way from home Eden traveled. With the technology today (and in the early part of the turn of the century), it's so much easier to be close even when there's great physical distance.<br /><br />Black Girl in Paris reads like a collection of chronological essays. Youngblood's prose is excellent and you want to follow her as a writer and Eden as the main character on this journey of self discovery. This book definitely kept me interested. This is not something I would have read but for book club. And that is one of the greater purposes of book club. I am glad I was able to partake and participate.<br /><br />My ultimate takeaway from this story is that we cannot escape racism no matter the time nor location.<br /><br />Recommendation: If you love Paris and the pursuit of one's dreams, this quick read might pique your interest.<br /><br />Until next time ...

When Homicide Lt. Eve Dallas catches a death at the former NYC nightclub \u201c12\u201d, she discovers, while searching the building, yet another body \u2013 just a skeleton actually \u2013 complete with a gun laying nearby. Almost unbelievably, the gun {such weapons are now banned in our 2060 Gotham!} was the murder weapon in both deaths, probably separated by five decades or so, leading to the speculation that the skeleton belongs to a famous singer who disappeared a long time ago and now haunts \u201c12\u201d. Various mysterious apparitional appearances and sounds lead to the ghostly rumors, about which Eve and hubby Roarke have a snitty argument. Naturally, Eve works the case and will eventually solve both murders, but it takes her a good while to out the somewhat surprising perp.<br /><br />160 pages in this edition make for an entertaining hour plus of reading \u2013 and probably one\u2019s enjoyment will vary directly with the fun generated by the haunted angle.

Our protagonist, Laurus, wear many hats and carries several names throughout the book, and perhaps that is a symbolic gesture to his always searching for meaning, identity and redemption.<br /><br />There is a rambling and a bit incoherent quality to much of the beginning parts to Laurus, and for that reason alone, it was sort of a slog and struggle to try to push onward. This is especially evident in the first two sections. There is a bit of structure in the opening part, where we learn the back story of the protagonist and his uncle, and how he begins his life journey, as well as the tragedy that inspires him to begin his quest. However, in the second part of the book, we are hit with episode after episodes of healing and such, and it just seemed a little too random, aimless and sporadic.<br /><br />As far as the text itself, I found some of book clunky with wording and expressions and I think it was just a translation issue or something. I also wasn\u2019t a big fan of some of the magical realism that came out of nowhere.<br /><br />Also, there are several shifts in time that seemingly come out of nowhere and are quite random. One reviewer mentioned how it felt like stories were just thrown in in any order with no relevance or coherence. I agree with that assessment, especially as we proceed into the second part of the book.<br /><br /> That being said, I think the best parts of the book are the final ones, and those made it worth the reading experience. I did enjoy several parts, such as the latter sections of Arseny\u2019s pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the spiritual and physical quest he undertakes to get there. Much of this journey is a sense of coming to terms with his guilt over a particular tragedy, and seeking redemption. So, to me, this section not only flowed with much more structure and precision, but the themes were more prevalent as well.<br /><br /> I heard many comparisons to the likes of Umberto Eco and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Middle grade fiction just misses the mark", "text": "I wanted to like this book more than I did, and I recognize that it is loved by many. I found that I was again and again put off by Ruthie's references to the \"dumb class\" throughout this novel. As an adult reader, I drew some conclusions. I assumed that ESL children were sometimes placed in remedial classes without regards to other options or additional supports. I also assumed that the author may have had a real-life experience as a child with this worry because Ruthie would not let it go. Ever. The notes at the back of the book confirmed this. I admit that I sped through the last half of the book waiting for Ruthie to articulate her frustration with misplacement of ESL children while also showing some humanity for all of the children who were assigned to the remedial class. If that happened aside from her thanks in receiving a get-well card from the class, I did not see it. This ongoing fear of being a student in this class and commentary from Ruthie made it difficult for me to care for her in the way a reader usually cares for a child protagonist of a book. I feel like this is a book that would cause more damage than good in a read-aloud. I loved the connection to Nancy Drew, Cuba, Poland, refugees, Jose Marti, Frida Kahlo and the infusion of so many cultures within her world. I liked that the central problem of healing, isolated from her usual world and activities, is not one often seen in middle grade novels. It's something that does become a reality for kids dealing with injuries and illnesses, and they should be able to see this represented in the pages of a book. By the end of the book, I found myself more interested in the untold stories of the children in the class that Ruthie scorned. I understand that this may be an unpopular opinion, and this book will do fine without my praise.

Marcus - too much to fit in the Subject: line!<br /><br />When I was in - approximately - third grade, _The Phantom Tollbooth_ and Madeleine L'Engle's _A Wrinkle In Time_ alternated in my mind as the Best Book In The World, depending, basically, on which one I had read more recently.<br /><br />As an adult, Martin Gardner's _Alice_ Annotations brought those books to greater life for me than they had ever had before.<br /><br />I was, therefore, expecting a fair amount from _this_ book.<br /><br />Expectations are a prison for the mind. One has to be happy with what one has to be happy with.<br /><br />In other words: I was disappointed.<br /><br />Not _completely_ disappointed, mind you. There's a lovely introduction relating the lives of Juster and Feiffer and how _TPT_ came to be - and also making me aware of a musical with lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. I'll have to check that out at some point, but right now I have this review to write.<br /><br />That introduction is the best thing Marcus has added to the book. The actual annotations are quite variable: some of them repeat information in the introduction; some of them contain information about mid-century America that might be interesting to someone younger than I, but as I recall much of it from my own life it kind of washes over me;  and a very small percentage tell me things I didn't know.<br /><br />Perhaps the dullest annotations are the ones where Marcus attempts to explain the jokes. This is a bit odd, because some of my favorite annotations in _Alice_ are explanations of jokes - but they explain jokes that I wouldn't have gotten without them, because I lack the context of a Victorian Oxonian logician. A number of Carroll's jokes have passed their best-by date, and Gardner refreshes them somewhat.<br /><br />This isn't true here. The jokes in _TPT_ are about matters a schoolchild of the current generation will understand.  As in _Alice_, there are some asides that are addressed more to grownups than to children; perhaps some precocious child would find annotations of these asides valuable, but no actual adult is likely to have any use for them.<br /><br />So I'm afraid I must judge this book fairly harshly.

{"rating": 3, "title": "A very good start to an interesting new series", "text": "Vanessa has a fabulous way of telling a story, so fabulous it's difficult to put the book down to see to other important things, like sleeping for instance.<br /><br /> I do have one request though, that there be in the near future a female character with a stronger personality.  Many female friends I know have endured deep wounds in their past which left them with emotional and physical pain, but they don't dwell on that past on daily basis. I myself would not have developed into the strong person I am had I dwelled as often as Vanessa' s heros do on wounds inflicted in my past. Inward reflections are character building for sure, we must not forget how we got to where we are, strong and empathetic women. When I would have a need to spend time trying to understand my stories by talking about them among close friends, there be those who would sympathize, comparing their past to mine, and those who shut down because they were too entangled in their own that there just isn't room for others', they didn't want to hear about my painful memories. But there were always a couple listening and deciding on the spot, was I stuck with my past or was there something to learn from my story and who I am in the present, does my present reflect my past in positive ways. They have empathy.<br /><br />The character Yvonne, the main character in this story, and Arrow , the main character in the last series by Nelson, both feature a wanne-be-strong female characters, but both fail continuously. They never really stop  remembering and flinching from their past, there is just too much concentration put on remembering and reliving their painfully past and feeling anxiety. We don't see her deriving strength from these revisiting, she doesn't seem to benefit from such ruminations, the reactions are always the same, weakness not strength, With a MC villain or hero, either way they need to be strong, living fully in the present. Neither Arrow nor Yvonne represent examples of how I describe strong women, the kind of women, who in spite of adversity, or because of them, are real role models, the kind I want for the up-and coming next generation of young women to emulate.  Our daughters need strong examples of heros in stories they read, heros who use injustice,  adversaries, emotional and physical pain suffered, covert these type of experiences into empathy, certainly not anxiously comparing every new situation with experiences from a difficult past .  The future of this world will be resting on strong and empathetic female leaders, heros. I personally want to feel empowered by the heroines in the stories I am reading, and like most readers I have experienced eye opening AHA moment from insightful storytellers and it's one reason why I love reading.  Maybe digging a little deeper this talented writer too will find just such a heroine ready to reveal herself.<br /><br />Her stories are well told, we come to know every character, the world they live in and why they do what they do too, eventually.  This deep understanding Vanessa has of her story is very obvious. Her attention to details do not distract from the suspense and adventures,  (I wish there was a map, my memory isn't what it used to be). The unexpected keeps me reading with anticipation. In the first book of this series we are made familiar with the characters, the world they live in and to a point, what direction the events will flow, what to expect.<br /><br />It works and flows well, until about chapters 23 onwards. Here it suddenly becomes confusing because the detailed background we been given doesn't fit, suddenly don't seem true anymore,  and also suddenly got very dark. I became confused about the story. What unfolded was all wrong, the connection severed, so much didn't fit with the background information I been reading this far. I'm still confused as to what suddenly happened, but then I skipped over several pages because they just didn't sound right. I actually skipped many of the last pages. There is also some violence which seemed over the top and the whole setup unbelievable even for fiction. I was unable to imagine the descriptions of events unfolding and actions taken by the characters, numbers and scenes  contradicting themselves from one paragraph to the next - there was an unexplained number of mercenaries which seemed to come out of nowhere, the numbers of slaves, the description of the scenes impossible and not what was said earlier. This entire section just didn't make sense. It feels as if the writer was struggling to keep the story together, make sense. That is a real shame, because the story up until that point has been so well setup, the details are carefully planned and developed over time, preparing  us for a well thought out story which would be told over several books. I will read book two based on the care with which Vanessa has taken, and the promise that entails for the quality of the full story yet to unfold. I feel it would be too early and too harsh to dismiss the whole story.", "images": [], "asin": "B07SBQXYZT", "parent_asin": "B07SBQXYZT", "user_id": "AEW2YGUXD34LIG4WI4YLRNNZL6XQ", "timestamp": 1641594014508, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Informative, But Only Introduction", "text": "The observance of the seventh-day Sabbath has been a contentious issue amongst many Christians for centuries in Europe and North America, but one place that may startle many is that it has been the same in Africa.  In his book &#34;Sabbath Roots: The African Connection&#34;, Charles E. Bradford brings to light many tribal and cultural customs from across the continent giving the reader evidence of the memory and observance of the seventh-day Sabbath from all corners of Africa.<br /><br />With over 2000 years of Biblical history as well as cultural studies of hundreds of tribes across an entire continent as well as the African diaspora to the Americas, Bradford had many sources to navigate and reference to give readers a sense of how Africans fit into the continuing debate on the Sabbath.  Beginning with how God is seen from the Biblical prophets and how He is perceived in the minds of Africans on both the continent and diaspora, Bradford brings to light where each stands to the other.  Afterwards, he delves into the subject of the Sabbath on the African continent in relation to God and to cultures in and outside of Africa.  Finally Bradford turns his attention to the history of Christianity on the continent, with a main focus on colonial period which it was considered both a forced religion from the outside and a religion of protest from foreign occupation.<br /><br />In roughly 230 pages, Bradford had to cover a lot over a wide scope of scholarship and while he did a remarkable job in an engaging text and strong use of numerous sources there was only so much he could do and does leave readers with questions.  The biggest and most important issue deals with the Sabbath itself.  Outside the well-known Black Jewish groups, the Falasha and the Lemba, and writing briefly about the Jewish diaspora in Africa, Bradford does indicate if the cultural and tribal traditions of the seventh-day Sabbath across the continent are all from Jewish contact or a mixture of Noahide memory and contact with Jewish influences.  This lingering question while not invalidating Bradford\u2019s thesis, does leave it up to interpretation.<br /><br />Although the question of when Sabbath entered into the cultural traditions of tribes all over Africa is unanswered, &#34;Sabbath Roots&#34; is still a very welcome addition to information about the seven-day Sabbath.  But Bradford\u2019s book should only be considered an introduction, especially in relation to Africa, and should inspire readers to look for more information after reading.", "images": [], "asin": "1578470560", "parent_asin": "1578470560", "user_id": "AFLGBVEMLLK253RZFCAKA224C4GA", "timestamp": 1494723060000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

Surely this mystery must have extra turns; surely this thriller trenchantly examines a current problematic social trend; surely the protagonist must be more humanly flawed than most and must be compelling and nuanced! What I read instead was a perfectly fine, perfectly mystery/psychological thriller. Sure, the bending of reality via flawed perception is in the zeitgeist; this is another treatment on the topic. Certainly mental health is an ever more prevalent concern; this book mentions some counseling and medication. At the end of the day willpower overcomes mental illness and I don\u2019t know that this is the most positive message to convey. Willpower is certainly a part, but so are vulnerability and professional help and exercise and meditation and eating and community and a thousand (rough estimate) other factors.

I can only hope that the breadth of his life's work fell intact into the hands of his graduate assistant, who took over instruction in his last days as a professor in Sacramento. Whether it has or not, this book is well worth considering, especially to a student designing his or her own research. Its annotations and bibliography promise an excruciatingly well investigated line of departure for any intended work on the period, right, left, or simply rational. Now, one last comment about the author: he himself was a graduate student of the Robert LeFevre-Howard Zinn lineage, with all its implications about revision of history to fulfil the prophesies of the sans-culottes.

The X-Men are shunted from our universe (known as Earth 616) to Earth 1610-- a parallel Earth in the multiverse that is home of Miles Morales, Ultimate Spider-Man.  Scattered throughout this alternate Earth, the X-Men are put to the test! Iceman finds himself fighting mole people in a very steamy Atlanta.  Beast becomes the prisoner of Dr. Doom. Angel ends up in the Savage Land. And X-23 learns the origin of mutants in this alternate dimension!

Most of the words in each story are not sight words.<br /><br />My son's school requires a lot of sight reading, so I'm always on the lookout for books with his sight words in them. This is not my favorite set. They could have put more than 2 sight words in each book, and made it less about phonics. To read these you have to know long vowels (the rules of silent e and double vowels), the rule that \"ew\" and \"oo\" can make a U sound, and other rules for sounding out words. But a student will probably be assigned all 50 sight words in the set before they get to all these other rules.<br /><br />Also, some words in these books are just too big for the young beginning reader. Pepperoni and Butterflies, really? They have a picture of a pizza, or a picture of butterflies, to give the student clues what these big words are supposed to be. I prefer a book to have words that are on the right reading level for the child, to reinforce words they already know, and introduce a few new ones in each book. (Rather than having big, new words they have to guess from looking at pictures, throughout the whole book.) Some people will feel that learning through context and clues is the right way, but it's just not my preference.<br /><br />The Bob Books Sight Words sets are more what I'm looking for.

{"rating": 1, "title": "Sub-par space opera", "text": "Evan Currie's \"Into the Black: Odyssey One,\" a re-edit and re-package of Odyssey One (2011), according to Cleigh Currie (see discussion here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/forum/cd/discussion.html?ie=UTF8&cdForum=Fx376GGZL25AFA0&cdThread=Tx25E3DQ888YYJP), is not exactly David Weber, but then not much in the sci fi universe is for those of us who enjoy the best of military sci fi. Most definitely the description of the book as \"a first-rate military science fiction epic that combines space opera and modern storytelling\" is stretching things just a bit, and I'm being generous.<br /><br />The story begins in the years after World War III, which took place as one might expect between and eastern and a western bloc. The protagonist, Captain Eric Weston is a fighter pilot who because of his heroics in the war has been promoted to captain the NAC (North American Confederation or simply `the Confed' and comprised of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico) ship Odyssey for a voyage of exploration into deep space (I should mention this is not exactly Star Trek either).<br /><br />The explanation that Weston's  \"rather public position as the flight leader of the Archangels had put him on the short list to captain her\" doesn't really explain why a fighter pilot is the best guy to captain a huge new prototype ship with an experimental drive on a voyage of intergalactic exploration. One would expect him to take command of a smaller ship first, or perhaps a staff position or perhaps command of all fighter defenses in the NAC. Certainly there must be officers who outrank him or have seniority. The reasoning seems to be that he is the hero, ergo he gets the ship, which isn't exactly how the military works.<br /><br />In any event, Weston arrives on aboard his new command and takes it into space. One doesn't find the crisp military protocol of the Honorverse here either; it is reminiscent of Star Trek where a more comradely and less formal atmosphere prevails. We are not given any description of the Odyssey when Weston arrives to take command, as one might expect, viewing the mighty new ship from the exterior on his approach, or even when he enters, which would seem another good opportunity. As the ship leaves the vicinity of earth and heads toward Mars we know almost nothing about it beyond a brief description of its drive and that it is now home to Weston's old unit, the Archangels. We know precisely nothing about its actual mission. Star Trek, at least, gave us that information at the opening credits.<br /><br />These deficits make getting into the novel difficult. By now I was only on page 22 and over 500 pages to go.  I found myself hoping that things would pick up once they left our solar system but I was quickly disappointed. Apparently the Transition drive works something like a Star Trek transporter, at least in appearance and the crew watches their ship disintegrate, and then reconstruct itself at its destination. The Transition drive description again loses in comparison to David Weber's description of hyperspace travel. Science aside, I could feel the sense of wonder and beauty, reading Weber.<br /><br />Arriving at Alpha Centauri they pick up some sort of distress call, identified as such by the \"linguistic telepath\" (I'm sorry, I started thinking Counselor Deanna Troi here) through means probably best not explained. It will take the Odyssey hours to clear Alpha Centauri's gravity well but rather than scout it, map it, scan it or even bother to look at it with anything approaching the wonder you'd expect, they sail right off on a 28-light-year journey to the distress signal. At this point I had pretty much lost interest in the entire enterprise (pardon the pun).<br /><br />Things just seem sort of random, lacking any real internal consistency. For example, upon learning of the distress call Captain Weston asks his XO, \"I don't suppose anybody we know is out there?\" How could there by anybody they know out there, 28-light-years away, if as seems the case, they are the first such ship to leave earth? Do you really want to sound that stupid in front of your subordinates?<br /><br />By page 56 I knew I had had enough. Arriving on the scene, the Captain decides he IS Captain Kirk and that his primary responsibility is not his own ship and crew, or even the mission (whatever that is) and that he can go running off in a shuttle to perform a rescue operation and let others worry about his responsibility. And what does he find? A pretty black-haired girl. I mean, look...nothing against Star Trek here. I enjoyed Star Trek. But this isn't supposed to be Star Trek - it's supposed to be a \"first-rate military science fiction epic.\" Sadly, old-school space opera seems to be the primary element of this tale and not particularly well-written old school space opera. This whole thing was completely predictable. You knew if there was no pretty officer on the Odyssey that the first thing Captain Weston would do was find one.<br /><br />No, Honor Harrington this is not. And it's not as though the writing is any great shakes either, as I said above. It's very light on descriptions and motivations. We don't know much about Captain Weston by page 56 and even less about his XO or any other crew members. We know next to nothing about the Odyssey itself and its capabilities (it took on fuel before leaving earth, but what kind of fuel? Reactor mass? What?), and still nothing about their mission, which seems to be along the lines of gallivanting around on the whim of the captain. The dialogue is not terrible but it's not great either and to be honest, the crew does not sound (or act) particularly military to me. Weston's XO is more his \"friend\" than his XO and I'm sorry, I wouldn't want to see my captain \"slump\" on the bridge in front of the crew. What kind of signal does that send? My seven-year-old would do that but I don't want my captain doing that.<br /><br />I honestly can't find a single good thing to say about this book except the premise - space exploration. It should be full of wonder but there is no wonder described in this book, either from the author's third person perspective or in the thoughts of the humans who are experiencing it. Captain Weston's last thought on page 60 is \"Command sucks\" - unfortunately, so does this book.", "images": [], "asin": "1612182348", "parent_asin": "1612182348", "user_id": "AFU7FI6YBMQHWY3AK2RURTUSAQKQ", "timestamp": 1332524375000, "helpful_vote": 38, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "At Least the Food Sounded Good", "text": "Caution for some very, very vague spoilers and a larger spoiler that\u2019s marked. The very last paragraph sums up my feelings without these.<br /><br />What can I say about this book other than I am mystified that people consider this good writing. There is good writing trying to escape here, crawling around through the words shouting \u2018please don\u2019t go\u2019 and perhaps with the level of editorial craftsmanship that Harper Lee had gotten this book would be excellent. The premise certainly was good but to me personally the execution was considerably lacking.<br /><br />The general gist of the story is of Mattie, a 78 year old woman who is spritely and who we mostly follow throughout, and her adventures with finding a dog and then a juvenile delinquent on her doorstep. Sometimes the point of view switches to other characters and that\u2019s one of the problems.  On page three we met her son Robert and on page four we get a random thought process of him worried she\u2019s alone and perhaps she should have a pet.<br /><br />Does this happen often and consistently? No.<br /><br />Instead this happens randomly throughout that we get into some character\u2019s head at any moment and it simply seems to be a mechanism to tell us something that the author doesn\u2019t know how else to put out there.<br /><br />Then there is the telling. Oh bless the light do we get hit over the head with some things. Mattie on tells us in various parts all about what her children are, what they do, why she has issues with them. It\u2019s an entire change in narration style to infodump on us. And it happens quite often that we get sudden spurts of information just pushed out there and left as though it is the only way to tell us these facts.<br /><br />Strangely enough we also don\u2019t get other critical information. While she tells us facts about her children we never get a sense of why they ae the way they are. All the details are the ones that float on the surface and anything that could be troublesome, those pesky reasons for character motivations or even real development that are tangled up and deeper down are never really addressed for anyone.<br /><br />The thing is though, and this goes back to my comment on the good writing trying to get out, the author does have chances to tell us this information in a more natural way that fits more with the punchy short style he seems to prefer. Examples:<br /><br />- Mattie has thoughts  about buttons at one point which is poignant and gets across her feelings about certain things regarding her children far more naturally then her just randomly thinking Very Important Details of them while making lunch.<br /><br />- After point blank telling us about how she doesn\u2019t like a character Mattie drifts during a prayer thinking about said woman in a way that would have gotten that idea across and made me want to throw the book across the room because it was so much better.<br /><br />- A gossiping character provides background information while on the phone and it feels exactly what this character would do. I wish there was more of this instead of the random dumps of character details we get.<br /><br />[Spoiler]<br /><br />This brings us to the ending which I will not talk about in any detail but re-reading the last few pages makes me wonder if Mattie is doing what she\u2019s doing because it\u2019s right or if it\u2019s because she wants to fulfill her own needs which some may see as shellfish. I\u2019m going with the latter, that she didn\u2019t grow the way she should have to be able to get to the point where she\u2019s doing what the book has talked about for over a hundred a pages of its length \u2013 to treat even the worst among us as well as if they were Jesus.<br /><br />Not to mention what she\u2019s going to do when her so called friends at her church turn around and bite her and she finds out after her supposed breakthrough. Especially after her daydreams about the warmth and healing nature of church and how that's going to tear her world apart. Or the reaction of her children since they already see her as lacking at her age and could take rather drastic steps to stop her. It\u2019s a cliffhanger ending leaving us without a clear resolution of the cascade of events Mattie has started.<br /><br />I suppose it\u2019s just me but if you want to bring in events that could ruin a character\u2019s life don\u2019t add them to the end of a rather fluffy novel about a Southern lady who disarms all arguments with cooking.<br /><br />[End Spoiler]<br /><br />One reviewer I read wondered if the author actually liked his main character and after re-reading certain parts I want to agree with them and say no. In fact most characters were portrayed negatively especially the church women. While I won\u2019t deny that I haven\u2019t met women like this growing up in the church (I definitely have) or seen the behavior exhibited by them at the same time there was like no one good. No one that followed what was preached. I\u2019d go so far to say as the only one the author actually sympathized with is Wesley since he actually got a much clearer redemption arc while almost everyone else merrily paved their path to hell.<br /><br />Please remember that the above is my own personal opinion and that those who read this may find it the cats meow. To me it was a disappointment especially considering the plot of an older woman who is still independent. I grew up with grandmothers and great-grandmothers and even great-aunts who were like Mattie in terms of her activity level and they were like that into their nineties (minus the lawn mowing of course at that age!). I like seeing older protagonists in literature, especially women, and was disappointed greatly that Mattie herself seemed like an idealized version that wanted to change but in the end made me question if she had at all.", "images": [], "asin": "0345346491", "parent_asin": "0345346491", "user_id": "AG4N7LVZNPFIIID4VM4MGTTYPN6A", "timestamp": 1471942462000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

It was also light in tone, humorous and pretty wild when it came to space adventures. I found it to be philosophical and slightly absurdist approach to discussing serious \"world issues\" in a \"oh well, that's what it is\" manner.<br />  What didn't quite work for me were the characters. I was having a hard time liking anyone. I didn't like Jenny very much mostly because while she has done terrible things in the past, we meet her at a point where she's past those and trying to be nice. There isn't anything terrible about her now and she's sincerely apologetic, but since the horrible stuff she's done is constantly mentioned, I had a weird discourse in my general feelings about her. I guess I wanted to see the struggle, maybe? It's like you'd meet an ex-Nazi character who worked in concentration camps a few years back, but now he's all good, doing the right stuff, saying the right things... And that\u2019s your protagonist. (It was very much Jenny\u2019s story, more so than Gary\u2019s).<br />I didn't particularly like Gary either. Reason - Gary didn't have much of a personality. He was as flat, emotionless and languid as they come. Now one could argue if that's because Gary is part-unicorn and maybe they aren't very emotional beings, so we have this effect, or maybe it's just Gary himself, yet we get this part good guy part doormat combination that wasn't very appealing. Ricky is morally ambiguous and very questionable, helping you one moment and selling your momma out next\u2026Honestly, no one got much affection from me when it came to characters, besides dwarfs maybe. I'm usually having a hard time with books like that.<br />This issue aside, it was well-written and had some good thoughts on different social, racial and political problems presented as a sci-fi wild romp, without being preachy.

Not so much for me.", "text": "Review by Squeaky Books guest reviewer: River<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this book is a personal one: it was written young. I was hoping for a young adult novel, which I usually think of as anything suited for kids 12 or 13 and above. However, this book sat at about more of a fifth grade level, complete with cute (and I do mean cute in a nice sense, not a derogatory one) little pictures every couple dozen pages. It didn't help the age level when the main character and her sidekicks were also in elementary school. I haven't read a book from the perspective of an innocent little kid in a long time and it was a hard adjustment.<br /><br />It had an atypical feel for a fairytale retelling, in that it seemed so innocent and young and naive. Even though the basis for this story is a little darker, the book seemed relatively happy and simple. It just simply wasn't suited for the age group it's sold to. I gave it to my little sister who was twelve at the time and told her to read it and tell me what she thought. She read it, shrugged and said it was a simple, easy read. She didn't dislike the book, but she wasn't crazy about it either.<br /><br />A simple, innocent read for younger children in elementary school is basically what this book is. It's not a bad book and there's nothing inherently wrong with the storytelling or characters, it's just young.", "images": [], "asin": "0062015052", "parent_asin": "0062015052", "user_id": "AGFXCRUOJGV7TEMBLX3ODZQTAFVQ", "timestamp": 1365693714000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
{"rating": 3, "title": "The Lesser(?) of Two Evils", "text": "The time is in the distant future. There are several human empires in the galaxy. Two of them are at odds with each other and neither is a particularly thrilling choice.<br /><br />On the one hand, the \"Risen Empire\" is ruled by an emperor who has been dead for centuries. He was once a doctor who tried desperately to save his kid sister from a fatal disease. He succeeds, sort of. He finds a way to introduce a \"parasite\" that keeps the body animated and the mind active after death. He tries it on himself in a grand suicide and then bestows this gift on his sister. The result is immortality after a fashion. Another result is raw power. By being able to bestow immortality on selected people, he is acclaimed as emperor. The living now have to maintain the overhead of an increasingly large population of the dead.<br /><br />Another empire which sprang from humanity is very different. It is one of artificial intelligences of planetary scope. These intelligences exist only to propagate themselves throughout the galaxy. A faction of humanity worships these intelligences and has in turn been modified by them.<br /><br />As the book opens, the cyborgs have attacked an imperial planet in an effort to seed a mind. In doing so, they have captured the sister of the emperor and the imperial fleet is in place to try and stop this propagation. They do manage to defeat the hostage takers but not before the mind is seeded or the imperial sister is killed. The emergent mind learns a secret about the emperor before its commandos are killed. We never learn what that secret is but the mind will do anything to get its one remaining commando into a position to transmit the information to one of its ships still in place. The emperor is so frightened by this possibility that he will sacrifice anyone and anything to prevent it.<br /><br />Caught in the middle are two principle persons. One is the captain of the ship tasked to attack the cyborg ship and the other is his lover, a powerful senator of the opposition.<br /><br />The book is well written and keeps interest throughout. It posits some interesting ideas and has a good story. The fact that we don't know what the secret is makes for a minor irritation but the only real problem is the ending. The stage is set for a confrontation between the captain's little ship and the alien behemoth. The stage is set but the actors never get where they are going.

There is noone lining up behind these \"leaders.\"<br />3) No proven aptitude with any issue of importance.<br />4) Wealth - All recent PMs went to Eton, where they dreamt of the day they could grab this role; not, where they dreamt of any societal fixes.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Unsatisfying ending...", "text": "I don't really know how to even begin this review. I didn't dislike the book so much as I felt like it was incomplete and therefore, unsatisfying.<br /><br />First, we have our sexy hero, Jake, who was bitten by a creature several years ago and now has to lock himself in a cage every time the moon is full because he is a werewolf and is afraid he'll harm or kill someone. Despite his \"love 'em and leave 'em\" approach to women, he's a good guy at heart. He's only ever been really drawn to one woman and it was after that one night they shared that he was bitten, and he's never seen her again.<br /><br />Enter the new day camp coordinator, Josie, and of course, our hero's long lost obsession. She's got a tragic past, and is living the dreams of her deceased husband instead of her own. Turns out he was killed by some creature out in the wild four years ago. She hasn't gotten over it or beyond it and she's not looking for any kind of entanglement. Especially not with Jake, who tormented her in elementary school with snakes.<br /><br />On the night the moon is full, she happens to stop by his office. Before he can make leave, the change is upon him. He tells her to lock him in his cage even as he is changing before her eyes. Her shock prevents her from locking the cage.....and it's a darn good thing, because another wolf pops up and seems intent on killing her. Our hero gets out of his cage, and engages the other wolf in a bloody fight.Josie passes out in the cage, having locked herself in for protection from both of them.<br /><br />And thats it.  Well, there is the struggle of their relationship, her coming to grips with his werewolf condition, his coming to grips with the fact that he might just love her. Some steamy sex. The fact that maybe Josie has been the target all along, not Jake and not her deceased husband. Unfortunately, the author never fully fleshes out this side of the story. Very little time is spent on the the attempt on her life, the mysterious wolf Jake fought, or really even anything to do with Jake's condition. The story ends with a short epilogue but it answers no questions (and I had several)and it didn't have the feel of a book that was being set up for a series.<br /><br />For a paranormal romance, there isn't a whole lot of that aspect to the story. Jake's change is pretty much the extent of it. Hard core paranormal readers who like Laurell K Hamilton, Lora Leigh, Christine Feehan or Sherrilyn Kenyon will likely be disappointed with that. The relationship aspect of the story is well done and the love scenes are steamy.

{"rating": 1, "title": "A Typical Libertarian Manifesto  ( with a trust fund)", "text": "Much of the book is taken up by an exhaustive listing of how the &#34;regulatory state&#34; has taken away our liberty. This is sadly true but it has been presented in earlier and more interesting works such as Philip K Howard's &#34;the Death of Common Sense&#34;.<br />Murray's only original idea is legal defense fund for individuals and business owners who fall prey to the capricious regulatory system. This is a great idea and if the book ended there it would have been a valuable pamphlet.<br />However Murray goes on to present a (very interesting) description of US demographics starting with the founding in the early 1600s, which he then uses to support the idea that America is best when it is diverse - in the sense of everyone letting everyone else do whatever they want. Here is where the classic libertarian ideology slyly presents itself.  While carefully avoiding direct statement he proposes that the liberal &#34;blue&#34; urban areas be allowed to embrace homosexual marriage and legalized drugs while the conservative &#34;red&#34; counties not be forced to comply. He repeatedly states that everyone be allowed to live &#34;as they see fit&#34;. This is his definition of Liberty.<br />Murray's highest praise is for the internet which allows freedom of choice in consumption and expression of ideas.  Here also the amoral libertarian view becomes obvious. He does not take into account a human nature that often chooses what is bad. The first growth sectors of the internet marketplace were gambling and pornography, and the internet &#34;marketplace of ideas&#34; is recruiting Jihadis from  American suburbs.<br />At one point he makes a remark about the poor behavior of some students in American schools and how common sense would dictate that these students be expelled so that others can learn in a safe environment..  While trying to make a point about free choice Murray unconsciously reveals the central problem with American society - that while we can usually identify what is bad( crime and violence), we are increasingly losing the ability to agree about what is GOOD,", "images": [], "asin": "0385346514", "parent_asin": "0385346514", "user_id": "AGHCDSDMCEB23LYKRPOEUOR6DQWA", "timestamp": 1438091558000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Disappointingly difficult to read - and the content is disjointed", "text": "It saddens me that I cannot award this effort more than 3 stars. There is no question that the author is making a sincere, earnest attempt to produce a useful beginner's  instructional manual for Artisteer, a specialty program for web template creation that has a moderate learning curve.<br /><br /> Unfortunately English is not Jakub Sanecki's first language and Packt Publishing did not provide extensive editing, with particular attention to syntax and composition.<br /><br /> The result is prose that simply doesn't flow well. The language is clunky and difficult to read. Worse is that the author's approach is disjointed, jumping from subject to subject. This approach frequently left me confused. The author is clearly trying to take this moderately complex application and render it accessible to a new user. The Artisteer manual itself will accomplish that purpose - but it will take several careful readings and a lot of experimentation.<br /><br /> Sanecki's book is simply difficult to read. For example: \"Shapes are graphic objects (in the form of geometric figures) that you can insert into the header.\" The parenthetical that shapes are \"geometric figures\" is redundant and superfluous considering that there are two illustrations depicting shapes on the facing page. The use of illustrations is also problematic. They are straight screenshots, occasionally with a single line caption below. The illustrations could have been made vastly more effective by providing numbered callouts describing the various operations being discussed.<br /><br /> There are valuable and helpful hints and tips scattered throughout, but their presence does not compensate for the language and lack of editing. There are also glaring omissions, such as not pointing out that you cannot directly create a two-line headline in a title block, a big issue for many, including me. You have to modify the code outside of Artisteer.<br /><br /> Overall, the author has clearly made an effort to help the user new to Artisteer. But considering the high cost for this relatively thin book, one might be better advised to make their way through the Artisteer manual - twice if necessary - and try things out along the way.<br /><br />Jerry", "images": [], "asin": "1849699410", "parent_asin": "1849699410", "user_id": "AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA", "timestamp": 1383195021000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "\"The stiffs. The corpses. In the morgue. They've come back to life.\"", "text": "\"Handling the Undead\" is a zombie book. But not the typical gory, horrendous BRAAAAAAINSSSS-craving type. Instead John Ajvinde Lindquist slowly weaves together an intelligent, philosophical look at what would happen if the dead were to unnaturally rise from their graves... and the only flaw is that the middle section of the book is so SLOW.<br /><br />Something strange is happening in Stockholm -- the weather is oppressive, electrical glitches are everywhere, and everybody has a headache.<br /><br />But when the strange conditions vanish, everybody who has died within the last two months rises from the morgue, funeral homes, and even their coffins. The \"reliving\" wander back to their old homes, mute and seemingly unaware, shocking their loved ones. And of course, the government quickly rounds them up and confines them, until they can be sure what dangers the \"reliving\" might pose.<br /><br />In the days that follow, Lindqvist follows five people whose loved ones have come back -- a comedian sunk deep in denial about his wife being gone, a wannabe-rebel teen, a grandfather and a young mother trying to help her undead son \"recover,\" and a widow who believes that she has a mission from the Virgin Mary. But something else is approaching Stockholm, bringing unexpected effects in its wake.<br /><br />\"Handling the Undead\" doesn't really focus on the zombies themselves. Instead, Lindqvist conjures up a simple scenario, and examines how people would react to it -- we see hysteria, suicide, denial, dismissal, religious fervor, and a delusional belief that the zombies can simply go back to their old lives. And he brings up a number of philosophical questions with no easy answers.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this book is that it should have been much smaller. Lindqvist spends most of the book's middle section spinning his wheels, with nothing really happening. And we never really find out WHY the dead rose, just that it is somehow an error.<br /><br />Fortunately the beginning and ending are filled with subtle, creeping psychological horror (the whole scene with the grotesque drowned zombie is nauseating), as well as the painful scene where David and Magnus meet Eva again. And there's an exquisite metaphysical edge, which implies that there's more out there than just zombies -- think an elusive, benevolent figure with fishhook fingertips.<br /><br />Lindqvist also fleshes out his characters beautifully, giving each one a backstory that shapes their current reactions. And he handles each one with compassion, even if they're delusional or twerpy. Among the best are David (desperately clinging to hope and unable to grieve), Flora (a rather annoying a teen who thinks she's an iconoclast), and Anna (whose son Elias has \"come back\") -- and even some of the zombies show a glimmer of personality.<br /><br />\"Handling the Undead\" is a deeply flawed book -- the entire middle section is bogged down. Yet it's still a beautiful, affecting read.", "images": [], "asin": "1847249906", "parent_asin": "1847249906", "user_id": "AHVIMKECEZDXXK5QIGX7KWJPN6DQ", "timestamp": 1289881972000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "Revisionist history at its best and at its worst", "text": "This is a very interesting, and at times fascinating book about the Roman disaster at Carrhae and the death of Crassus, arguably the most powerful member of the first triumvirate (the other two being Pompey and Caesar) in 53 BC at the hands of the Parthians commanded by Surena.<br /><br />To begin with (and although most of the source discussion is pushed back into an appendix), the author has definitely studied and well-researched his subject. He has also identified the rather negative - and often implausible - biases contained in these sources, in particular in Plutarch, whose moralising agenda seems, once again, to have been privileged over historical accuracy.<br /><br />The main interest of the book lies in the portray that it paints of Crassus, and the explanations that the author provides with the awful reputation that this \"loser\" acquired in Roman literature, a reputation that has mostly prevailed to this day. Gareth Sampson strenuously and valiantly attempts to rehabilitate the reputation of the vanquished Roman warlord who paid the disaster with his life. In particular, he makes a number of convincing points showing that Crassus was a highly efficient, successful and experienced Roman senator with a colossal fortune, huge political experience, vast political connections and significantly more military experience that he is usually credited for. Moreover, although about sixty years old when he left on his Parthian campaign, he was far from senile and very much at the top of his campaign.<br /><br />Regarding his military experience, he was the real victor of Spartacus' slave rebellion, although Pompey managed to get some of the credit for it, in one of his usual exercises of one-upmanship. As the author shows, this was no mean feat in itself, even if the Romans did not consider that military victories over slaves were worthy of triumphs. He was also Sylla's right hand man and he had saved the day for his boss, almost a decade before, as Sylla and his army fought the faction of Marius at the gates of Rome.<br /><br />As the author admits, he also had some more unsavoury sides which gave him a reputation for avarice and greed. This, however, may have been at least in part the result of defamation by his enemies because he seems to have used money as a weapon to bride, but also as a means to increase his political influence and to extract favours from those who owed him. Among other uses, his huge fortune attracted to him a clientele of young, ambitious, competitive and ruthless scions of senatorial families, of which Julius Caesar was but one. This feature, as shown in the book, meant that he could select the senior officers for his Parthian campaign from among the best of the competitive and aggressive young senators.<br /><br />The author also does a good job when explaining the reasons that Crassus had to go on such a campaign: military glory was a key element in becoming, or, in Crassus' case, in maintaining his position among the top men in Rome. He needed it, especially since Caesar was acquiring masses of it in Gaul. Moreover, he also needed to trump Pompey, who had acquired his glory and fame in the very same place (Syria) a decade before and was highly popular in Rome, unlike Crassus. Sampson also does, in my view, mostly a good job in showing that, contrary to what the main sources imply or sometimes state, Crassus' preparations were thorough and meticulous. He was known for his prudence and organisation and he recruited a vast army which he thoroughly trained to the extent that it was largely (but not only) made up of recruits.<br /><br />This is, however, the point where the author starts going too far, in my view. First he attempts to find all sorts of excuses for Crassus and tries to exonerate him from any responsibility in the disaster, including an attempt to shift the blame on Cassius Longinus (one of Caesar's future assassins), one of his lieutenants and the only one who survived whom he accuses of cowardice and of abandoning Crassus in particular. He also attempts to justify each and every of Crassus' decisions and tries to show that, under the circumstances, it was the best option. Some choices may be debatable. One can argue as to whether choosing a different route would have been preferable, bearing in mind that less than twenty years later Marc Antony chose to invade through Armenia with an even larger force and barely avoided a disaster of even greater proportions.<br /><br />In other cases, however, exonerating Crassus seems much more difficult. These include, in particular, the inability of his forces to cope with Parthian cavalry and the mistakes made in offering to his enemy exactly the kind of terrain and battle which maximised their advantages while cancelling those of the Roman legionaries. As another reviewer has noted, this is where Gareth Sampson is forced to resort to speculation and attempts to make Surenas, the Parthian commander, into some kind of military genius. Allegedly, he carefully analysed the Roman army, planned a brilliant strategy accordingly and build up his own force accordingly in order to overwhelm it.<br /><br />As this reviewer noted, this is very unlikely and I would add that it is largely incorrect. There was simply nothing original in Surenas' all-cavalry force made up of horse archers and heavy lance cavalry. All Scythe and Sarmatian tribes had been organized in such armies for centuries from the Danube and the Black Sea and Central Asia. Moreover, such forces were not exactly new either. The Parthians conquered Mesopotamia and defeated the Seleucid armies almost a century before using the very same tactics. These tactics were typical of the Scythes (to which the Parthians were related), and of steppe nomads more generally. They had been used for hundreds of years.<br /><br />In reality, the author's attempt to make Surenas into a \"military genius\" seems to be an attempt to cover-up Crassus' dismal intelligence failures and the fact that he grossly underestimated and possibly even despised his enemy. He was aware of the need for him to have some good and reliable cavalry but started off with too few of them (the 1000 Gallic cavalry who were massacred with his son, the light troops and several cohorts of legionaries when attempting to break the encirclement and come to grips with the Parthians). Moreover, he started the campaign with almost no missile infantry capable of shooting back at the Parthian horse archers without being outranged (only 500 foot archers) or able to inflict any significant damage on the cataphracts (no slingers).<br /><br />Finally, his mixture of typically Roman overconfidence and arrogance, built from constant victories against very different foes, played straight into the Parthians hands. Perhaps in part because of his overwhelming numbers, and because his previous military experiences had been in close contact fighting, he offered the enemy - an all-cavalry force - exactly the kind of battle that they excelled at. At the very least, and as another author mentioned, there was from the Roman side a complete breakdown in military intelligence for Crassus quite obviously did not even know who he was fighting.", "images": [], "asin": "1932033890", "parent_asin": "1932033890", "user_id": "AGAYTQENQ4WNDQK6CHIVWTCP4PNQ", "timestamp": 1369520748000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 2, "title": "I'm suprised and disappointed, This book basically only covers one street in the French Quarter.", "text": "I'm surprised and a bit disappointed by this book.  It would be more appropriate to call it \"A Walk Down Historic Royal Street\" because that's mainly what it covers. Virtually the entire book is a tour of Royal Street in the French Quarter from end to end with a few side trips that take you a block or two away from Royal Street. Other than that, the only exceptions are a very short chapter of the Moon Walk and another short chapter at the end of the book about Esplanade to the U.S. Mint and French Market.  That leaves the vast majority of the French Quarter completely unmentioned, which is a shame, in my opinion.  The title of the book is misleading, to put it mildly. If you are looking for a book about the entire French Quarter, look elsewhere. I'm still looking for such a book. There's so much more of interest in the French Quarter than Royal Street.<br /><br />I'm a bit bewildered by the positive reviews here because none of those reviewers seemed to have noticed that this book only covers a very small part of the French Quarter.<br /><br />BTW, there are numerous errors in the book but not enough that it's a big issue.  At least one address is listed that never existed and never did exist. I have no idea how that error crept into the book because that address follows and existing address that he mentions so it's not a typo. The block ends before it every reaches the number the author mentions as a building of interest. But anyone using this book while touring the French Quarter is probably interested in historical accuracy so they should be warned.  Little errors occur frequently in the book. As just one example, on page 65, the author states that Jackson Square was named in Andrew Jackson's honor in 1851.  Actually, it was named in his honor in 1815.  The statue of Jackson was placed in Jackson Square in 1851.  No big deal but I like to be able to trust information in books like this.<br /><br />It would also have been nice if more of a physical description of the buildings was included to help the reader identify the buildings now because many buildings in the FQ do not have their addresses marked. In one case, the author describes a building as being one of the only buildings in the FQ that is set back from the street with its courtyard in front and yet the building is built right on the street like every other building on the block and there is no courtyard in front. This could cause some head-scratching for the tourist using this book as they walk Royal Street. The only thing I can think of is that an aerial view shows that there is a building set behind the building on the street but the building on the street appears to be very old. Visitors can't see the rear building from the street if that's what the author is referring to. It almost seems as if the author never actually saw the building he is writing about but rather read some account of a building that is behind the building that visitors will see. He never mentions the buildings you will actually see at that address. That's just another example of errors in the book.  For a small book like this, there really is no excuse for these types of errors, in my opinion.  I found several of them when I first received the book and quickly perused the pages before reading it.  A quick proof-read by someone who lives in the FQ would have caught the errors.  If I can spot numerous errors just while scanning over the book before reading it in detail, that's not a good sign, especially since I know very little about the FQ and live in northern Illinois.", "images": [], "asin": "1626192804", "parent_asin": "1626192804", "user_id": "AGBQO7A6MUCQVBUCJR747S2EHBWA", "timestamp": 1417219814000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "a few unexpected turns but also suffers from overly familiar element", "text": "(review originally appeared at fantasyliterature.com)<br /><br />Troy Carrol Bucher\u2019s Lies of Descent is the first book in a new trilogy set in a world of magic, fallen gods, clashing cultures, and internal conflict within cultures.  While the writing is solid enough, and Bucher offers up a few unexpected turns, the book suffers from overly familiar elements.<br /><br />Ages ago the gods of light (led by Parron) and darkness (led by Tomu) warred with each other and to prevent that war from wiping out all life, the gods of light sacrificed themselves to drag their foes down with them to mortal lands where their power, though still strong, could not destroy the world. Those mortal descendants with the blood of Parron can wield magic, and the two warring militaristic cultures of the world, the Esharii and Draegorans, both test their youth and then train them (though the Esharii do so only for males).<br /><br />The book opens with 12-year-old Riam being tested by a Draegorian and then collected for training. He\u2019s soon joined by Nola, a young girl who also tested positive, but events intervene before they can reach the island base of the Draegorians, with Nola captured by the Esharii and Riam finding himself sold off into quasi-slavery in a strange city. The other major POV focuses on Ky\u2019lem, close associate to an Esharii warleader whom Ky\u2019lem thinks leads too much with his muscle than his brain.  Ky\u2019lem\u2019s desire to see the tribes unified and adapt to a changing world puts him in some conflict with his friend and eventually sees his life intertwine with Nola\u2019s as an Esharri spirit-walker puts into motion his plans to prevent the horrid future he\u2019s foreseen involving the return of Tomu.<br /><br />The two youngsters come from quite different backgrounds, with Riam living a hard-scrabble farming life with an older brother and a father who regularly beats them both.  Being plucked from that life is therefore a relief to him.  Nola, on the other hand, is the daughter of two loving parents who have raised her in a comfortable, prosperous and pampered lifestyle, and she therefore spends a lot of her early pages complaining about the shift in her fortunes. This doesn\u2019t do her character any benefits, and it seems even the author is somewhat uninterested as the writing in her sections pales in comparison to Riam\u2019s segments.  While Riam gets to help fend off several Esharii attacks, becomes leader of a group of other young candidates, and plots his escape from slavery (as well as take down a villain), Nola mostly gets to stoically deal with being tied up and/or led from place to place. She even spends a chunk of time unconscious.  This does eventually change as she comes into her power, but unfortunately not until toward the end of the novel, leaving her feeling eclipsed by both Riam and Ky\u2019lem for most of the story.  And there\u2019s a strange aging side-effect of that power that seems a bit too contrived to age her up so other elements don\u2019t feel creepy (though I confess they still did) and that also doesn\u2019t get enough examination within the story for such a huge change.<br /><br />The story, as noted in the intro, is also more than a bit familiar, with a war between gods, a young person (or two in this case) learning they\u2019re \u201cspecial\u201d (and then even more special than the other specials) thanks to their blood/background and then getting whisked off from their old life to be trained to use their powers, a patriarchal tribal society, a strictly regimented militaristic organization, an upper-class bully, and so on. Granted, Bucher executes them solidly enough, even tossing a few unexpected turns in there, such as diverting Riam from actually reaching the island, but it still felt overly familiar with little to make it stand out from other novels employing the same tropes.  The same is true with the prose style.  The world-building is thin; I can\u2019t say I really had a great sense of the land and its societies, but the mythology is intriguing if again a bit familiar. On the plus side, Bucher does a quite nice job with physical action, whether in the form of pitched battles, Riam\u2019s slave labor, or arduous journeying.<br /><br />\u201cSolidly comfortable\u201d is the best description I can go with for Lies of Descent. It goes down a well-trod path and doesn\u2019t really deviate enough (at least in book one) to make it stand out from other similar plots/characters, and its portrayal of female characters (not just Nola) unfortunately bends it in the wrong direction. At this point, therefore, I\u2019d hold off until seeing how book two goes.", "images": [], "asin": "B07KVLDQDQ", "parent_asin": "B07KVLDQDQ", "user_id": "AEJIPQY4UD6ZS2ATZPPUSQYEVSQA", "timestamp": 1677309306281, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I am excited if I love it and usually just sad or even indifferent if I don't. After all, you can't like them all. Well, this time I'm pissed off with this book. Really, really pissed off! In the Woods had all the makings of a 5 star, all-time favorite book, but those hopes crashed and burned about 2/3 in. Now I feel cheated, like a kid who was promised candy only to discover a piece of rock under all that bright glittering packaging.<br /><br />I realize that I'm not exactly an expert in this genre - I rarely read murder mysteries. I watch plenty of those on TV though. I had picked In the Woods because the premise seemed interesting: Three kids go to play in the woods. Only one of them is found the next morning, wearing bloody shoes and no memory of what happened. Twenty years later, that kid, now a detective in the murder squad, is forced to come back to this town to investigate the murder of another child in the same woods.<br /><br />Now my understanding of the murder mystery genre is that the author and the reader enter into an unspoken pact - if the reader sticks with the story, the author will reveal the mystery in the end. Most of the questions will be answered and the culprits found. The reader will know who had done it, why and how.<br /><br />The biggest mystery in this book is what happened to Peter and Jamie 20 years ago. The book even begins with that disappearance, and Katie's murder comes a few chapters later. So that's the mystery that should be resolved by the end, right?<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />By the time I was maybe 10 pages away from finishing the book, I had the sinking feeling that the author would not answer any of those questions. We will never find out what Rob saw in the woods that night or what became of Peter and Jamie. I had invested hours of my time to read through 400+ pages just to end up with the lukewarm explanation that &#34;some memories are just gone for good, and some mysteries are not meant to be solved.&#34;<br /><br />I realize that in real life that's what happens about 70% of the time. I mean, just look at the amount of cold cases gathering dust in police archives around the world. However, book logic is different. I don't want to get invested in a story that won't give me a resolution. I want to feel a sense of fulfillment after I finish a book, not to feel cheated and frustrated.<br /><br />I'm upset about this because the book has so much potential. It's wonderfully well-written. The prose is just beautiful, and some passages are just poignantly poetic. The protagonist has a strong and interesting voice that I wanted to follow. And his personal involvement with this place just made me want to finally find out what had happened on that fateful day 20 years ago even more\u2026 So I dived into the book head first and fully expected an exceptional read.<br /><br />The alarm bells first went off in my head when Rob decided not to come forward about his identity even when evidence found on the new crime scene linked it to the case of his missing friends. He chose to keep his mouth shut on the fact that Ryan Adams and detective Rob Adams were one and the same person and he reiterated this decision several times during the investigation. I find this decision stupid and irresponsible, because not only does it jeopardize his career, but the whole case as well, since all the evidence he collected will become inadmissible in court if the truth comes out. And his reasoning behind this decision makes less and less sense the further we get into the book.<br /><br />My second problem with In the Woods is Rob's partner Cassie. The way Tana French portrays her, she is &#34;saint&#34; Cassie who can do no wrong. She always has the right hunch about the case. She is smart and beautiful and has a keen understanding of people. Yet she chooses to stick with Rob no matter what he does. Even after that disastrous night, she isn't mad at him for the abject way he starts treating her, but because she lost his friendship and somehow she thinks it's her fault. Really? Hot, smart and sassy girl who is extremely devoted to her abusive boyfriend / friend. Hello trope!<br /><br />But even though I didn't like Cassie and had a tough time with some of Rob's decisions, the story would still have gotten a 4 star review if the author had kept her end of the bargain and actually given me and ending. The fact that it didn't happen was just the last nail in the coffin lid.<br /><br />I'm upset. I won't recommend this book. I had planned to read the next one in the Dublin Murder Squad series, but I have zero motivation to do that now.", "images": [], "asin": "0143113496", "parent_asin": "0143113496", "user_id": "AHQT3JAIHOGZUP7ADMFMYOCOGGMA", "timestamp": 1431113070000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 2, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

I just didn't like him, and since the whole story is from his POV, that was a problem from the start.

Her willingness to drop deep into her own grief and delineate its contours is courageous and inspiring.<br /><br />But as the book wore on -- and it is twice the length of the average memoir -- I found myself becoming disengaged.  The author's immense economic and cultural privilege, which she duly acknowledges, leads to occasional remarks that sat wrong with me.  The most striking example of this is when she writes that she and her husband not only paid a surrogate to carry a pregnancy, but also paid living expenses when one of the two people in the surrogacy family loses a job.  This comes after she and her husband had bought a house in the UK and paid for it for two years while still living and paying rent in Belgium, after a huge months-long remodeling project, after her husband got a year off work with pay when he moved from Belgium back to the UK, after a self-congratulatory description of how she and her husband decided to give away their excess wealth, after multiple rounds of IVF.  This lifted her experience far, far out of the realm of anything remotely connected to the ordinary, average woman, and this is the point where I began to feel that the memoir lost ground as some kind of attempt to speak for all women who have lost dearly wished for pregnancies and tried other arenas.<br /><br /> At one point she pretty explicitly questions whether the doctor who delivered her first stillborn, preterm baby deliberately killed it in some kind of internal wrenching movement.  This is a pretty gigantic statement, but she never follows up, either in terms of asking for an investigation or in writing about it.  It just lies there, a huge semi-indirect accusation.  I kept wondering whether the doctor could/would sue, whether the doctor had read a draft of the book and if so, what she had said.<br /><br />The lovely, delicate, sensory writing of the book's first half gradually felt as though it collapsed into a rushed chronicle of dates, events, persons in the last third in particular.  I ended up just skimming the last quarter of the memoir; I simply was not invested in her any longer.", "images": [], "asin": "1783521058", "parent_asin": "1783521058", "user_id": "AFSXD3DEC5WDNR5GTVMX7MLX72WA", "timestamp": 1657862889024, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 3, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 1, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

As the investigation deepens, Jimmy clashes with almost everyone in his life, including his girlfriend Adele, his colleagues, his boss, and his daughter.

Except for the mystery surrounding the identity of the baby and mother, this book is strictly a crime novel.  There are really no surprises, as it was clear where the author wanted to take the plot.  With so many people connected to Vega involved, the story had a measure of unbelievability to it.

{"rating": 2, "title": "Not the book I anticipated", "text": "Let me just say that if this was a stand alone novel and not part of a series, I would have liked it. But the fact that it was a highly anticipated 3rd book of a series that I loved AND made movies I loved I was sooo disappointed with the storyline.  This was not the fun, ridiculous but still well written chic-lit that the other two books were.  Forgive me b/c there will be spoiler alerts as I vent.  Helen Fielding, why mess with a formula that worked by adding a dark somber element to it which is not how these characters were built up.  Not only did you kill off my favorite character but you made his children so young when he died that they have no memory of him.  So cruel.  Though in reality I would like to be supportive of a woman learning to move forward, when that woman is Bridget moving forward from Mark, I WANTED HER TO GRIEVE HIM UNTIL SHE DIED. He was the ONLY man for her and you can build up Mr. Wallacker as some super hero, but he is no Mark Darcy.<br /><br />The only thing consistent in what I liked about this novel compared to the first two is that my favorite scenes were still anything with a mention of Mark.  Even though I had to keep putting the book down because I was so freakin sad.<br /><br />Also, its pretty upsetting that after all this time her friends have no emotional maturity.  With the exception of Shazzar who has seemed to have grown up, the rest of them were pathetic at times. Jude was the worst. And Daniel being the kids Godfather...NO WAY WOULD MARK HAVE ALLOWED THAT, EVEN IF THEY MADE AMENDS BEFORE HE DIED.<br /><br />Sigh..I just hope they agree for a screenplay that is not reflective of the book and shows the happy and humorous ending we all wanted for Mark and Bridget (with an awesome fight scene between Mark and Daniel). Life does not always turn out the way you wanted, I get it...but that's not the lesson I want from Bridget Jones Diary.

I think that if you like Slaughter's books you'll like this one.<br /><br />Overall, lead character Keye Street is interesting, well-developed and three-dimensional. An ex-alcoholic with a PhD, booted from the FBI for her drunken antics and now working as a PI.<br /><br />We're treated not only to her involvement in the investigation of a serial killer, but to some of her escapades as a PI and bail recovery agent. Some of these side trips were really interesting.<br /><br />The book moves along briskly and has plenty of action, as well as \"thriller\" overtones.<br /><br />But here's the one thing that kept popping up as a clinker repeatedly throughout the book: In author Williams's world, apparently the majority of people are either gay or bi-sexual. Or act like it, or are potentially so, or whatever.<br /><br />Now, I'd never heard of Williams before. As I've read some of the other reviews, I've learned that apparently she has a bibliography that was targeted towards a gay/lesbian audience, and published by a specialty house.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />But I gotta tell you, if I had to judge by this book, I'd have to guess that Atlanta must be the \"gayest\" city in the country. More than West Hollywood or Key West, apparently. It just got to the point that it was ridiculous. If she's going to write for the \"mainstream\", this is something she has to get away from. Yeah, there are gay people in all walks of life; and yeah, there are characters in mainstream novels who are gay, Milo Sturgis in the Alex Delaware novels coming immediately to mind; and yeah, they can be interesting and engaging characters. But books also have to reflect the reality of life, and the gay population is only about 2% in this country. That's about one in fifty, not the huge percentage we see in this book.

The two main characters are a couple of teenage misfits: one a computer nerd comic book geek boy, and the other a goth girl, and what more do I really need to say about that?  They both hate the world, and in the beginning it felt like this audiobook was headed down a very disturbing path, a Columbine-type situation at the least.  Let me ease your fears, nothing like that happens.  I'm willing to reveal that much because for a while I seriously considered dropping this book because of that.  The audiobook still has its disturbing aspects however.<br /><br />Fanboy lives with his mom and her new husband, \"the step-fascist\", who are expecting a baby soon, and his father has been growing more and more distant as the years pass.  Meanwhile, he has exactly one friend in the world, a friend who is becoming a popular athlete and will probably move on pretty soon.  Fanboy has developed the creepy habit of carrying a bullet in his pocket.  Whenever people start to bother him, he grasps it and it calms him, like a security blanket.  Goth Girl's mother died a few years back and she now lives alone with her father.  Since her mother's death, she just doesn't know how to cope with the world.<br /><br />Here are a couple of kids who desperately need someone.  The problem is that they both lost people they loved and trusted, and to avoid that hurt again, they push people away.  It's very sad seeing how these two react to their own personal traumas, and there are a couple of scenes in particular that are just heart-breaking.  Fanboy is excited about meeting his hero, comic book creator Brian Michael Bendis, at an upcoming convention, and showing Bendis the graphic novel he's been working on.  Fanboy gets nervous at the meeting and everything goes wrong, so Fanboy rushes into a restroom, looks in the mirror and shouts at himself, \"What did you do?  What did you do!\"  Later on, Fanboy and Goth Girl clearly like each other, but Kyra still fears being rejected.  She mentions Deena Jurgens, the most beautiful girl in school, and breaks down, crying, \"...because she's perfect, and I'm broken.\"  That's just sad.<br /><br />Who exactly is Fanboy?  I was about halfway through this audiobook when I realized that I didn't know Fanboy's real name.  The only reference I could remember was one time during his interior dialogue, he mentioned a time when his mom called him Donny, and how he hated it when she called him that.  After this realization, I started paying particular attention, waiting for someone to say his name, but it never happened.  It would always be something like, \"The teacher called out my name,\" or \"He asked me my name, and I said `as if'.\"  I have to assume that Barry Lyga deliberately avoided using Fanboy's name.  I guess that's to show us how the people at school didn't really see Fanboy as an actual person, and Fanboy always saw himself as less interesting and less important than everyone else.<br /><br />The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl was narrated by Scott Brick.  As I have mentioned before, I don't care for Brick's narrations.  He just doesn't sound natural to me, always either overly dramatic, or not dramatic enough.  When he reads dialogue, it doesn't sound like real people talking, it just sounds like Scott Brick reading a book.<br /><br />This wasn't a bad audiobook at all.  If I was to classify it, I guess I would call it a \"coming-of-age\" story.  Fanboy learns some important lessons about life and love, and you can sense him beginning to grow and mature.  With a different narrator, this audiobook probably could have been something special.", "images": [], "asin": "0739339044", "parent_asin": "0739339044", "user_id": "AGUZTAHWOMETRT2JTITUPJET2LQQ", "timestamp": 1371993267000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false, "label1": 4, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

But the thoughtful fantasy elements are pushed to their utmost, from Triss's captivating point of view to the satisfying resolution. Character growth is overly delineated (the perhaps inevitable drawback of middle grade), but sincere and rewarding. Hardinge has a lovely voice, analogy-heavy but also precise and evocative.

{"rating": 3, "title": "\"Well, This Is Tense\" - a little uneven, but a very uniquely themed anthology", "text": "Crawling Back (by Allison Wall) - 3/5<br />Connections between parents and children. What would someone do in order to start over? How far back would you be willing to go?<br />This was a quietly creepy story. It becomes darker when you start to wonder just how many times the main character has 'gone back' to try and be better.<br /><br />Neon Monkey (by Oli Jacobs) - 5/5<br />A meaningless job. An endless and confusing set of routines. Waking up to strange situations over and over, each time where something doesn't quite make sense.<br />I love stories that manage to be unsettling. It's easy to scare a reader, but it's much harder to create a 'nightmare fuel' type of story.<br /><br />Now You See It Clear (by Mathew Gostelow) - 2/5<br />There's some beautiful and grotesque imagery here, but I just didn't connect with the whole 'addiction as a literal monster' analogy. If the source of the son's sickness was kept more ambiguous, it would have worked better.<br /><br />Rebirth (by Chrissie Rohrman) - 2/5<br />This story reminded me of Mike Flanagan's Oculus, where a mysterious mirror affects everyone around it. This story about an entity trapped behind a suburban woman's newly purchased mirror, felt similar. I thought this started off strong, but the ending was a little cliche. I also didn't like that this story didn't stick to the theme of the anthology, and was a mix of first and second person narration.<br /><br />The Sixth Floor (by Stephanie Kvellestad) - 5/5<br />Starting a new job can be stressful. People's names and faces to remember, layout of the new office,etc. A simple trip to the sixth floor of a new office building shouldn't be too hard of a task, right?<br />I loved how well the narrative showed the quiet desperation of the main character, who tries to remain calm and use logic despite things obviously being very very wrong around her.<br /><br />Electric Piano (by Lisha Goldberg) - 5/5<br />There was SO MUCH tension in this short little story! It takes real talent to make a piano performance feel so dramatic and full of action. Plus, I loved the little bits of dark humor sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />Mirror Image (by Priscilla Kint) - 3/5<br />A winding down party. A fellow party goer offering a ride back home. The driver keeps glancing back, but the main character can't quite see what it is.<br />This story builds up a sense of dread well, and I was hoping for a suitably creepy ending to match the mood set up in the beginning. Not going to spoil it, but the revelation and the end was too cliche for me.<br /><br />Hunger (by Shelby Catalano) - 2/5<br />It's a little hard to grasp what this was about. The prose had too much overwriting for me, and other than some darkly poetic imagery, nothing really happens in this. Hunger and internal emptiness are central themes, but there's no character growth/development, and that diminished some of the impact for me.<br /><br />Mother Of Worms (by Rae Knowles) - 2/5<br />A woman trapped in a locked shed by someone (a boyfriend, a husband?). She's unable to escape, she's growing hungry, and has resorted to trying to eat dirt.<br />Once again, the writing was a little clunky and I couldn't fully be immersed in the story. I give it points for some truly dark/poetic imagery, but the ending felt unsatisfying.<br /><br />Gryllidae (by Phil Ford) - 2/5<br />This begins with some promise, as the author builds a quickly growing sense of unease amid a seemingly idyllic life of an elderly couple. The story's main focus on grief and loss of a spouse held promise, but the ending with its dark figure in a cloak was too cliche for me.<br /><br />The Well (by N. Miller) - 3/5<br />A rumor of possible ghosts at a local well. One girl agrees to come along with her friend, even though she's uneasy. Something is off about the well, and about the way it reflects people.<br />This started off as a good urban legend-inspired story, but had a pretty weak ending.<br /><br />Love Bites (by Marissa Snyder) - 3/5<br />A happy bride, a charming wedding. Then, mysterious bites on her body start to appear. They keep coming back no matter what remedy is suggested. Nothing seems to work to make them go away.<br />This was written in a very lyrical, fairy tale-like way, and I loved it. I felt there was no real end though. At the most interesting and exciting part of the story, the narrative just abruptly ended. Ultimately not very satisfying.<br /><br />Each Minute Closer (by Brianne Battye) - 2/5<br />A set of routines in a person's life repeats. Each day it happens over and over again with no variation. Until the day that little glitches, little creepy changes start trickling in.<br />Once again, a story had a very strong start, and it made me want to keep reading. The ending could have been much stronger.<br /><br />Do Not Open Under Any Circumstances (by Tiffany Michelle Brown) - 3/5<br />A mysterious box is delivered to an office, seeming by no one. A warning is written on the box, never to open it. What will happen when the main character gives in to that sense of curiosity?<br />This had a good start and a terrifying moment (the whole bathroom encounter is amazing), but the ending was very typically cliche, with the whole message of 'one bad decision equals horrible torment for the protagonist'.<br /><br />Teeth (by Tanya Pell) - 5/5<br />A house with an unending amount of rooms. They seem to go on and on. Not enough windows or doors, so easy to get lost forever. A lost girl full of fear and nightmares tries to escape, but is lost in the maze of the house.<br />This read like a very dark fairytale, and I absolutely loved it. Ever think about those missing women from old fairy tales, those former wives of princes or kings? This story is like a glimpse of what happened to some of those women.<br /><br />Sinkhole (by Paul Lonardo) - 2/5<br />A man wakes up in what looks like a typical sinkhole. It should be relatively easy to climb out, and go back to his normal life. What if the sinkhole is something more, and he's very very far from home?<br />This was a boring story for me. There was an opportunity to better describe the strange landscape the man finds himself in, but it wasn't done. The story ended at a seemingly random point, and felt overall unsatisfying.<br /><br />Doppelganger (by Stuart Hardy) - 3/5<br />The most body horror like story of the collection so far! Starts off really good, and you're never 100% sure of what's happening to the main character. Is it all just a very intense heart attack, or the cause something more sinister? The ending is kind of a letdown, since it's cheesiness doesn't match the dark tone of most of the story.<br /><br />Itch (by Deborah Tapper) - 5/5<br />What starts off as a mere itch, turns into something more. Much,much more. This was an uncomfortable but amazing read. So many ways to interpret what was happening. Was it a delusion, or was the cause more grounded in reality? Ending is pretty dark, and the story ends strong.<br /><br />Seeds (by Dorian J. Sinnott) - 5/5<br />Set in a world where monsters are very much real, and what might pass of as superstition is very much a tool to ward off evil.  This felt like another dark fairy tale-inspired story, and I loved the strong familial bond between our main characters.<br /><br />Your Veins Full Of Water (by J.R. Santos) - 5/5<br />At the beginning, I thought this would be a story mostly focused on hauntings, but nope. This turned weird fast, and it was simply amazing. Without revealing too much, the scope is a little cosmic, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Conviction (by Justin Oldham) - 2/5<br />A prisoner goes through the motions of his day, knowing that his execution date is fast approaching. He reiterates and reassures himself that what he did was right and necessary.<br />This was so frustrating to read. Written well, but not a single bit of info is given about what the prisoner did. He says multiple times his convictions were true, but we never find out what they are.<br /><br />Cross Your Heart (by Die Booth) - 3/5<br />One fake online listing after another. Until something real comes up. A box that just might be really cursed.<br />This story ended too abruptly for me (probably could have used another page or so to develop more), but I'll give it points for surprising me at the end.<br /><br />Escape Path (by Rachel L. Tilley) - 2/5<br />Similar to the \"Conviction\" story a few pages back, this one's focus is also very narrow. It involves a woman trying to survive a treacherous trip in horrible weather. There are zero hents as to what she's trying to escape. I don't think that readers need to be spoon-fed explanations, but there's zero hints as to what's going on.<br /><br />You Want To Be Buried (by Taylor Grothe) - 5/5<br />A passionate dance at a party. A request made half-heartedly. What does it mean to not fully understand a promise?<br />This was such a darkly romantic and melancholy little story. I could tell the ending coming from the beginning, but it didn't matter since this was so well written. So good.<br /><br />We Are All Monsters To Our Mothers Someday (by Emmy Teague) - 2/5<br />The writing was fine, but I didn't connect with this story at all. Like the \"Now You See It Clear\" story earlier in the anthology, the metaphor used (grown up children seeming alien and incomprehensible to their parents) was clunky. If it was more subtle, I think the story would have been more scary/creepy/etc.<br /><br />Dreams Of Trees (by Patricia Miller) - 3/5<br />A man becomes newly rich due to an inheritance, and immediately starts thinking of how to use the family land to his financial advantage. He's so focused on progress and profit that he ignores the warnings given to him. Don't go into the woods, it is dangerous,etc,etc.<br />The main character was too much of a 'rich, spoiled guy' cliche to connect to. The ending has some good moments, but not enough to rate this higher.<br /><br />You Have No Internet At Home (by Zary Fekete) - 2/5<br />This starts off as a story of a man waiting to hear back (through e-mail) from his girlfriend. He has proposed to his girlfriend, but there hasn't been a reply from her for days.<br />Don't want to spoil this any further, but the story feels incomplete. The ending is abrupt, feels like it belongs from a different story. Not a satisfying read.<br /><br />Roxie and Ericka (by Ann Wuehler) - 2/5<br />This was written as a constantly shifting mix of first- and second-person narration. The structure of the story (a girl experiencing the drowning of her twin sister) was very jumbled as a result, and so confusing. It was lyrical at times and had some cool imagery, but overall was just muddled.<br /><br />Check This Out! (by Gully Novaro) - 5/5<br />What starts off as a camping story (making a fire, enduring goofy dad questions,etc), quickly goes very wrong. The creature in the woods that is after the main character (and her father) is truly unnerving. The mystery around it works to build up constant fear. I thought this would be a typical 'monster kills everyone in the woods' narrative, but...nope. This is strange, and sad, and very dark.<br /><br />Komodo My Desk (by bdyer) - 3/5<br />A graphic online video. A compulsion to watch it over and over again. Office politics, with its constant mix of personalities fighting each other. There's a little bit of the creepiness of the haunted video from the Ringu film franchise, but this is much more bizarre in tone. I honestly couldn't tell what was real or a hallucination of the main character (a typical office drone).

{"rating": 3, "title": "Partnoy's still complaining", "text": "Frank Partnoy, author of this book and the very silly 'FIASCO: Blood in the Water on Wall Street', implies an illustrious career structuring and selling complex derivatives. In actual fact he worked on Wall Street for just two years in total, straight out of college. Instead of succeeding by staying the course, Partnoy made his millions by violating the Wall Street code of omerta and knocking out a sensationalist, mostly ignorant, account of the year or so he spent at Morgan Stanley. Infectious Greed is the follow-up, which purports to document the wreckage across the market since.<br /><br /> Having read FIASCO, which was valuable mostly for its unintended humour, I didn't expect much of Infectious Greed; I was rather looking forward to slating it, to be honest. It has the same air of maiden-aunt prurience as FIASCO but, almost despite himself, Partnoy's conclusions here aren't especially objectionable, and mostly undermine the tone of studied outrage he cultivates throughout the early part of the book.<br /><br /> The thesis of the book is that the financial markets have, of late, been corrupted by deceit and risk (hang on a minute: financial markets are *about* risk. Is it meaningful to say they can they be corrupted by it?). Yet at least half the book recounts events which took place ten or more years ago, in the primordial soup of the derivatives market. If a week is a long time in politics, a decade is an aeon on Wall Street: in 2004, the exploits of Bankers Trust and CS First Boston in 1993 aren't exactly current. The nascent derivatives market is now a mature trillion dollar industry. I dare say Professor Partnoy wouldn't recognise it.<br /><br /> Partnoy's explanations of the transactions are, however, lucid: so much so that they undo his conclusions. At one point he describes in two paragraphs the 'whipsaw' risk of an 'Inverse IO' instrument. It's a very clear explanation, which completely undermines his concluding observation that 'it was unclear whether any mutual-fund mangers [the investors] understood all of this'. Here's the thing: to put not too fine a point on it, a professional fund manager who doesn't understand what can be lucidly explained in eight sentences, yet still invests in it, should be shot. So should his employer. And neither deserves the respect (for which, read, money) of the public. It might seem a harsh lesson, but it wouldn't take too many collapses to shake the mums and dads in Ohio out of their complacent stupor and shift their funds to a manager who was prepared to employ qualified managers and supervise them properly. The market has a way of teaching people valuable lessons that market regulation and government bail-outs really don't.<br /><br /> The funny thing is, Partnoy does continually stumble over this axiom, but doesn't recognise it. He quotes a Peat Marwick partner who derides ignorant fund managers thus: 'if you don't understand, you might as well place it all on red at Atlantic City or Las Vegas, because at least there you get free drinks.' Though Partnoy doesn't think so, the analogy is a good one: the very monied nature of Wall Street is the most graphic illustration of the fact that, unless you really know your onions, you are NOT going to end up a winner. The house is; which is why most of them can afford to pay their 20,000+ employees salaries which average out at half a million dollars each (it's all in the annual report - do the sums!). Like Casinos, Wall Street trading desks have a motive ulterior to realising some poor schmuck's American dream: the object is to make, not lose, money, and this is exactly what they do and a statistically constant basis.<br /><br /> Partnoy repeatedly calls for regulation of the derivatives market without ever making a case for how this might be done or how it would prevent the losses he documents in the book: criminal statutes don't stop people committing murder, after all. All the regulation in the world won't stop fraudsters (if they're committing fraud, then by definition the regulations are already there, and they're breaking them). On the other hand, exploring the idiosyncrasies of rules *without* breaking them is the prerogative of every citizen, not just Wall Street banks. After all, regulatory arbitrage is only possible because of prescribed regulatory rules tend not to precisely reflect economic reality. If rules have irrational boundaries, then it is economically rational to exploit them.<br /><br /> Eventually, Partnoy acknowledges this. He cannot ultimately muster much venom for the perpetrators of the Enron debacle, and by the epilogue, where he sets out his recommendations (full marks to him for putting his money where is mouth is, by the way: it's one thing to criticise; quite another to suggest a solution) his proposals don't include regulation of the wholesale derivatives market (&quot;some derivatives markets might appropriately have been left unregulated&quot; he concedes) but simply equivalent accounting treatment with comparable financial instruments, and most of his fire is reserved not for Wall Street traders or greedy executives, but the credit rating agencies which operate under the umbrella of a government-sponsored oligopoly (only Moody's, Fitch and S&P are recognised for regulatory purposes). And you'll never guess what his solution is for dealing with the rating agencies: Without a hint of irony, he suggests they be deregulated!<br /><br /> By the final sentence of the book, it seems the most elementary elements of market theory may have finally slipped through: Partnoy asks his readers whether they have taken any prudent steps to properly evaluate their investments before putting up any money: 'If you answered 'no,' you have one more person to blame in addition to the accountants, bankers, lawyers, credit raters, corporate executives, directors and regulators who failed to spot the various financial schemes of recent years. You.'<br /><br /> Not, in the final analysis, quite the damning indictment it cracked up to be, then.<br /><br /> Olly Buxton", "images": [], "asin": "0805075100", "parent_asin": "0805075100", "user_id": "AF66ND32K77EQRRC7M6VKZEW2SQQ", "timestamp": 1075166708000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 5, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 2, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}

{"rating": 3, "title": "3 Stars for Glitch By: Heather Anastasiu", "text": "Glitch by author Heather Anastasiu is the first installment in the trilogy bearing the same name.<br /><br />The people, (if you can still call them that) live underground in a suppressed and highly controlled society. Everything is regulated and there are no emotions. Everyone is \"Linked\" into a network from the beginning where everyone is stripped free from their humanity. They are 100% controlled, from where they live, who they marry and have kids with, to what they eat. It's a sad, sad life to be forced into. But what if that's the life that was chosen by the people who came before you? And what if there was a chance you could break free? What if it's a malfunction, or as they call them \"Glitch\" that makes you an anomaly?<br /><br />These are the questions few people have to face in this world. It's scary to be an anomaly when everyone is programmed to report you. Zoe is terrified when she starts to glitch. I couldn't even imagine being a teen and having that huge flood of emotions come rushing at you. Things you have no idea what they are, or why you are feeling the way that you do. And then on top of it to also find out you have an even bigger secret you don't want getting out... It would be such a whirlwind to me; I wouldn't know how to react.<br /><br />So, first things first... I'd like to say that I've been DYING to read this book for months now. The whole idea about people living this way, people that are more or less cyborgs, which they are never called by the way. I just had to know more. I liked the story, felt eh about the characters, but I could see such potential, more at the end of the book with the twists and turns than my initial reaction at the beginning.<br /><br />I felt the characters were a bit off. Yet, while I was reading I had to remind myself that while they were teens, they were teens who had never felt any types of emotions before. In a sense they were younger in age emotionally then they appeared physically. They were pretty juvenile to say the least. Even Adrien was odd. He felt so much older and wiser then his teen years too. It was such a stark contrast that made me have to remind myself that they both came from such different places and was raised so differently that they would be like night and day. Yet, it just didn't feel right.<br /><br />The whole insta-love didn't work for me at all. For Zoe, just learning what all these emotions she's feeling are, I can't see anyone in her position just jumping straight into falling in love with someone. I thought of her being more cautious as she was with Max.<br /><br />Speaking of Max, he creeped me out! Did anyone else feel this way about him?<br /><br />The writing was okay. Again, I felt that the best part was the last quarter of the book. I liked the twists and turns and felt that those were key points in the story for me. I liked the twist with Molla as well and I'm eager to see how her story line plays out. I just hope that Anastasiu gives us more of her in the next installment.<br /><br />All in all, I found things that were okay and while I could see reasons for things happening throughout the story and the characters, I was left a little flat while reading. It just didn't blow me away as I was thinking it would. I am glad that I did read it for that last part of the book, which has made me eager to read the next one to see what happens further on into the story, which is important when reading a beginning of a trilogy.

{"rating": 3, "title": "Not happy with this book at all", "text": "So...to say I am disappointed with this book is a vast understatement, to say the least.<br /><br />*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!! ***<br /><br />First and foremost, this story line seems to be plucked from her rear end. Whether she intended all along to add something like this to the Green Rider series, or if it was some misguided whim, will remain a mystery. However, I think it was a mistake on her part because, as for myself, it detracted from the overall series and the type of world that had been so meticulously built over the first 4 books.<br /><br />I do not care that Karigan was propelled into the future, for as we've read in the other books, she has occasionally traversed through layers of time. But to base 90% of the book in a futuristic, steampunk world, with none of the previous characters we've come to know and love in sight was idiotic. Pretty much, this book almost could have been a stand alone unrelated to the Green Rider series other than a few touches here and there.<br /><br />Yes, we get glimpses into the &#34;present&#34; time, the time Karigan lived in, as to keep slightly, though barely, updated on what's going on in our beloved Green Rider world.<br /><br />Many characters, as well, seemed half baked. And when I say many, I mean most. The professor, though more thought out, was essentially only good for a place to stay. He was rarely around, and then only when he served the purpose of introducing Karigan to other characters. Miriam, Lorine, Luke, Silk, even Arhys, were there just to have regular interactions. With the exception of Silk, none truly led to moving the story along, and even Silk very little. Lhean was even pointless. Why bring him into the future with her? He didn't have any significant part until the end, which even then was minimal in only helping Karigan with the riddle and to light the moonstones.<br /><br />Amberhill...dear gods, what can I say. He is not even actively in the story until the very, very end and, yet again, not enough to notice. In previous books, seeing as how Amberhill was mostly pointless in regards to the story as a whole, I was curious to see what her motivations were to keeping him in the series at all. Though I never had a particular aversion to Amberhill before, I have to say I'm extremely disappointed if this is what she had in mind all along. I know the following books will most likely fill in the gaps as to what happened to Amberhill between the past and the future, but Mornhaven has been the primary evil in the whole series. Yes, I know he resides in Amberhill, but even that seemed half baked. Oh yes, we'll just keep Mornhaven in the story somewhere, just so no one will gripe about this book being such a stretch from the others. For the big, bad villain to change so suddenly didn't help the overall underwhelming story line for this book.<br /><br />Now on to Cade. Though a generally likable character, seemingly more thought out than the rest, was a stretch for me as well. It mostly seemed he was put there simply to take attention away from the Zachary/Karigan romance that had been building in the previous books. Why? After all this time, why would you try to weaken that relationship? I'm not even one of those girls that need some sort of romantic relationship to exist in a book to enjoy it. But in this series, after all the hardships and loss Karigan has faced, as well as more to look forward to in the future, the little kernel of light at the end of the tunnel for readers was her and King Zachary. That somehow, against all odds, she would get to be happy, as well as Zachary, in return for all the darkness that was endured. But, from things I've picked up on at the end of this book, I don't have high hopes at all of there being a future relationship of any kind with King Zachary. It has been suddenly, and brutally, cut off with no apparent reason.<br /><br />And, something that pisses me off in any book because it is utterly unrealistic and believable, is when the heroine falls madly in love with a guy in 2.5 days! Which is generally what happened with Cade. After only a few weeks of knowing one another, they fall in love, have sex, and would have possibly produced a child had she stayed. For a girl who had never previously displayed such idiotic, girly characteristics before, and who had been madly, unyieldingly in love with Zachary, she did a complete 180! It further ruined my enjoyment of the book, as well as any hope of redemption for future books.<br /><br />Karigan also pissed me off. What happened to the stubborn, strong willed girl with tons of fight in her? Oh sure, on occasion those attributes would show themselves, but almost more as an afterthought from the author, who seemed more determined to turn her into a pathetic, weak, helpless damsel in distress. And she was so blatantly stupid at times, it hurt to read. Apparently wit and intelligence, determination and cunning, were also scrapped along with other personality traits when writing this book.<br /><br />It's not as if Mrs. Britain is known for her speedy book releases, and I would have gladly waited for *additional* years to get a book that actually held anything I loved from the previous books, something that actually made more sense to the series.<br /><br />In general, the writing is not bad, and is as well written as her others on a basic level. Had this been an unrelated stand alone, I probably could have enjoyed it more. But as for its relevance to the Green Rider series....alas I feel I wasted years much anticipating this book just to be b*tch slapped by the author instead.<br /><br />I will stick with the series, but after this book, I have to say I am more likely to dread the release of the 6th book instead of anticipating it... :-(", "images": [], "asin": "B00FX7RFL2", "parent_asin": "B00FX7RFL2", "user_id": "AHLNAPY5GM2B2BIAEZXXGVPBQ3KQ", "timestamp": 1415992368000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true, "label1": 2, "source1": "labelled_output_liyuan.jsonl", "label2": 0, "source2": "labelled_output_tabularisai.jsonl"}
