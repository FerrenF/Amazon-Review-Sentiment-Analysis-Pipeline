{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Astonishing costumes", "text": "Phyllis Galembo is to be celebrated for her superlative photos of African costumery, thereby showing us the fantastic, fabulous, imaginative genius of the people she photographs. I'm in awe of such creativity. I must say, though, that the book was a disappointment. Its production did not live up to its subject. The photos themselves are fine - although I did expect a somewhat larger format, but there is something flat & ordinary about the dust jacket; the white background, the lack-luster font, in fact the general design, but, more important to me, is the inconsistent photo display. Some pages have photos on each side, most have photos on one side, with a blank reverse side. Its unprofessional appearance cheapens the presentation and gives the impression that the publisher wanted to make the book thicker than (to my mind) it should rightfully be.<br />This is simply to forewarn, not to discourage, would-be buyers. The costumes are delightful, inventive, utterly wonderful. In spite of my somewhat serious quibbles with the production of the book, I'm still glad to have it.", "images": [], "asin": "1905712170", "parent_asin": "1905712170", "user_id": "AE7XWRB4WHER4JLMODKZ4TNUFGQQ", "timestamp": 1353008888000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "We Gotta Get Out of This Place", "text": "This is a side of the Beatles that I didn't know much about -- the business side. After their first manager, Brian Epstein, died, they needed a new manager and how. Their finances were in a mess and none of them had any idea how to deal with money. At least the Rolling Stones had grown up in middle class families and Mick Jagger had even attended the London School of Economics for a year, so they were a tiny bit less unprepared for sudden wealth. Allen Klein, a New York accountant who had made a career representing American singers such as Sam Cooke and Bobby Vinton, was extremely ambitious and convinced the Stones that he'd get them more money, lots of it. He followed through, so the Beatles were interested. Paul McCartney was wary though, and with good reason. Klein was an operator and while he did get more money for his clients, he made sure he did all right too. Somehow he had ended up with the rights to all of Sam Cooke's songs and made questionable tax shelters for his clients.<br /><br />Author Fred Goodman goes into great detail about the angles Klein was playing and sometimes it gets a bit convoluted, but that's the way Klein liked it. Lots of celebrities and gossip here, but mostly business ins and outs and to be honest, I had to skim it in places just to get through. Nice look at a different take on The Beatles though, and no one comes out of it looking good.", "images": [], "asin": "0547896867", "parent_asin": "0547896867", "user_id": "AHROIP3MOAESZ2GHJ4PWLTXIYBBQ", "timestamp": 1433714228000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

There wasn't any way of pleasing her unbearable Father.  When she couldn't stand it at home any longer she moved in with her Grandmother Leah and works in her Grandmother's shop called Stitches in Time.  Mary Katherine loves her life working in her Grandmother's shop.  She also loves to weave and enjoys coming up with her own designs using textures of cotton, wool, and silk.<br /><br />Mary Katherine's cousins Naomi and Anna works in her Grandmother's shop too.  It seems like one happy family.  She feels the love from her Grandmother and cousins that she doesn't feel at home.<br /><br />Jacob has been a friend of Mary Katherine's for a long time.  Jacob wants more than friendship and hopes to court her.  Mary Katherine has told Jacob she isn't interested in being anything but friends.<br /><br />Daniel, a long time school friend of Mary Katherine's and Jacob's, has come back to Paradise to sell the family farm.  Daniel's family decided to move to Pinecraft, Florida several years ago.  Daniel too shows an interest in Mary Katherine and urges her to come visit him in Florida.<br /><br />To the dismay of her parents and grandmother Mary Katherine hasn't joined the church yet.  Her heart is restless and she doesn't know where she belongs.  Does she have enough faith in God to trust Him?<br /><br />Will Mary Katherine leave her Amish upbringing and move toward the English world?  Will she go visit Daniel and his family in Florida and end up staying there?  Will she fall in love with Jacob and join the church?  What will Mary Katherine do to calm her restless heart?<br /><br />The author takes us through the private life of Mary Katherine and her parents.  She shows us a side to Amish families that other Amish fiction authors might not.  We are taken into the real life of what happens and does happen in some relationships.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This Author Has So Much To Offer", "text": "It's hard not to fall into the alternate universes that Mike Chinakos has dreamt this time around.  Make way and make time for these stories.  While I have read his two previous novels of Hollywood Cowboys and Kiss of the Traitor, his writing style demanded my attention to explore this short story compilation.  This series of shorts follows a universe set in motion by a character named John Wayfinder who puts the reader in the near and far futures of humanity following an alien event.  Nearly all of the stories overlap in some branched way and somehow are all connected into exploring a unique idea of becoming \"unstuck\" in the universe; a premise that a single person can move forward and backward through time along a created universe, to recruit an unlikely team to rid the timeline of his own mistake.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Powerful, Candid, Fast-Paced Thriller. A Must Read.", "text": "Wow-wow-wow. Angeline Boulley's Firekeeper's Daughter is a fantastic debut.<br /><br />But if you only talk about it as a YA thriller, you\u2019re missing half the book. That\u2019s just the plot. Yes,  Daunis is an 18-year old biracial Anishinaabe woman gets who pulled into an FBI investigation into the drug trade in her community and falls for the new guy on her brother\u2019s hockey team. She\u2019s a solid hockey player in her own right and a science nerd.<br /><br />But within that story, Angeline Boulley's debut paints a vivid picture of what it is to be a biracial Native American woman. With Daunis, we get a clear sense of how her Anishinaabe culture, traditions, and community ground her daily life; how she balances and code switches between her white and Nish families; and how she's torn between heading to college, but knowing she has a responsibility to her family and community. As a biracial person, it\u2019s incredibly relatable.<br /><br />A fast-paced thriller and a thoughtful coming of age story, Firekeeper's Daughter is a love letter to Anishinaabe traditions and the power of community. But in it, Boulley also lays bare the long-term impacts of colonization; racism and bigotry; politics within indigenous communities; the way the federal government\u2019s actions have contributed to corruption and the meth epidemic, and relegated indigenous communities, especially their women, to second, even third-class citizen status.<br /><br />FIrekeeper's Daughter is powerful and candid with rich characters and a compelling case to unravel.

They occasionally cross paths, but she always avoids him. Determined, Scott sets out to make Alexis his, once and for all.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. I enjoyed the first book in the Megalodon Team series and hoped this one would be as good if not better. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. I found Alexis to be frustrating, childish and annoying. The one bright spot in the book was Scott. He was so loving, passionate, protective and all around great. With all of those wonderful attributes, Alexis just refused to believe that Scott loved her, wanted to be with her AND was only interested in her. It was okay for her to hear bits and pieces of conversations and jump to conclusions, but the one moment he did, it was a catastrophic event with her storming away and leaving him to berate himself.<br /><br />So often throughout this book, I hoped Scott would just stop pursuing Alexis and find a woman who wasn't so fickle and flighty; one who could actually return his feelings without a bunch of games and back and forth struggle. I understood that their jobs within the Navy and their rankings were an issue, but Alexis took it to the extreme. I wanted to scream when she would continue to address Scott as 'Commander' even though he practically begged her to call him by his first name. I took that as a way for her to not only put up a wall, but also as an unnecessary show of power over him to let him know that she wasn't going to succumb to his affections.<br /><br />I will try to read the next book in the series. Hopefully it will be better, but I already sense a pattern with these books - SEAL falls madly in love with woman, woman rebuffs his advances, man refuses to stop, woman gives in and develops feelings, woman hears tail end of a conversation and thinks man is in love with another woman, and man has to regain her trust and love.

With so many of the teens now concerned about the environment and war, activities that highlight the Orange/GREEN transition has been key to their classroom experience.

The frat boy perspective gives it a fresh viewpoint and makes it really relatable because this guy is so normal and not perfect and not all harmonious & pious after death. Like Lord Vishnu, you have no idea where this book is going to go and you can't put the book down. I also liked learning about the inner workings of fraternity rituals which I've always wondered about, hence The Skulls reference above.

This book started with Elizabeth Lyons finding her boyfriend cheating on her with her roommate at the time. Of course, the guy Ben was a jerk and made it like it was Elizabeth's fault as she was ambitious and heartless, and no guy liked that.  Fast forward eight years and Elizabeth is still a hardworking female, and she has made a name for herself in the production business which for females is hard including a young one like herself. She is awarded the honor of being one of the Thirty under thirty to look out for and heads to a party where she meets Daniel Alexander. He wants her, and she doesn't want the hassle of a relationship. Can Daniel find his romance bone to woo Elizabeth as she's not like the ones he has had before and will drop her panties on the first date?

Although I love reading them, a cookbook has to be not only beautiful, interesting and unique, it has to be useful for real people, real home cooks (like me) in real kitchens, feeding real families and friends. On all accounts, this beautiful book from accomplished chef and food writer Rozanne Gold is a winner.<br /><br />First things first, the book itself--and this is so important for a cookbook--is easy to read and use. The binding is high quality and the typeface and layout are easy and comfortable to read, and there are beautiful photos for almost every recipe. The book will lie open flat so you can cook from it without fumbling.<br /><br />The recipes are wonderful--innovative without that tedious \"I'm trying too hard here to come up with something new and different!\" feeling in so many newer cookbooks. The recipes are geared toward quick preparation (15 minutes, 30 minutes) using fresh and simple whole foods, and even a few simple convenience foods, like canned beans and chickpeas, frozen peas and Dijon mustard. Fabulous.<br /><br />I cannot wait to try: \"Almost Confit\" Chicken with Melted Garlic, Pork Chops and Apples with Madeira-Bay Butter Sauce, A New Way to Cook Broccoli: Charred & Tossed With Chilies and Garlic, Spiced Salmon on a Moroccan Salad...oh, heck, I think I may just start at \"Bloody\" Shrimp Cocktail and work my through to Double Raspberry Sorbet.<br /><br />Recommendation: Excellent addition to a home cook's bookshelf.", "images": [], "asin": "1605294705", "parent_asin": "1605294705", "user_id": "AHLKUGG2Z4M5V6FEHNQUV43QHC4Q", "timestamp": 1288270124000, "helpful_vote": 60, "verified_purchase": false}

Most of it is bleak and raw. I'm happy to discover what I think is a very talented author and look forward to reading more of her work.<br />Many years ago, Susan's little brother died while in her care. The guilt from his death continues to rule her life even when she has her own little boy to mother. Shockingly, the tragedy happened when she was only seven and her little brother almost five. A seven year old shouldn't even be left alone to care for themselves, let alone for another. Who is to blame, the child who took mothers pills? The slightly older sister watching him? Or the parents, the father who was working and left them in the care of the unstable mother who left her children alone to go out with another man? Little Mark was the clear favorite child of them both and with him gone, Susan suffers even more than she had before.  When she's grown and has a child of her own, she fears she'll hurt him and is too anxious to mother him in most any way. If she can't face her demons, she'll lose everything.<br />I love books that just seem to flow.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pretty kickass.", "text": "Violent is really not the right word for this spare-no-detail fantasy monstrosity. Insane? Maybe. Really, the only way to describe Remic's Kell's Legend is with a phrase: a bloody, violent, fantastic journey through carnage, terror, and a downright epic tale that makes Underworld and every zombie movie look bad. That sounds about right.<br /><br />Kell's Legend is the first is Remic's Clockwork Vampire Chronicles. It follows Kell, a legendary warrior who has grown old, and a number of other characters, from his granddaughter Nienna to Anukis, a clockwork vampire-turned-exile in her own homeland. When strange, twisted albino soldiers descend upon the city of Jalder, Kell must take up his axe once again to defend his family. But with that action comes a flood of memories hinting at his dark past, at the Kell nobody remembers or everyone chooses to forget...<br /><br />Remic certainly managed a tour de force with Kell's Legend. I've never read anything quite so unapologetic about its violence, but also brilliant in its brute force. Kell's Legend is rough, for sure; at the same time, however, it's entertaining and powerful, taking all that is wonderful about truly epic, adventurous fantasy and twisting it like Quentin Tarantino twists the movies. Remic is the Tarantino of fantasy (and science fiction, I presume), and if that isn't a compliment, then I don't know what is.<br /><br />Kell's Legend isn't just about action and brilliantly detailed fights. It's packed full of amazing dialogue (and some clever witty banter to boot), and the characters are three-dimensional, something I think many fantasy writers of the more action-packed vein (including myself) have issue with. Remic has managed to put together a tale that pushes the boundaries while maintaining the necessary elements of a good fantasy novel (interesting characters, gripping conflicts, etc.).<br /><br />There were only two problems I had with Kell's Legend:<br />1) Sometimes the action can be a bit much. For the most part it's entertaining and propels the plot, but sometimes it feels overbearing; there aren't a lot of breaks.<br />2) The language is outside of my comfort zone in one scene (and only one, as far as I can recall). If his language had kept in that vein for more than one chapter, then I would have tossed the book at the wall, but, thankfully, that is not what happened. However, if you cannot stand foul language in any form, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />Both of these problems are personal preferences and not indicative of any significant fault of the novel or Remic. If you aren't bothered by these things, then this is definitely a book for you. If you're already a Remic fan, then you'll love Kell's Legend.<br /><br />I look forward to the second book in the series. I'd love to know what happens with the Clockwork Vampires, Kell, his granddaughter, and some of the other characters.", "images": [], "asin": "0007324154", "parent_asin": "0007324154", "user_id": "AE7GYCYSPV76DQZL3HB4SOQVRZRQ", "timestamp": 1254331984000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Entertaining", "text": "The Book of TOAD is an entertaining story that opens the door to a backstage view to the world of psychiatry as an  industry and career choice. In a clever and original premise, the narrator, a psyciatric resident at UCLA Medical Center, inadvertently inspires a patient to invent a web application that turns out to be a popular, wiki-like source of religious wisdom, called TOAD.<br /><br />The book is populated with a dozen or so interesting characters, and kept my interest all the way through. The main thrust of the story, however, is not TOAD. The first half of the book reads like an autobiography, focusing mainly on the narrator's ambivalence about his own career. Only in the second half of the book does an actual plot develop, involving chicanery within the political and professional world of psychiatry. Structured more like a mystery yarn, the intrigue of the second half succeeded at drawing me in to the conclusion.<br /><br />Unfortunately the book missed some interesting possibilities in exploring the \"wisdom\" of TOAD and the narrator's relation to it. Despite being seen as the project's inspiration, the narrator remains aloof from it, surprised that anyone is taking it seriously. We're told that TOAD enjoys legions of users who genuinely benefit from the program.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "So cute!", "text": "Did you know that the author of this book, Alecia Whitaker, is from Cynthiana, Kentucky? Did you also know that I live about an hour away from there? Crazy! I could just relate to this book so much. What Alecia Whitaker wrote was so relatable and so true for this area of the country.<br /><br />The story is about an all country farm girl Ricki Jo, but please call her Ericka if she is at school. She is fourteen years old, lives on her father's farm, and her best friend Luke Foster lives just right down the street. This coming of age novel talks about all the things a girl wants to happen once she enters High School. Ricki Jo wants to be popular and fit in with the cool crowd, but can she still be herself and not change to fit in with the popular crowd?<br /><br />I just loved this book so much! I could relate so much to Ricki Jo at parts in the book. My dad was also a Tabaco farmer, but quite once there was a big buy out which is just what Ricki Jo's dad did also. I live on a farm with cattle, crops, and barns. So I just got really into the story. Ricki Jo lived in a town that isn't too different from mine. The author uses a lot of references that I could understand.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the characters. Ricki Jo is friends with a bunch of mean girls, but at the end you really see redeeming qualities in them all. My favorite character was Luke and he really held the book together at times. While there relationship was perdictable, I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen with them in the end. I am glad that Ricki Jo's friend Mackenzie turned out to be a true friend. I really liked her at the beginning and thought that she was nice to Ricki Jo when the other girls weren't.<br /><br />Ricki Jo is relatable to me because there have been a lot of times that I have been in the same position as her. I never really fit in at my high school and I remember putting up with mean comments, just to say that I have friends. But I never had as good as friend as Luke. Ricki Jo is lucky! I also loved all her funny commentary; there were parts when I was laughing out loud.<br /><br />I also just got to say I love Kentucky! It is so beautiful and I love how the author you a lot of descriptive language to describe their farm and how farm life was.<br /><br />Overall, The Queen of Kentucky has a very good message that I think everybody should take the time to read. I would recommend this to any girl that is in middle school. I really enjoyed it and glad that I had it down in my 2012 Debut Author Challenge. I really wish that the author would write another one. There is so much that could go on with these characters! I also just want to read more about Ricki Jo and Luke!

And on top of that-- he validates her existence so much that she magically becomes happy/content in herself and her life and she loses weight?

Whitlow actually makes law sound interesting without using a lot of lawyer jargon. With numerous roadblocks and several critical junctions, I liked the winding route he took getting to the conclusion of the story. The characters are so real and cover such a broad spectrum of personalities. For me, the best scene in the story took place on the evening when Buddy and Gracie joined Beatrice and the judge for dinner. I would have loved to have heard Gracie as she prayed before their dinner. Some books have a faint spiritual undercurrent with an over-abundance of romance, action, and suspense. I appreciated the manner in which Gracie was able to just be herself and let her inner beauty shine out to light up the world around her. Unlike many who try to force their beliefs on others, she had a way of living her beliefs in such a way that people gravitated to her and trusted her with their deepest concerns. In so doing, they often opened themselves to receive a special touch from above in such a natural and unrehearsed manner. The world could use a lot more people like her.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A painful portrait of the poor in Colombia", "text": "This book is a chilling collection of voices first published in the UK.  The accounts come from the very poor in Colombia.  To that end, most of the voices are female.  Journalist Constanza Ardila Galvis does an outstanding job of capturing the views of the poor in the Colombian countryside.  However, she is guilty on two counts.  One...the views are overwhelmingly pro-guerrilla and secondly her prose is too melodramatic.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "\"Lion Man\" \"Green Eyes\" loved it", "text": "The Secret Enemy Saga \u201cFracture\u201d Book #1 by Virginia McKevitt<br /><br />Where do I start??? I just recently had the pleasure of meeting Virginia McKevitt at a book signing function in New Orleans.  I hadn\u2019t heard of her as an Author and was not familiar with her work.  I read all types but heavy into the paranormal, erotic, sci fi and contemporary romance.  None of which really are YA or NA.  I picked up both the books at the signing and promised Virginia I would read them.  Well since I hadn\u2019t brought my kindle with me I decided to start the first book.  I was a little tired and didn\u2019t get far along.  I didn\u2019t have the chance to pick it back up until I got back from New Orleans.<br /><br />When I started reading I\u2019ll be honest I wasn\u2019t sure if this was something for me, I realize the first few chapters most authors set up the characters so it might be a tad slow, once we got past the formalities of the characters (BTW the set up was actually very interesting.  Good back ground info for later in the read), the read took off.  OMG I so wasn\u2019t expecting that.<br /><br />Kristina based on all accounts is one feisty, strong willed, strong headed no nonsense young lady.  When her parents were murdered she didn\u2019t crumble and fall apart, now don\u2019t get me wrong, yes she was devastated, but she was out to seek revenge.  She wanted to see whoever did this dead. Kristina was what we might call a half breed. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying on this subject. In comes Tegrin Guardian/Assassin and the King\u2019s right hand man. Tegrin was sent on a mission by his King to dispose of the Couton (A clan of Women who feed off others emotions) who had found the opening between the two worlds.  They wanted out from under the King to do as they pleased.  On top of the pleasure they experienced from feeding on the memories of the humans they were experiencing other emotions and it became an addiction.  In the small town of Blessings the bodies were piling up and Tegrin was sent to stop them. It\u2019s in Kristina\u2019s home Tegrin meets his destiny \u201cKristina\u201d (grant it he doesn\u2019t know that yet).  Tegrin was to get in and out and not let any humans see him.  That didn\u2019t work out so well. He ends up allying with Kristina\u2019s two friends Sissy and Jimmy and of course Sissy\u2019s dog Bo a retired CIA operative in order to stop the Couton.  So much for humans not finding out.<br /><br />There was a lot unknown about Kristina and we do find out what she is.  The story played out perfectly.  From the tattoo appearing after her first kill, to her warrior like instincts. What happens when she finds her real Dad\u2019s military foot locker left to her when he died, to her going to Potwain with Tegrin to meet her Grandfather and be trained as a guardian and taught how to use her powers.  She\u2019s the best of both worlds.<br /><br />There is a little touch of humor, for example when Tegrin brings Ahmor (a Guardian) to train and fight with Kristina (because he can\u2019t be around her) and she breaks his nose. My favorite was when Kristina smacked Maketi\u2019s nose (Tegrins Stallion).  Now you have to understand everyone feared Tegrin but they feared his horse also.  She had those two spinning.  She showed absolutely no fear.  As in all good reads there is a sad part but you\u2019ll need to read for yourself I don\u2019t want to give too many spoilers.  Hmmmm but I\u2019m going to give one now Tegrin and Kristina do the deed. YES.  The stone cold hearted Assassin who has no emotions fell for our girl.  Everyone saw it.  The King, her grandfather everyone.  I loved it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A captivating memoir", "text": "I started this book this afternoon, intending to read one chapter. And hour later, I was so caught up in the story that I read the whole thing. Dinner was late. It was worth it.<br /><br />Girl at the End of the World is a memoir by Elizabeth Esther,  a woman who grew up in a fundamentalist branch of Christianity founded by her grandfather.  It\u2019s essentially the story of what happens when enthusiastic followers of Jesus (her grandparents were influenced by the Jesus Movement) slowly shift from the faith that drew them in and get wrapped up in rules and behavioral codes and the strict dictates of one charismatic, unaccountable leader.<br /><br />The storytelling here is so good. The author masterfully shares the scenes of her childhood without bitterness \u2013 towards God, faith, or her family. It\u2019s impressive, and the book is one of the best I\u2019ve read in this genre.  I was surprised by how relatable this story is. I grew up as far away from a faith based cult as one can imagine, and yet I feel like I want to sit down with the author, pour a glass of wine, and talk about the amazing ways God works in our lives. She really succeeds in making readers feel like friends.<br /><br />The story is divided into three sections: her childhood, her experience breaking out and trying to navigate mainstream culture, and then her process of figuring out a new way to engage with God outside of her strict, abusive upbringing. I loved it all. Her descriptions of her childhood are so vivid, I felt like I was right there (which was difficult at times \u2013 there are some tough moments).  Her take on first encountering Oprah Winfrey\u2019s show and how quickly television commercials stirred up a dissatisfaction with her life she\u2019d never felt before is a great reminder of how much we\u2019re being manipulated by what we watch.  And there\u2019s a real sweetness to how God pursues her as she and her husband seek a new way to raise their own family.<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this manuscript from the publisher in exchange for a review.", "images": [], "asin": "0307731871", "parent_asin": "0307731871", "user_id": "AFG3AKZLOUOGEPVO35TBMVFM74ZQ", "timestamp": 1395448695000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
