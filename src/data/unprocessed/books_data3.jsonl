{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "The  Last Days of the Tavern", "text": "_Callahan's Secret_ (1986) is the third collection of stories about Callahan's crosstime saloon. In an introduction, Robinson stated that this would probably be the last of the Callahan books. It wasn't. But I think that it is fair to say that the later stories were \\\"second cycle Callahan tales.\\\" A number of things come to and end in this collection.<br /><br /> There are four stories in the collection, all novelettes from _Analog_: \\\"The Blacksmith's Tale,\\\" \\\"Pyotyr's Story,\\\" \\\"Involuntary Man's Laughter,\\\" and \\\"The Mick of Time.\\\" A comparison between these tales and the stories in the first collection, _Callahan's Crosstime Salooon_ (1977), shows a marked difference. The later stories are more skillfully plotted, more smoothly written, and a bit more bawdy. Also, the jokes, tall tales, and puns are-- if you can believe it-- more clever and outrageous.<br /><br /> We sometimes have a tendency to underrate humorous fiction. Great fiction must be serious and solemn. Humerous fiction can be _good_, you understand. But not great. We forget that doing humor really well can be deucedly hard. In any event, I am giving top rating for these stories. They are some of the best of the Callahan's Place stories. They are great fun and great writing.\", \"images\": [], \"asin\": \"0812572297\", \"parent_asin\": \"0812572297\", \"user_id\": \"AFKQOH5UOFIZUE4R5ITELBUZ6HJA\", \"timestamp\": 1197534903000, \"helpful_vote\": 8, \"verified_purchase\": false}\n{\"label\": 1, \"rating\": 4.0, \"title\": \"Very nice\", \"text\": \"Was exaclty what i was wanting, just wished it wasnt so big, but really good.<br />Really good for couples to do together, just remember all of your \\\"firsts.\\\"\", \"images\": [], \"asin\": \"1579771041\", \"parent_asin\": \"1579771041\", \"user_id\": \"AHJUUHQ6GHYG4SAASV3MQCAX6QDQ\", \"timestamp\": 1324401349000, \"helpful_vote\": 0, \"verified_purchase\": true}\n{\"label\": 1, \"rating\": 5.0, \"title\": \"Easy and Tasty Plant Based Recipes\", \"text\": \"There are plenty of recipes in every category from soups to desserts; main dishes to smoothies.

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "An utterly delectable and totally addictive New Adult romance", "text": "BOOMERANG is an utterly delectable, incredibly exciting and totally addictive story that is the perfect blend of sexy and sweet. Told from both Mia and Ethan\u2019s perspectives, this story will keep those pages turning as things between them go from awkward to competitive with an undercurrent of tension that sizzles.<br /><br />Waking from what should have been an unforgettable night that neither can quite remember, Mia and Ethan soon learn that their one-night hookup was not the last they would see of one another. When it turns out that they\u2019re both vying for the same job, they\u2019ll have to decide what\u2019s more important \u2013 the chance at an amazing opportunity with Boomerang or the possibility of seeing whether the connection they have could lead to something more.<br /><br />The authors crafted a novel with two very likable characters whose chemistry is electric, whose predicament makes for a story that is at times angst-filled, at others swoonworthy, and whose happily ever after readers will very much hope for. They don\u2019t skimp on character development - readers will get to know and adore both Mia and Ethan, with all their flaws, insecurities and hang-ups, and they\u2019ll get a peek at one of the central characters in the next book in the series.<br /><br />As things heat up both on the job and off, more will be revealed about past relationships, current desires, how they met, and what landing the job at Boomerang really means to each of them. Their story is captivating and romantic, a touch suspenseful and a little bit heartbreaking. It\u2019s a story that will be unputdownable.<br /><br />From the competition, to Mia and Ethan\u2019s undeniable attraction, to the head-meets-desk decisions, to the questions about what exactly happened that first night, BOOMERANG is a quick, nail-biting and wildly entertaining read. It\u2019s a fantastic start to this series that is not to be missed by fans of this genre or readers who like clever and engaging stories with just the right amount of heat, sexual tension and romance.", "images": [], "asin": "006233106X", "parent_asin": "006233106X", "user_id": "AE7G7Z35FDEKPIZO636ZRNFL3O6A", "timestamp": 1406750099000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

It gets pretty established though that the work environment is hostile in a lot of ways, since it was a merger of two very different companies with opposing views on the world of publishing. The co-CEO is a blatant sexist. The main character Lucy acknowledges that she's not proud of her behavior, and you get the sense her nemesis Josh never has been proud of it either. He says as much actually. People aren't perfect. We find out that Lucy's childishness is due to just being plain lonely and homesick and wanting attention from the only person she interacts with day in and day out. She's smart and quirky and witty, with lots of attitude. I loved seeing the layers of Josh peeling away as well throughout the book, and learning why he acts the way he does. The way they banter and flirt is amazing, and seeing their relationship develop was so rewarding, paying off with one of the sweetest and hottest love scenes I've read since Chapter 55 of ACOMAF.

{"label": 1, "rating": 4.0, "title": "CHILLING SUSPENSE, FINE AS A STAND ALONE TOO", "text": "VANISH is part 5 in the Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles series. However I read it as a stand alone and did just fine, so I can recommend it that way too. I'd also never heard of author Tess Gerritsen before this but will definitely be searching out more from her and this series. I loved her style of writing, the realistic characters, the suspenseful medical based plot and the fast moving thrill of this story as a whole. There were elements that you could tell if you were invested in the series (and reading it in order) would have been even better or funnier or sadder however I never felt lost or left out of some big plot due to the excellent story telling. This is crime writing suspense at its very best.<br /><br />Vanish pulls you in from the very first page starting with Mila's heartbreaking story of human trafficking. She and a group of Russian girls are crossing into America from Mexico having been lured there by the promise of a better life however by the end of the chapter one of the girls is dead and Mila has been sold into a prostitution ring. Mila's story (which we keep flashing back to) is gritty and often hard to read probably because it is very real.<br /><br />We then switch to coroner Maura Isles who is going about her daily routine (in vivid medical detail) when she discovers that one of the bodies in the morgue is still alive. \"Jane Doe\" is rushed to the emergency room where we meet up with our other protagonist Detective Jane Rizzoli who has just gone into labour following a take down at the courthouse (she rocks)<br /><br />Through a fantastic series of events that kept me on the edge of my seat and never able to guess what was coming next, the formerly \"dead\" woman grabs a security guards gun and takes 6 people hostage in the hospital, one of which is Detective Rizzoli. \"Jane Doe\" won't talk to the police negotiator and we only learn her motives after a man disguised as member of the SWAT team joins her. His story is equally enthralling.<br /><br />This tense drama plays out for a large part of the book bringing in a host of other characters (and their POV'S) along with clever plot twists and exciting action. All of which Gerritsen manages to tie together. We meet Jane's husband FBI agent Gabriel Dean (I'm assuming we met him in earlier books) we also have Jane's partner (hints of a love triangle), reporters, spies and bad guys in Washington. We get crime scene investigations and the makings of a political thriller which thankfully doesn't take over and a very realistic story involving a new mother trying to get to know her baby while maintaining her identity.

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "Glad I finally read it - Should have read it sooner!", "text": "I finally read this book right before the movie came out. I admit that this book had been sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust. I also admit to enjoying the Twilight books, so I was not opposed to Ms. Meyer's writing or style. But I'm not a huge Sci-Fi person, and the premise of this book just did not appeal to me, despite having friends tell me how much they liked it. So I procrastinated...and procrastinated...and procrastinated. It took the movie and a Stephenie Meyer event I attended to kick me in the butt and move it up my reading pile. And once I read it, what do I have to say now?<br /><br />I LOVED IT! This was one of those books where I just shook my heads and thought to myself, \"What took me so long?\" This was a beautifully written book, exposing the many layers of love and humanity. The size of the book is intimidating, and it starts a bit slowly. But I found reading it worth the time and for me the reading process quickly sped up as I became more and more engaged and invested with the characters and plot. I found the plot unique and engaging, the character development well fleshed-out, the multi-layers of love development thoughtful, and the analysis of real humanity beautifully examined.<br /><br />I also admit to not being a fan of love triangles. They tend to be exhausting, unrealistic, selfish, and overly dramatic. But what I loved about this story is that it really wasn't a love triangle, not in the simplistic sense of the term. I don't want to spoil the plot, but I found the whole thought process and relationship between Melanie and Wanderer fascinating. I really found their relationship the most engaging. Then with a love interest or two thrown in there, and the confusion over two minds sharing one body, the plot really thickened, but again, with an imaginative process. And the love discussed wasn't limited to just romantic love - there's also friendship, family, forgiveness, camaraderie, community, sacrifice, and many levels of love in between these. This is one of the things and subjects I was most impressed with in this novel.<br /><br />Bottomline: I loved this book and added it as one of my favorites. I have also listened to the audiobook (because I needed to read/hear the book twice in a row, it was so good), and found the narrator quite engaging, so if you'd prefer the audio-version over text, I highly recommend it. This is one of those books you don't want to pre-judge. Perhaps you disliked Twilight, perhaps you hate love triangles, or perhaps you have an aversion to Sci-Fi.

Spithill shares the stories of these three America\u2019s Cup campaigns, offering fascinating behind-the-scenes insight during the most disruptive period in the event\u2019s modern history.<br /><br />Spithill also uses the book to even the score with critics, question authority, opine on parenthood, and teach the tenets of team. While the reporting on his Team Oracle era came with some bias, I believe he fulfilled his mission with the book to show how honest effort can be rewarded.<br /><br />I appreciated Spithill for taking on the challenge of sharing his story and recommend this easy read, especially to anyone who seeks to inspire youth sailors to reach farther.", "images": [], "asin": "1472948076", "parent_asin": "1472948076", "user_id": "AEOD6MXTSTMUWXZUAKFJHZW2CSMQ", "timestamp": 1504013184907, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

Maisie is a woman ahead of her time, she's gutsy, ambitious and smart as a whip.<br /><br />Maisie Dobbs began her first job at age thirteen. Her parents wanted to send her to college but the unexpected death of her Mum changed that and her father found a job for her in a suitable position.<br /><br />Maisie became a maid in an home of Lord and Lady Rowan Compton. Lady Compton was a suffragette and was for the advancement of woman in general. In Maisie, she noticed her in her library and Maisie told her she wanted to read books and learn. Lady Compton was impressed and kept her eye on Maisie. Later, when Maisie became an investigator she sent Maisie customers.<br /><br />Later, as WWI began, Maisie took nursing training and went to France to help care for the soldiers who were being injured in many ways with gas, shrapnel, bullet wounds and psychological injuries. While overseas, working with the soldiers she was drawn to one.<br /><br />After the war, Maisie uses some skills learned from one of Lady Compton's connections. Dr. Blanche was a trained psychologist and detective. He taught Maisie deductive thinking and since she had good common sense, he told her to trust her instincts and to beware of coincidences.<br /><br />Her first case leads her to a woman who would travel to a cemetery twice a week to mourn a young soldier. Maisie travels to a convalescent home being used for wounded and maimed soldiers.<br /><br />What I liked about the book was Maisie's compassion, her desire to raise above the situation to which she was born, and her manner in working with patients and the people around her.<br /><br />The scenes in France are well described and we get a look at the difficulties the young nurses faced during the Great War. They not only had to deal with soldiers wounded grievously but they had strict rules of behavior and little understanding for their plight.", "images": [], "asin": "1616954078", "parent_asin": "1616954078", "user_id": "AHV25QXIC4BZ5MNJXPTPGVQR73VA", "timestamp": 1440023791000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

The previous Christmas titles are as follows:  A Lone Star Christmas, A Rocky Mountain Christmas, A Big Sky Christmas, A Frontier Christmas, A Texas Hill Christmas, A Colorado Christmas, An Arizona Christmas, A High Sierra Christmas, A Jensen Family Christmas and A MacCallister Christmas.  Each book can be read alone and in any order a reader chooses.  The novels include some of the favorite characters from Johnstone country such as Smoke and Sally Jensen, Preacher, etc.<br />In A Death Valley Christmas, it was enjoyable to meet up again with Ace and Chance Jensen.  The story starts out with a descendant of theirs telling of one of the twin\u2019s adventures from the past.  As I turned pages, it was not only the plot that held my attention but the geographic location of the tale.<br />While these rugged men go wherever they choose, they have no problem stepping in to help those in need.  When Chance wins a silver mine in a poker game, what sounds promising may hold more trouble than it is worth.  Ace and Chance are each other\u2019s best friend, and they rely on each other to come to the other\u2019s aid if the need ever arises, which it does often!<br />As I neared the end of the tale, the authors introduced a familiar character which brings even more excitement to the conclusion of the book.

The first part, chronicling Sidonie's pre-Morocco experiences of disease and loss, was difficult reading, because it was hard to watch someone having such a miserable life (although the author made it completely believable). But, once she got to Morocco, the story really turned around for me. The author did a great job of depicting the country, and I felt that I was there with Sidonie. The characters were interesting and well developed. From a travel standpoint, it was great: the very atmospheric back alleys of Marrakesh in 1930 and the landscape beyond the cities, with the nomadic Tuaregs. But it was also fascinating to watch Sidonie's development from a sheltered, repressed individual to one with growing confidence and a real sense of being where she was meant to be. This was almost as much of a story as the more obvious plot line.

After reading his latest effort, I must say that I likely won't waste my time reading another of his books. I applaud him for writing a book about this campaign, but it is again painfully obvious that he has limited writing skills, a poor grasp of character development, a lack of technical knowledge regarding weapons, army organization, etc., and a real ignorance of militaries other than the United States. As other reviewers have stated, the few battle scenes are poorly drawn, and unexciting, he makes numerous technical errors, and the fictional protangists in particular are unconvincing. Another reviewer mentioned the removal of Jewish American POWS, by black trench-coated Gestapo agents, in Tunisia, in May. Never happened, and this was the final straw for me. I will admit that I expect an author to know his subject, especially when it comes to historical topics. If Bernard Cornwall, Patrick O'Brien, W.E.B. Griffith,C.S. Forrester, etc., etc. can do it, why not Shaara? It amazes me that so many people rave about this book, and his earlier efforts.

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "Great comprehensive history", "text": "In terms of format, this book is almost like a textbook of Byzantine history. Each chapter has a clear purpose and a mini-timeline, differences in text size and shape mark off the sections and subsections, and there are even inserts every few pages with primary sources. This actually helped me mentally organize the details of what was happening - there's a lot to keep track of in 12 centuries!<br /><br />A few elements that I really liked:<br />1) Graphic Organizers and Visuals. The author occasionally made use of graphic organizers - for example, representing the hierarchy of Byzantine governments with a table, or showing the decline in value of the nomismata in the 11th century. In addition, rather than banishing the images to an appendix, the author actually integrates them into the relevant sections of the text. It's a pleasant surprise to find a historian who actually appreciates the value of a good illustration to, you know, illustrate history.<br /><br />2) Breadth. This is a broad history - the focus is not just on the emperors or on Constantinople, but on the Empire as a whole. I appreciate that the author takes the time to explore social and economic trends, art, literature, and ordinary life.<br /><br />3) Historiography. The author cites other scholars, and also talks about both debates and shifts in understanding. The best example was his take on the Blues vs. Greens fights of the 5th-6th centuries. According to the author, while older scholars often tried to impose a religious, class, or political ideology on these fights, it's better to view the Blues and Greens as the Late Antiquity version of football hooligans who liked to riot. As a non-expert, it's actually helpful for me to understand how scholarship has changed.<br /><br />4) The last chapter is about post-Byzantine Byzantine culture. Most Byzantine histories that I read use the last chapter to eulogize the fallen empire. In contrast, this author actually explores what happened to Byzantine culture after the Ottoman conquest. I appreciate that the author acknowledges that the Greeks, Armenians, and Slavs didn't just magically stop practicing their culture after 1453.<br /><br />Great general history, would recommend it to anyone new to the Byzantine fandom.", "images": [], "asin": "0631235132", "parent_asin": "0631235132", "user_id": "AHTBPY6EI6JIOCLQZFQNQKWTX2FA", "timestamp": 1558924827500, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

They both grew so much over the course of this story, which I lived for. Not only them, there were also side characters showing obvious signs of growth. Any author capable of doing that deserves an extra star in my book!<br />When it comes to Georgie, I specifically loved seeing her go from being and feeling the \u201clittle sister\u201d towards being her own woman, standing up for herself and fighting for what she wants. Seeing that evolution was wonderful.<br /><br />As mentioned in the triggers, there are quite a few explicit sex scenes in this book. I didn\u2019t mind them at all \u2013 but I know some people don\u2019t care for that type of thing. All in all, I found them well written \u2013 apart from all the dirty talk. I\u2019m simply.. not that kind of person so I wouldn\u2019t have mind had that aspect not been present, haha.<br /><br />In my intro, I mentioned the renovating company being one of the things that piqued my interest. It wasn\u2019t that present, but it was there enough for me to be satisfied. As for the fake relationship-trope? I loved how it was done! Not every author is able to pull it off, but I enjoyed seeing Georgie and Travis struggle with their feelings, doubting the realness of their fake relationship and eventually having to admit to themselves what was going on. Yup, definitely my cup of tea!<br /><br />I only have ONE but:<br /><br />Travis, our other main character, definitely had his own demons to fight. Unfortunately, the story focused way more on Georgie\u2019s growth, struggle and evolution than it did on his. I would\u2019ve loved to have more insight in his past, his brain and his feelings.

{"label": 1 , "rating": 4.0, "title": "I think the most enjoyable thing of this novel was the ending", "text": "This review has been crossposted from my blog at The Cosy Dragon.com. Please head there for more in-depth reviews by me, which appear on a timely schedule.<br /><br />'Skeleton Key' is the third book in this series about Alex Rider, a teenage spy. Alex is sent on an expensive holiday to Skeleton Key in Cuba. Well, it's supposed to be a holiday, but really he's there to do his job - nuclear war is coming. Hit the jump for more...<br /><br />Alex is given the opportunity to see tennis live at Wimbledon. However, instead of the interesting time he expected to have, he uncovers a sinister plot by the Triad. He heads off on a surfing holiday with his budding girlfriend Serena, but is followed there by the Triad. MI6 says that they will put him out of harm's way by sending him on a tropical vacation. What could go wrong? Everything in fact.<br /><br />I think the most enjoyable thing of this novel was the ending, seeing Alex push through the terrors he had been through to become a better person on the other side. In this novel you can really see him grow up, and start taking an interest in girls. Horowitz has managed to take a series that could become quite stale with the same character and same spy elements and make it continue to develop.<br /><br />This novel is more bloody than the first two novels (in the same way that the Harry Potter series became more adult as it progressed). I'd still say that children could read it, but not those with impressionable minds or those who were likely to be scared. If they enjoyed the first two novels, this is certainly not too much of a step forward.", "images": [], "asin": "0142406147", "parent_asin": "0142406147", "user_id": "AEQMNJF7DPAPKF43TPUAKQ367G7Q", "timestamp": 1425612911000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 1, "rating": 4.0, "title": "Interesting Follow-Up", "text": "Well, this sure did start one place and go somewhere no one could have ever seen coming.<br />In this follow-up to the Cinderella story, the stepsisters are followed in the aftermath of what happened after the night they tried to hack their feet up to fit in the slipper that Cinderella rightfully owned. It starts with them having to deal with an entire town of people snickering and mocking them for being \"ugly\" and terrible people for what they did to poor Ella. They locked her up and made her a servant to them,etc (you know the story). So, people charge them more for less and they run low on money so bad things happen.<br />The story really focuses on one stepsister though both are part of the whole story. Isabelle is the main character and the one that longs the most to be beautiful because she feels that to be beautiful is all it takes to get what you want in the world. Like Ella. So when she meets a \"fairy god mother\" of sorts that's what she says she wants the most so when she is told she needs to do somethings before her wish can be granted, she sets out to do them.On the other side she has \"fate\" and \"chance\" betting on her. Each comes into play as a person in her life. How they play their part is for you to find out.<br />So much is going on and happening in this book, I'm not even touching the surface. This book is packed full of story. It has some 'girl power' themes running through it that are really good with some strong messages for young and old alike. It has so many good things going for it!

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "Superb guide for becoming emotionally intelligent", "text": "Charles Stanley has put together a superb guide to unraveling the truth about our emotions and lies about the same. In a day and age when emotions seem to be out of control frequently for so many people, this book is a necessity. If only someone taught young people how to handle their emotions and deal with them successfully, we would not hear about the violent tragedies which have come to be part of our daily lives. This book helps do just that. It has helped me tremendously. I also found great help in a book by Lin Tomasso which I recently downloaded to my laptop. It's called Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered. I paid $2.99 for it at smashwords.com. You can download it to your computer or any device, nothing special needed. The author is straight forward and funny, and will have you laughing at her real life experiences-she puts on no airs. Thanks to her book, I learned how to pray correctly. There's a formula for prayer which actually produces results, so if you're going to pray, you'd might as well do it right. I'm seeing positive results now since I corrected my former errors. I highly recommend both books, and I want to say again that Lin Tomasso's Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered at smashwords.com will truly help you get your prayers answered so I\u2019m spreading the word so that others can receive the benefits I have. I believe both these books will help every reader.", "images": [], "asin": "1476752060", "parent_asin": "1476752060", "user_id": "AH2SFW532VBHSUWVP5BJF2QVBSCA", "timestamp": 1382489608000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"label": -1, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Mirrors are one of the few things that easily freak me out..", "text": "I received a free copy of Mirror Image from the publisher in return for an honest review.<br /><br />I was excited to make a start on Mirror Image because mirrors are one of the few things that easily freak me out. I was looking forwards to immersing myself in a story that had the potential to put me on edge, unfortunately, that didn't happen. It took me 4 days to read 325 pages, kinda says it all really.<br /><br />The book started off well but I soon found my attention wandering. I couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters, they were flat and unappealing. The reasonings behind the characters actions were insubstantial, I felt like they were just going through the motions for the sake of the story. Where was the fear? The inner conflict? The panic? There was nothing of substance driving them, they came across as puppets playing out a story rather than real people living through the story.<br /><br />Throughout the book the reader is taken back and forth between several different timelines. The timelines reveal the history of the mirror, how it came to be, and the characters that have been a part of its story before the present timeline. For this format to work the different timelines need to come together, to flow into each other and build a bigger picture, a more in-depth understanding, but in this case they felt disjointed and too separate from one another. The ending felt rushed and thrown together. I think I was holding out hope that things would come together in the end and that it would at least be worth the reading time invested. It wasn't, it lead to even more disappointment<br /><br />There was also quite a few inconsistencies and plot holes, as well as many spelling mistakes, typos, wrong words etc, which really didn't help improve the reading experience.<br /><br />Not one I would recommend.", "images": [], "asin": "0765385228", "parent_asin": "0765385228", "user_id": "AHX7JX33DX2N2OZIHZ4TTDAXT3QA", "timestamp": 1472006075000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "When you run out of Narnia books, give this a shot", "text": "This is book five in a series of eight.  Imagine a Christian version of Indiana  Jones who travels the word with his two teenage kids having archeological adventures in the 1990's.<br /><br />This book is not the best in the series, and the series is not the best writing Peretti has ever done.  The plots, dialog, character development, and style in the five books I've read so far just aren't on par with some of the other books he has written.  That said, my 9 and 12 year old children love the series and I can be confident that each page is kid safe.  The stories may not have allegories and apologetical theory wrapped in every other sentence, but they have a sprinkle of scripture in good measure along with practical application of faith by each and every character that is believable.<br /><br />This particular book has an unexplained premise that really doesn't make a lot of sense even when you are open to a supernatural explanation.  The resolution also leaves a lot to be desired as it doesn't fit either into a good theologian's prayer book or a Scooby-Do scientific \"Man behind the curtain\" kind of explanation.  But like most of the books in this series, the plot allows for tension to build through the story that gives the author time to plant seeds of wisdom and faith.  And more importantly as I said before, my kids are no where near as critical as I am and truly loved it.  If you're looking for a series of Christian themed books for young adults, this series is pretty good.", "images": [], "asin": "B007FZOXXI", "parent_asin": "B007FZOXXI", "user_id": "AGM2PXNSFVORRU2ZBOR43FGTFBHQ", "timestamp": 1608580199276, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I wish the authors would compile more major mishap (non-loss) data for a second edition; I personally know of some major incidents (in-air collisions, speed-inflicted damage, etc.) that aren't reflected in the book's section on mishaps, and I'm just one former knuckle dragger -- I bet interviewing former aircrews and crew chiefs would reveal a ton of additional incidents.", "images": [], "asin": "0764342789", "parent_asin": "0764342789", "user_id": "AGEYOONM2KVZX3SBTULWHCT7C54A", "timestamp": 1390747988000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}
