{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "In the Mindset of a Ballerina", "text": "Meg Howrey's \"the Crane's Dance\" allows the reader passage to the labyrinthine mind tunnel of a principal dancer in a prestigious New York City dance company.  Main character Kate's first person narrative twists and turns acting as a 24/7 commentary on \"a day in the life\" of a ballerina.  While this would certainly appeal to anyone who has secretly or outwardly coveted tutus, point shoes or just has a gold ballet slipper charm on a nostalgic bracelet, Howrey adds mental stress to Kate's already precariously balanced sense of physical and psychological well-being by injecting a more-talented yet less stable sister for whom Kate feels a mixture of envy, compassion and guilt.<br /><br />All of the siblings of the Crane family have risen to be some sort of performance stars.  Brother Keith, a professional tennis player, calls his family from tennis circuit destinations from around the world.  Gwen, the other ballerina, dances with such ease, she immediately is placed in a starring role.  In fact, she seems to do everything with her own particular effortless grace, including moving in on Kate's boyfriends, sleeping with them, and calling them her own.  Is there any wonder that Kate would feel some impetus to not only be successful but to excel beyond normal expectations?  Kate's opportunity to become a principal comes only when Gwen's instability challenges her very sanity; Gwen is hospitalized and Kate takes her place on the stage.  Her success is tinged with feelings of regret, guilt and the sense of being second best.<br /><br />As Kate goes about her daily routine of classes and performances, her mind floods with thoughts of her sister.  She knows she should view her with compassion yet her need to be a star in her own right revels in her sister's absence.  When Kate hurts her neck while performing in Swan Lake (which will call to mind [[ASIN:B0041KKYEM Black Swan]]), her subsequent dependence on drugs along with the normal stresses of sustaining the athleticism of her ballet, the knowledge that a career of dance is ephemeral and her insecurity with herself reign supreme in her mind and she begins to spiral down the same black hole as her sister.<br /><br />Howrey, once a member of a ballet company herself, presents the disjointed world of ballet and performance art in general, for the competitive microcosm that it is.  However difficult it may be to follow Kate's narrative at times as it wanders with her mind in a circuitous Crane's Dance (Howrey's allusion to Theseus's movements in and out of the Minotaur's Labyrinth), her voice rings true and a view of this world from the inside is revealed warts and all.  In terms of a compelling story, however, the disjointedness of Kate's emotional unravelling as detailed by her mind calling up past and present moments can be confusing and does stop the flow of the actual plot.<br /><br />Kate's relationship with a young ballerina wannabe is especially poignant; she is flattered by Bryce's fascination with her, but is reluctant to push her into a life of grueling routine, insecurity and ephemeral success.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \"The Crane's Dance\" by Meg Howrey gives an insider's perspective of ballet.  Impeded by her sister's emotional collapse, main character Kate finds the strenuous world of dance overwhelming.  At times, Howrey's narration seems disjointed even when it follows the track of the main character's mind.

It drew me in, sparked a question in my mind so that I tracked this book down and read it.<br /><br />WRITING STYLE:<br />Simplistic.  Too detailed in some places, not detailed enough in others.  There were parts that seemed superfluous, and sections where the drama was HIGH but the writing wasn't good enough to capture the moment, which is a darn shame because Ms. DiDonato has accomplished some simply amazing things.<br /><br />As for the book in it's entirety:<br />For me this book seemed to fall into 3 parts.  The first part was interesting, but not riveting stuff.  It served it's purpose though as it formed the background for the second part which had me on the edge of my seat.  This section dealt with the most difficult parts of Tiffanie's surgeries and I found it an inspiring example of human courage and strength.<br /><br />This was followed, unfortunately, by a poorly crafted description of her life after The Big surgery.  I found part of this so vaguely described that it wasn't 'satisfying'.  While another part was so oddly personal that it bordered on creepy --to me, at least: others might find it >>><br /><br />>>>SPOILER ALERT  SPOILER ALERT>>><br />...endearing that she went shopping with her mother for sexy outfits and that she got carried away with fantasizing about her night-to-come in the dressing room.<br /><br />>>>END OF SPOILER<br /><br />In the end I concluded that I like Tiffanie.  That she had guts and that self-promotion was all apart of the package and that I was good with that.  BUT I almost wish this book had been from her mother's perspective.

Had some of these moments taken me by surprise, I can imagine that my feelings for the novel would be much stronger. A good twist really forces you to re-consider everything you've read up to that moment, and in a sense, lengthens the intellectual content. And while someone said in another review that this book is the perfect example of an unreliable narrator, I disagree. The narrator here, Mary-Catherine Blackwood, is indeed totally unreliable, no question, but this is a known quantity from the start. Trusting a narrator of this caliber is foolish and would obviously lead you down the wrong path. Not trusting the narrator, which I didn't from the get go, makes for a less passive read, but alas, a clearer one in which the surprises aren't surprises.

Russel was staying with Brenna, so why would he have to drive out somewhere to meet Peggy Sue to get the present? Why did Peggy Sue not want to give it to Brenna herself? Which Brenna later claimed that she did receive the gift on Christmas Day (but who brought it?).<br /><br />p 188 \"I fought back and sassed my half sister, Sue.\" Should be stepsister.<br /><br />p 189 \"Peggy was a chubby child, and Doris watched her closely, fearful that her beautiful baby girl might truly become fat. Peggy was allergic to eggs and chocolate, and she had to be on a special diet. Instead of milk, she drank Strawberry Quik.\" Strawberry Quik  is a flavored powder (full of sugar) which is mixed with milk, so yes, Peggy Sue did drink milk. Not sure what Strawberry Quik had to do with her \"special diet\" or how it helped her from becoming \"truly fat.\"  \"Peggy had sugar-free candy because she was allergic to chocolate.\" There are MANY candies which do not contain chocolate. Maybe Doris gave her sugar-free to keep her from becoming \"truly fat.\" And could none of the other children have Strawberry Quik, only Peggy?<br /><br />p 194 Jimmie and Doris divorced (when?) and both remarried in 1984. Amy was so upset about divorce she lost control of mother's car on the way to high school one morning and wrecked it. Amy was four in 1963, so she would have been eighteen in 1977. So it had to have happened 1975-1977 - was that when the divorce was?<br /><br />p 195 \"Rob....joined the navy right out of high school.\" \"...shortly after he was mustered out of the service...\" why was he mustered out?<br /><br />p 200 Sweet Sue's wedding - \"her half sisters were happy to attend.\" They were STEP sisters. Only Peggy Sue was Sweet Sue's half-sister.<br /><br />p 215 \"On Sept 15, 2004 Brenna Douglas came into the Island County Sheriff's office in Langley carrying a huge wicker basket...She explained that this was the gift she received from Peggy Thomas...she thought she got it on Christmas Day\"  The police interviewed her right after the murder so what took her so long to bring this basket to them? Was it really THE present? Who did she say BROUGHT her the gift?<br /><br />p 170 Jimmie was a big rugged man with wavy, red blond hair....\"<br />p 187 \"He [Jimmie] had always had flaming red hair...\"<br />Was it red blond or was it flaming red?<br /><br />p 194 \"Shortly after High School Graduation Amy married Mr. DeBoer...\" She couldn't even find out Mr. DeBoer's first name?<br /><br />According to Ann Rule, Peggy's second husband Kelvin Thomas, despite cheating on Peggy, \"always had her back.\" How so? Because he showed up at her hearing?<br /><br />One wedding photo of Peggy Sue and Mark Allen: According to Ms. Rule, Mark had a \"What have I done?\" look on his face and Peggy Sue looked \"triumphant.\" To me, Mark Allen looked tired, perhaps intoxicated, and about ready for a nap. Peggy Sue looked as though she were posing for a wedding photo, trying to look sweet and demure.<br /><br />The repetitions: Over and over we are told that Brenna says she has more friends than Russel and Ms. Rule tells us this is not true. Over and over we must be told that Jean Huden took drugs. Over and over we must be told that there were SIX children from the first marriage of Peggy Sue's father, and her mother had TWO, so that made EIGHT children.<br /><br />The book is poorly written and confusing. Some of the paragraphs have sentences that don't even belong in those paragraphs, or the sentences themselves were confusing. There are a lot of exclamation points used in the dialogue, and in Ms. Rules own observations or opinions. Some of content, especially Peggy Sue's resume, appears to be lifted straight from newspaper articles. It would be interesting to find out the neurosis that possessed Peggy to destroy her marriage to Mark Allen. That was like killing the goose that laid the golden egg. It must have been control and power that she wanted, and she had such a huge ego she thought she could have all that and the money too. Unfortunately for her, Mark Allen did not care to be controlled.<br /><br />I don't know if Russel was a bad guy or not. His wife said he was. His mother did not seem impressed with him. He threw a fit because his store did not have Mountain Dew and he wore a kilt to work one day and a sarong on another day, seeming to think that would be okay in a business environment.

{"label": -1, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Gone Girl? No Way!", "text": "Try not to Breathe by author Holly Seddon a fast paced mystery surrounding a girl in a coma for more than a decade and a journalist trying to find out how she got there.<br /><br />The next Gone Girl?  Absolutely not.<br /><br />Amy Stevenson is a typical teenager - until she is brutally attacked and left for dead.  She survives but is in a coma.  Amy serves as one of the novel\u2019s narrators and the reader is privy to her private thoughts and hopes to gain clues about her attacker.<br /><br />Our other narrators include Amy\u2019s boyfriend, at the time of her attack, and a journalist, Alex Dale.  The story unfolds as each character lends their own insight on Amy\u2019s attack.<br /><br />This book, in my opinion, commits the major sin of any mystery novel - it leaves out all the mystery.  If you\u2019re looking for twists and turns hiding around every page turn - it won\u2019t happen.  The story is pretty straight forward from beginning to end and the reader easily sees what\u2019s coming.<br /><br />Amy\u2019s Voice could be a strong addition to the story telling but it completely misses the mark.  Most of her narration is irrelevant as she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s in a coma at all and spends her chapters wondering where people are and why she\u2019s sleeping so much.  It\u2019s a major disappointment to not have Amy\u2019s character be a stronger voice.  Most of her chapters could be edited out and not have effect on the outcome of the novel.<br /><br />Alex Dale is a highly dysfunctional alcoholic.  She\u2019s lost her unborn child, husband, and job due to her addictions.  Alex is grasping every last straw on a road to redemption and feels a connection to Amy and her untold story.  Alex is such an alcoholic that she wears diapers to bed because she blacks out so completely at night that she wakes to having wet the bed.  Yet she\u2019s supposed to be able to launch an investigation into a 15 year old case and solve Amy\u2019s case.  Not. Gonna. Happen.<br /><br />The one redeeming quality of the novel is actually the writing.  For a story that misses it\u2019s mark - it\u2019s actually well written.  Every novelist has a novel that fails to deliver and I\u2019m hoping this is Holly Seddons.  I would look forward to reading another of her works with hope that the story was a better one.<br /><br />Try Not to Breath is buzzing about the literary world with a lot of hype in its wake.  Sadly, it just doesn\u2019t deliver. The characters are improbable and unlikable. The story has a lot of potential but it never quite makes it to the goal of being an interesting and well told.

It's also a movie, so if you're not one to read, you can watch it and honestly get the entire book + some.<br /><br />I went into this book probably with higher hopes than were satisfied, thanks to several friends who read it and said I absolutely MUST read it. Post apocalyptic? CHECK. Bond between father and son? YEP. Cannibalism? ... Kinda...<br /><br />The writing is an acquired taste. In fact, I started it, then put it down for a couple of weeks, then picked it back up and finished it. If you're a fairly decent reader with good apprehension, you can knock this out in a couple of hours easily. And that's even re-reading a few spots where you just go &#34;huh....?&#34; The writing is good in that it is very poetic in the way he describes the character's feelings and what they are seeing. But it is not &#34;writing&#34; as you might be accustomed to in a novel. The author skips out on quote marks when character's are talking, so there's not a lot of warning that you are shifting into &#34;conversation&#34; mode. Which is ok and easy to adjust to. But he also selectively leaves out punctuation. And that gets a bit annoying. There are lengthy descriptions of some things that you might not find important, and short anti-climactic run ins with danger where you wish he'd elaborated.<br /><br />And as for the cannibalism... the movie goes into more detail on that than the book. I was hoping for some Swan Song-esque violent run ins with gangs. I got &#34;Oh gosh... there are some people. Let's hide. Okay. We hid. They left. We can go.&#34;. If you want your characters to ever be in any peril, other than potentially starving to death, this might not be the type of novel you are looking for. It just doesn't really get the heart-rate up as you panic on behalf of the characters. It feels a little like &#34;Cast Away&#34; did to me; Yes, it's entertaining, but honestly it's also a bit boring.<br /><br />I WILL SAY that I cried like a damn baby at the end. Oh my goodness. The end really hit me harder than I thought it would. Probably because I have a kid, but I just seriously lost it. Which is why it's getting 3 stars. It was a great, well written ending.<br /><br />All in all, I don't regret reading it. I'm actually pretty glad I got past my initial opinion of it and gave it a second shot. It's a good way to kill a couple of hours. But I can't say I'll be reading anything else by this author. I love poetry, I love novels... but I guess I just don't like the two to mix.

But, she's returning home to England because she & her husband are divorcing and there's nothing keeping her in the States. Mel invites Abi into her home to stay as long as she likes.<br /><br />Abi has no children & fears she's missing out on motherhood. Abi's husband didn't want kids. She had agreed but now she regrets it. Mel became pregnant when she was only 19. Her son (Liam) is the reason she never completed her degree. When she was 27, she met her husband (Ben). Liam was almost 6. Liam had clearly been wanting a dad. Ben was more than willing to be that. Together, Ben & Mel have 2 daughters. Imogen, who is 8 & Lilly, who is 6.<br /><br />Liam & Mel talk about most things freely; alcohol, drugs, sex. But, she's never told him who his biological father is. It was a one-night stand; a one-time fling leading to an unexpected pregnancy. She knows his name. But, she chooses not to tell anyone. No one knows, except the guy she slept with.<br /><br />There's nothing discreet about Abi. She's prone to walking around semi-clad. She has tried to seduce Ben.

This hefty volume includes commentary from almost all the surviving writers, cast members and many guest hosts. Also, much space is devoted to memories of John Belushi, Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, and others who had not survived to 2003 when this book was published. This book's style may not be the easiest to follow, although I had no real problem. I think it highlights the transitions from one era to the next, for example, the age difference between Nealon, Hartman, etc. and Sandler, Farley, Spade, and Rock in the early nineties exposes a generation gap. What is fresh and hilarious to some is merely \"juvenile\" to others.<br /><br />The most prevalent feeling I came away from reading this was probably envy. These people got to be part of a small fraternity/sorority that everyone else envies. Bill Murray is quoted saying,\" Having the experience was probably the greatest thing.\"  Instead reading this book is the closest thing to being a fly-on-the- wall I'll ever experience. The show is a pop culture icon, and since it debuted in 1975, there's much territory to cover.  The book allots large space for the first legendary cast and especially Lorne Michaels. You might argue with that, but I won't. Shales and Miller definitely give you and appreciation for Michaels, love him or hate him his show has stood the test of time.<br /><br />The book is long. It deserved more editing in my opinion, although any fan could pick out cast members, characters, or even eras that deserved more space.

I appreciated the organization (addressing a different area each month) as well as the foundation in research on happiness and well-being.<br /><br />I was hoping that Rubin's next book, BETTER THAN BEFORE, would be a sort of follow-up.  In some ways, it is, this time with Rubin more specifically addressing how to manage habits in order to be more happy and satisfied.  Unfortunately, I didn't like this book nearly as much; in fact, I found it was a slog to get through the whole thing.<br /><br />My major problem with this book is something Rubin addresses in her \"A Note to the Reader\" at the start of the book.  She says \"I see habits through the lens of my own experience, so this account is colored by my particular personality and interests.\"  And that is just it--i.e., Rubin's \"study\" of habits is almost wholly based on what has worked for HER and for people she knows.  Her prior book utilized over-frequent quotes from her blog; this one relies on anecdotal stories from her family and friends.<br /><br />Rubin attempts to make her theories adaptable to all by coming up with a theory of what she calls \"the four tendencies,\" or basically, four different approaches to habits.  She calls these the Upholder, Questioner, Obliger, and Rebel.  I didn't find this model, which Rubin refers to throughout the book, to be at all helpful.  Whereas Rubin may find herself  solidly in the \"Upholder\" category, I personally was divided between Upholder and Questioner, and I didn't really respond to the suggestions for either.<br /><br />Using this basic framework, Rubin goes on to create many, MANY more almost arbitrary categories.  Are you a Lark or an Owl (again, I'm in-between).  A Mararthoner, Sprinter, or Procrastinator?  Underbuyer or Overbuyer?  Simplicity Lover or Abundance Lover?  Finisher or Opener?  Familiarity Lover or Novelty Lover?  Promotion-Focused or Prevention Focused?  Small Steps or Big Steps?  And ALL of that is only in the second chapter!  It felt very bogged down, confusing, and often irrelevant, at least for me.<br /><br />Rubin goes on to address the importance of monitoring habits and to discuss the foundation for creating habits.  There are some solid, general tips in this section.  But eventually, she falls back into creating forced categories, such as the series of \"loopholes,\" or exceptions to habits.  Again, there are some good ideas here and there, but they tend to get lost among the clutter.<br /><br />One of Rubin's chapters is called \"Data Point of One.\"  This is probably the best way to view this book--that is, as one person's experience, with suggestions that may or may not relate personally.  Given both that I don't see an overall general application to Rubin's theories and that I really didn't enjoy this book overall, I wouldn't recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "0385348614", "parent_asin": "0385348614", "user_id": "AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA", "timestamp": 1537281790800, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Sex is good and sex is healthy and porn can be a mere thing of enjoyment, or education or sexual exploration.  I loved so much about this book, agreed with most of it and found it very refreshing to have sex and porn discussed so openly and realistically outside of societal judgements.  But I did have one major issue that hindered most of the book for me as it popped up in the beginning.  Writer David J. Ley Ph.D. does not believe in sex addiction or porn addiction. I whole-heartedly disagree.  Yes I believe he is correct when he says often the answer is the problem and answer is not addiction but you.  Simply, you like sex.  That can be true for many but there are also those where the pull to porn or acting out sexually is not really about sex but rather other issues like past abuse and much danger can come to them in life without addressing and understanding these issues.  So I found Ley basically took some taboo subjects and in a fun way gave men permission to enjoy their porn and sex.  Sadly I felt he neglected those with underlying issues who use sex and porn as an outlet.  Unless I missed that somehow.

{"label": 0, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Nice Enough, But Moves Way Too Slow", "text": "Haven Terra is living the typical teenager's life. Great school, great friends, great \"family\"...life is good. Except for the fact that she was abandoned as a baby, left with scars on her chest and back. Luckily Haven was taken in and cared for by Joan, a nurse, and her coworkers. When Haven and her best friend Dante, along with classmate Lance, are whisked away for a once-in-a-lifetime internship at a soon to be opened hotel/nightclub in the Chicago, it's a dream come true.<br /><br />Once the internship begins, the fact that something is \"off\" is quickly evident. Maybe it's the fact that The Outfit, the beyond glamorous staff, act like freakish robots? Or the mysterious book that seems to be communicating with Haven? But how about the fact that Aurelia, her boss, and Lucian, Aurelia's next in command, act plain creepy? When Haven discovers the secrets behind this dangerous group, she faces it head on, determined to save herself and those she loves.<br /><br />Once again, I find myself at odds, opinion-wise, between myself and so many other readers. The cover is beautiful, with the right amount of foreshadowing. A cover like that is sure to put a book on my radar. And a lot of bloggers I know have read ILLUMINATE and have given it glowing reviews. So I was excited to read this one. I was primed and ready to love it. But, it just didn't happen, for several reasons.<br /><br />First, I didn't feel a \"hook\", a strong plot line that grabbed my attention and demand that I read this book. I knew what the hook was supposed to be. It's actually spelled out in the synopsis. The framework was laid out so slowly that I became bored. I knew danger was coming, but I honestly just wanted Haven to get a clue and get on with it. There wasn't this big \"aha\" moment, where things suddenly got real. Everything Haven learned was through eavesdropping and thinly veiled hints during conversations.<br /><br />Another aspect to the story that did not connect with me was the love interest. Upon arrival at the hotel, Haven meets Lucian. Lucian is of course, impossibly gorgeous, wealthy, charming...you know what I'm saying. I just didn't get it. I don't care how hot I am for a guy, if he always cancels dates, disappears for days, and asks me to give him my soul, that's a huge dealbreaker. But maybe that's just me. Not Haven. She falls hard for Lucian and keeps seeing him despite his efforts to damn her for eternity. Sigh. And yes, it may be possible that the devilish Lucian will have a change of heart. Even so, that's a bridge too far to cross, in my opinion.<br /><br />My biggest issue with ILLUMINATE is the fact that the story moved so slowly. Much of the \"action\" was Haven running errands delivering chocolate, or learning the various duties of her position. She did lurk through the tunnels and crawlspaces of the hotel, but not a lot came of it. The revelations, what there were of them, came so slowly that I found myself easily distracted from the story.

{"label": -1, "rating": 1.0, "title": "The Cat Who Should Retire", "text": "Hardcore mystery fans may find it a bit of a stretch, but if your taste runs to expertly written and very light fiction, you can't do better than Lillian Jackson Braun's \"The Cat Who...\" series. Her detective, reporter James Qwilleran, investigates crimes with the aid of his Siamese cats--and the solutions to the crime inevitably rest more upon intution than actual deduction. The premise sounds farfetched, but Braun's work is usually less fanciful than you might expect, and she presents her eccentric characters and stories with great charm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the series has been in marked decline for some time now, and THE CAT WHO WENT BANANAS is a case in point.  On the surface, the plot has possibilities: Qwilleran's interest in a local theatre group's production of THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERNEST opens a path to death that may or may not be accidental.  Unfortunately, the plot goes nowhere and, although the conclusion certainly points to a specific person as a killer, there is no actual resolution per se.  To make matters worse, the prose lacks Braun's light, bemused touch.  While I think it possible that the book has been written from Braun's basic ideas, I think it very unlikely that Braun herself wrote it.  It reeks of \"ghosts.\"<br /><br />This is a tremendous pity, a disservice to both Braun and the reader.  Newcomers to the series should look to earlier works, such as THE CAT WHO CAME TO BREAKFAST or THE CAT WHO MOVED A MOUNTAIN--but the later titles in the series should be avoided like the plauge.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "images": [], "asin": "0515139785", "parent_asin": "0515139785", "user_id": "AEIMW2BKNTFJK7NFEWHVASC4LEYA", "timestamp": 1189194292000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 0, "rating": 2.0, "title": "far too many children", "text": "The Crystal Star opens with a bang, of sorts. The children of Han and Leia have been kidnapped while Leia is out on a diplomatic mission. Leia feels that somehow the Dark Side of the Force must be involved, though the diplomats she is meeting with suggests that it is just the local custom of kidnapping for social status and that it is part of a local tradition. Leia feels otherwise and she is right. The children are kidnapped by the Lord Hethrir who takes the children and tells them their parents are dead. Somehow he is able to block their limited and young ability to use the Force. Meanwhile Han is on vacation with Luke. Luke is searching for missing Jedi and their travels take them close to a planet which is slowly dying and turning to crystal. This is messing with Luke's ability to sense with the Force and Vonda McIntyre gives the reader a very different spin on Luke Skywalker. Rather than the hero, we have a despondent and sluggish man who is not thinking rationally. It is a different spin on Skywalker and may be disappointing to many readers. Luke is less of a presence in this novel anyway as the focus is more on the kids in captivity and Leia's attempts to rescue them. Luke and Han are almost a side plot which eventually gets pulled into the main storyline as it all comes together in a mess of villainy.<br /><br />My biggest problem with The Crystal Star is that it focused far too much attention on the Solo children. Sure, they will eventually become major players in the Star Wars Universe and sure, the readers needs to be introduced to the characters so they don't just show up one novel as fully formed characters who we have not had the chance to get to know, but I think Anakin is three years old, which would put Jacen and Jaina around five. Unless Anakin is only two. I'm not sure, but they are a bit too young to get such a large role. Roger MacBride Allen did a far better job with the children in the Corellian Trilogy which was only set a year or so after this novel. They're no Ender Wiggin, I'll say that much.<br /><br />After the children my complaints have to do with the storytelling. There is nothing wrong with having Luke's mission go poorly, but everything felt rushed. Leia spent so much time wanting to find her children but not really following them until all of a sudden she knows exactly where they are and the kids and everyone end up in the same place with Han and Luke. Sorry, I guess that is a bit of a spoiler, but come on now. Really? The novel might have been better served by focusing soley on Leia and the children with perhaps a cameo at best of Han and Luke. Not the wasted chapters with no real story development, though we do get a bit of Han's past came to light.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Even fans of the Star Wars novels should skip this one. It does nothing, or little to build on future stories (a minor character or two from this book may appear in future volumes as Jedi) and it does not resolve any ongoing storylines. The book is essentially self-contained and reading a basic summary would be just as enjoyable as reading this novel.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry", "images": [], "asin": "0553571745", "parent_asin": "0553571745", "user_id": "AFQDQUAB7UXDT6EMXBTJ3VUOUKFQ", "timestamp": 1160703226000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}

On the one hand, the author effectively uses a historical backstory to add interest and to enhance the plot, but on the other, the present-day characters are unlikeable and their seem fairly stereotypical.  Francie and Colt Hart have been married for 7 years, but their bickering has become commonplace.  On a rare weekend drive from their home in NYC to the \"country\"--aka rural Pennsylvannia--they spy an old house with which they both fall in love:  Francie, because it appeals to the poet within, and Colt, because it is a status symbol.  They purchase the house and prepare to move in, but they soon find themselves in trouble with Francie's brother, a new neighbor, and a long-lost relative of Colt's as well.<br /><br />Francie, Colt, and Francie's brother Michael are all irritating characters; it is difficult to root for any one of them in this story.  Each experiences a transformation that is not quite believable given the circumstnaces.  This is even more true for their neighbor, Randy, who acts in a manner which is completely out of character--although this is acknowledged within the book, it still seems unreasonable.  More interesting and engaging are the house's original occupants, the Musgroves, who built Adencourt one hundred and fifty years before.  The author weaves the tale of the Musgroves into that of the Harts through occasional \"historical digressions\" as well as hints sprinkled throughout the house.

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Not What I Expected?", "text": "The question mark in the title of my review is intentional. I just finished, \u2018White Like Her,\u2019 & well, it took quite a while. I typically get through a book in about 3 hours, but this one just didn\u2019t grip me like most tend to do. It wasn\u2019t bad by any means... it was just rather dry. Perhaps a bit too drawn out with the ins/outs of research? I can\u2019t put my finger on it yet.<br /><br />Note, I\u2019ve not seen more than a couple episodes of Genealogy Roadshow. I\u2019ve not seen the episode in which the author appears, so I have not a preference towards what aired vs. what\u2019s in the book. Moving on...<br /><br />I found the story\u2019s premise an interesting one. Being a Greek who is the fairest member of the family has put me on the receiving end of the, \u2018What are you?\u2019 question\u2014especially as an awkward looking child. It bothered me then, especially since I didn\u2019t understand what was being asked.<br /><br />Unfortunately, genealogy itself bores me to tears. I\u2019ve actually attempted to do research, however, as a screenwriter, I tend to gravitate towards stories that jump off the page. I was unable to feel that, save for very specific parts of this book. I felt the author\u2019s longing for questions that will forever go unanswered, at least by the woman she\u2019d most like to answer them. And yet, just like the author, we\u2019re left with enough speculation about people we\u2019ll never know.<br /><br />Trying to follow the family tree of so & so & why they\u2019re important to a person\u2019s personal narrative is likely incredibly interesting to people naturally interested in genealogy, but for someone like me, speculation & bits & pieces of stories fall flat.<br /><br />The author makes some excellent points about the way Americans look at & discuss race. The book also raises plenty of questions that likely will cause the majority of readers to consider as they relate to their own lives & what they (believe?) know vs. the whole truth. In this way, I absolutely find great value in White Like Her.<br /><br />As a memoir that feels as though it breathes new life in to family members long deceased, well, it didn\u2019t strike that chord for me. As an only child with one parent in their final months - year of life & the other affected by Parkinson\u2019s disease, I have been more interested in family memoirs now more than ever before. I wouldn\u2019t change having read this, but I also can\u2019t say I recommend it above many others.<br /><br />If you love genealogy, this is probably a great choice. If you don\u2019t & you\u2019re not interested in trying to follow stories about how someone\u2019s mother passed for white, left her relatives to do so & later her daughter ends up on a quest to tell you why she\u2019s looking for information on her 3rd great grandparent (and giving you seemingly every detail), leave it on the shelf. It may be interesting to some, but most likely the, \u2018some,\u2019 are likely to be related to you. As it\u2019s not my family, nor am I genealogy obsessed, there was too much tedium & not enough meat for my liking.", "images": [], "asin": "B0752WC1CY", "parent_asin": "B0752WC1CY", "user_id": "AFZGH7RCBMR4SFJAH4WDTRQXA7LQ", "timestamp": 1519517332752, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}

For many their flight was fueled by boredom, or a desire for adventure and the family conflict was caused by controlling parents or an objectionable romance. Lane Roanoke's flight was caused by much more compelling reasons so when she was summoned back to the family farm she would have refused if her grandfather had not told her that her cousin, Allegra was missing. After Lane returned and began searching for Allegra she found only more dark secrets about her family and the repercussions of those secrets to other innocent lives.<br /><br />There are many excellent aspects of this novel. The characters are interesting, and Lane in particular is quite appealing. The descriptions of the isolated town and claustrophobic small town in Kansas is quite well done. The basic premise of the story is distasteful but is understandable given the setting and characters. The author has used the currently popular technique of telling parallel stories from different points of view and in different times skillfully to tell this story.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are also some problems with this novel as well. It seemed obvious to me what was going on in this family long before the novel got there making most of the book rather anti climatic. I also felt there were numerous plot holes in this story. I won't go into details about them because doing so would disclose the plot but others around this family would notice oddities, and it seems unlikely that Lane and her mother would have kept silent for so long.<br /><br />This is still a good read, and well worth overlooking these flaws but it could have been much better.", "images": [], "asin": "1101906669", "parent_asin": "1101906669", "user_id": "AHXWUCTMVBQXDVMDFPA3NO43QF2Q", "timestamp": 1485878884000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

The free form verse is based on statements made by the artist Diego Rivera which they concede may or may not be true.

The tacit approval of terrorism is genuinely offensive, especially in light of the brutality experienced at the Boston Marathon. The verse brags on page 20 that he \"blew up trains\" and bemoans his failed assassination attempt on the then Mexican president. Moreover his treatment of women leaves much to be desired. Apparently it is fine to lie and cheat and have multiple affairs while married. Rivera certainly was not designed for fatherhood, telling his partner at one point he will throw the child out the window if it disturbs him.<br /><br />It is a pity that this book is not focused on what made him famous, his art. It is unfortunate that the author did not use his life as an opportunity to discuss the more challenging elements including politics, poverty and morality. Instead there is just blanket approval.

I also hate the changing POV, because I find it stressful to be left hanging on a plot line.  I find myself flipping throught the book to find the resolution to the problem, rather than trying to move on to the next plot line.  Of all the characters, Kate's story was the most compelling.  I'd have rather read the entire book from her POV.  I have been reading this book for a long time, because it's one of those you can get sick of, rather than propelling you to read it cover to cover.  I did find the story interesting though.

I know what that is, but without my explanation, my child would have had no clue.

{"label": 0, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Plodding Private-Detective Procedural With Lots of Information About Japan and Japanese Oribe Ceramics", "text": "As a work of fiction, PACIFIC BURN is, unfortunately, much more &#34;tell&#34; than &#34;show&#34;.  Much of the narrative consists of factual descriptions of geographical locations in Japan and (to a lesser extent) San Francisco, of forensic suspect-sketching techniques, of &#34;nuclear mafia&#34; groups and nations, of potentially poisonous fugu blowfish dishes, and of Japanese Oribe ceramic art.<br /><br />The plot itself is a superficial private-detective procedural, with action scenes pretty much limited to investigator Jim Brodie's personal martial arts encounters with a Japanese assassin, some FBI/CIA/HAS strongmen, and a District of Columbia &#34;fixer&#34;.  The story skips quite discreetly over Brodie's &#34;action&#34; with his new girlfriend Ries.  Rather distressingly, Brodie seems quite indifferent to the deaths of various policemen and bodyguard employees who lose their lives while guarding Brodie and/or his clients.<br /><br />In the novel, Brodie (a San-Francisco-based Japanese art dealer and half-owner of an inherited Tokyo private security firm), is called to a Napa Valley crime scene to translate the chanting of a Japanese child whose father has just been murdered.  The victim turns out to be the son of Brodie's artist friend Ken Nobuki, who is due to arrive soon in San Francisco to kick off an international art trading agreement, the Pacific Rim Friendship Program (PRFP).  There is no obvious motive for the murder.<br /><br />When exiting an inaugural PRFP meeting at San Francisco's City Hall, Brodie and Nobuki are pinned down by a sniper's fire from atop the nearby Asian Art Museum.  Brodie escapes without injury, but Nobuki is shot in the head and is hospitalized for the duration of the novel.  After Brodie thwarts an assassin's attempt to finish off Nobuki at the hospital, Brodie arranges for protection of Nobuki's daughter Naomi, an anti-nuclear-power agitator who is in Washington, DC.  Naomi may be targeted for death by the Japanese &#34;nuclear mafia&#34; that has been white-washing the Fukushima nuclear power disaster and making only cosmetic changes to the management of nuclear power facilities in the aftermath of the disaster.<br /><br />Brodie then flies to Japan--leaving his young daughter with a neighbor at very short notice--and sets the employees of Brodie Security to work on protecting Nobuki's family members and on identifying the reasons behind the apparent ongoing attempt to wipe out the entire Nobuki family.  Brodie shows himself to be quite oblivious to personal danger, even though his firm's reputation (and that of its employees) hinges on his remaining alive.<br /><br />Although the story's ending is somewhat surprising, the plot usually just plods along, following Brodie's investigative activities and his martial arts fights.  Brodie's character is rather thin--his fatherly thoughts and arrangements for his daughter's upbringing and safety aren't particularly convincing, and his background doesn't seem to fully support his awesome martial arts prowess.  In fact,  I didn't like Brodie well enough to want to read the other series books, even though I'm generally a sucker for any mystery/thriller with a San Francisco Bay Area setting.  For all of the above reasons, I rate PACIFIC BURN at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).", "images": [], "asin": "147679488X", "parent_asin": "147679488X", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1457046351000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

However, I found the style in which this book was written to be very confusing and disjointed.

But even given my level of &#34;ignorance&#34;, I found the author's constant intermixing of information (often conflicting) obtained via official documents with undocumented witness statements and recollections, not to mention statements and recollections of relatives & friends of these purported witnesses, as well as his (the author's) personal speculations, to be neither educational or enjoyable.  I did gain one thing from the book, however - an interest in learning more about the apparently complex, and somewhat eccentric, woman behind the throne, Tsarina Alix.
