I guess I've been let down so many times by poorly conceived, blandly written and inadequately edited books that I assumed 'She Does Not Fear The Snow' would be more of the same. Not so.<br /><br />Bobbie Ann Cole is an intelligent writer who has produced a perceptive and well written account of a significant life event. The heart of the book rests on three catalytic events: Cole's cancer diagnosis, her failed marriage and her examination of Hebrew and Christian faith.<br /><br />In a form of pilgrimage Cole travels from England to Israel, Switzerland and Canada, along the way encountering remarkable people and events. Her guide and confidant is often Terry, an impish, intuitive, serendipitous lover of life who emerges from her log cabin in Canada to join Cole in mystical discovery. The  friendship leads to another person - a quiet, humorous man who engages Cole in ways that surprise her.<br /><br />The romantic interludes may be of more interest to female readers but it is the stunning mysticism that intrigues me. Throughout Cole bravely approaches events that appear to supersede logic. Some are natural: an eagle flying beside her for miles on a frozen river, whitetail deer approaching fearlessly, the menacing, powerful appearance of a moose. And there are unexpected human events including the offering of a rug and its emergence as a map defining Cole's and Terry's natures and perhaps their futures.<br /><br />'She Does Not Fear The Snow' examines suffering, searching, finding and the place of mystery in transforming lives. It is a testament to friendships honed on a crucible of truth. This is an honest book that takes chances and gets away with it.", "images": [], "asin": "0991760425", "parent_asin": "0991760425", "user_id": "AHOG2X5T2FE42UHWVFFF24SKT4MQ", "timestamp": 1389441927000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Two different plots that tangled together nicely with some unexpected twists. However, when reading the author's view on the have's and have not's in the world and how every one \"deserves\" things just because they exist, I immediately became turned off and will not read or recommend this author. Entitlement is a HUGE problem in our society. No one deserves anything. If a person wants to go to college, that's great. Take out student loans like I did. And pay them back, like I did and shut up about it. I didn't expect someone to give me a free education just because I exist. I worked damn hard for it. Then I got a job that offered excellent benefits so I had great health care. Before then, my parents covered my through their great jobs that they worked hard to earn benefits through. No one DESERVES anything just because they exist. There is no such thing as \"free.\"  If you, Daniel, want people educated and insured, who do think is going to pay for that? The rich, you say? Because they \"deserve\" it?  Unfortunately it will be me, the middle class paying, not the rich. I already pay for other people's health care, while I have my own, so I guess I should now pay for their education, too. If someone wants to go to college, pay for it -- student loans are available -- or don't go. It's that easy. Unfortunately, our esteemed President has made it impossible to go without insurance, even if you're a man and don't need prenatal care -- according to law, you still must carry it.

JAMES BENDER PUBLISHING, 2011<br />HARDCOVER, $66.95, 320 PAGES, PHOTOGRAPHS, BIBLIOGRAPHY, ACRONYMS, TERMS<br /><br />The 1930's proved to be a fertile time for demagogues and radical movements to appear in the United States, whether on the left or the right of the political spectrum. Huey Long combined populism with quasi-dictatorial rule in Louisiana while Father Charles R. Coughlin broadcast a popular national radio program blending religion, economics, and politics, lacing it with ever-increasing amounts of anti-Semitism. With mainstream strands of anti-Semitism, popularity of the KKK and worsening economic conditions in the Great Depression, German-American ultra-nationalism provided a voice for thousands in America. This was another side to the \"melting pot\" theory by demonstrating how two different traditions converged in the United States with immigrant families offering new ideas to their local communities. These ideas also united other groups, such as German fascists in Long Island holding rallies with Italian fascists under the American flag. Indeed, the United States didn't escape public displays supporting fascism and the terrain served as grounds for different groups to \"melt\" their ideology together.<br /><br />The German-American Bund boasted in the late 1930s, that it had 250,000 members in 42 states-patriotic Americans all, dedicated to the democratic principles of the United States. Many of its leaders and members were sincere not only in their personal convictions but also in the best interests of their country-the United States. Yes, there were some who had negative attitudes towards Jews and other minorities but then so did the majority of Americans at that time. The author has unearthed that some Bund chapters had working relationships with Hispanic and other minority groups and even had some Jews as members. Yes, they flew the swastika because it was central to their racial identity.<br /><br />Discovering how the local Bund blended fascism and democracy has been made difficult by local hesitations to revisit a negative chapter of the past. This is further compounded when people seek to hide history. One notable example was in 1995 when Suffolk County, New York legislators passed a resolution, sponsored by Herb David (R-Yaphank), \"for the removal of pro-Nazi references on the subdivision records\" from original documents. This proposed re-writing of history on the original records failed since it wasn't approved by the state government. Despite these obstacles, this new book, THEY TOO WERE AMERICANS: THE GERMAN-AMERICAN BUND IN WORDS, PHOTOS, AND ARTIFACTS sheds a whole new light on an often neglected part of local and national history in order to paint a more accurate view of history prior to the U.S. entry into World War II.<br /><br />Author Scott Freeland skillfully uses primary documents to sketch a history of the Bundists as they might have viewed themselves as well as to be more understanding of the German-American Bund members place and time in the history of this country. His book (published by the well-known and respected R. James Bender) is a very detailed and well-written account with excellant photographs accompanying the text. As one reads this book, you are impressed with both the dedication and knowledge the author has managed to put together on a subject that has been not only overlooked but much misunderstood in our nation's history.<br /><br />Lt.

So far, I have bought containers. \ud83c\udf89 I tried last year to grow tomatoes (one late frost took then all out), and strawberries (they migrated to other pots and took over but didn't yield much fruit). I had no idea what I was doing! I'm so happy to have this beautiful, comprehensive guide to growing food in container gardens!<br /><br />I love the organization of this book as well as the overall tone and style. This begins with explaining why container gardening has became important in our times and then moves on to detail how to prepare and gather the materials to be successful. This book never talks down to beginners like me, but it fills in the gaps between buy seeds... Then harvest. That's a big gap, and I love the way this book takes the reader through the process.<br /><br />I feel much more confident as spring approaches that I will be able to successfully grow food in my container garden. This book provides a wealth of information on overall strategies as well as particular techniques to use with different herbs, fruits, edible flowers, and vegetables. If you're looking to grow a successful container garden, this book is for you!

His best hope of salvation is to trust Thuza, a ruby smuggler who offers to help him escape.<br /><br />Beautiful and deeply scarred, Thuza has spent her entire life in a frontier town between rebel and government forces, never choosing a side but trying to make a living from both. For Thuza, the ambassador\u2019s son is her ticket out of poverty. For Than, an ambitious military officer, exploiting those caught in the war offers an opportunity for promotion and distinction.<br /><br />But as all three learn to their cost, in this enigmatic and savage country, everyone has a price.<br /><br />From the heart of Burma\u2019s exotic Rubyland comes an emotional thriller, as three lives are thrown together by the desperate choices they make to survive in a country gripped by civil war: a tale of ambition, salvation and hope that confirms Lucy Cruickshanks as a master storyteller.<br /><br />Michael Atwood, the son of a British Ambassador in Burma goes missing and soon he realizes that he is caught in the war from both the sides and the power they holds on his capture is invaluable, that is when he needs to trust the only person who can help him to rescue from the grips of the rebels.<br /><br />Thuza, the local Burmese girl, is a ruby smuggler, who knows her job well like the back of her hand, on how to differentiate ruby from the rocks, as it is the only salvation to buy her parents' freedom from the right officials.<br /><br />Than, works and abides by the strict rules of the Tatmadaw army, is soon tested on his loyalty towards the Army, and he is forever desperate to climb the ladders of success by pleasing the General. Things change when he forces his son, Min, to join the forces and to take strict measures against those who wrong by the Armed Forces.<br /><br />These three lives in Burma, now known as Myanmar, will break the hearts of the readers as their lives unfold and when their fate plays a major role to bring them together under dire circumstances.<br /><br />The author has once again delivered a spectacular tale of love, freedom and loyalty towards one own government set against the back of another country from the far east- Burma, which harbors a difficult era in Burmese history, which not only torn apart the lives of the common man, but which made it impossible to survive under the dominance of the Tatmadaw army.<br /><br />The author has evocatively captured the time frame as well as the location with her eloquent words. The background of Burma is dominated by lush and dense green forests and the tombs of the many Buddhist temples and that the author has vividly captured in her story line. The land where beauty of mother nature and repressive army plays a major role, is well painted into the canvas of the story as the author strikingly captures the culture, the local dialect and the grief of the citizens through her story. The author has done her research quite well with the ways how to find a ruby among the rocks, where to find it, and also the governance of the army and their torture among common people.<br /><br />The author's writing style is spell-binding that I lost track of time as I devoured the novel in just one sitting. The book is highly addictive as articulate narrative shifts from one character to another. The pacing is really fast, despite the fact that the author has written the scenes descriptively, that made it easier for me to picture the events right in front of my eyes. The story is engrossing and kept me glued till the very end. The author has penned with so much deep, moving emotions and it definitely felt like she has poured all her best emotions into it.<br /><br />The characters are drawn with realism and simplicity. The challenges thrown on their track made me rooting for them. All the three characters are inspiring and sad laced with grief and their demeanor is something to watch out for when they are caught in the politics and the war with the government and they are bound to leave an impression long after the end of this powerful historical fiction. The story has a complex and nostalgic ending that definitely moved me. The supporting characters are highly well-developed.<br /><br />Overall the story is enthralling, thought-provoking and thoroughly gripping till the end set against the back drop of Burma in the late 20th century.", "images": [], "asin": "1782063455", "parent_asin": "1782063455", "user_id": "AETUBLKBW5GFAPS4CXF574L55DQA", "timestamp": 1460301529000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "Prejudice", "text": "To Kill a Mockingbird contains criticism of the prejudice and moral laziness that allowed Southern society to have a double standard of  justice. The novel also presents a somewhat optimistic view of white  Southerners that was somewhat unusual at the time the novel appeared. The  story indicates there are good human beings like Atticus Finch everywhere,  even in the midst of a corrupt society. Even those who do wrong, the novel  goes on to suggest, often act out of ignorance and weakness rather than a  deliberate impulse to hurt others.<br />Another theme of the novel is the  transition from innocence to experience. At the beginning of the story  Scout's world is limited to the boundaries of her immediate neighborhood.  She feels safe and secure, and totally confident that the way things are  done in her home is not just the right way, but the only way. The arrival  of Dill, who comes from a broken home and has lived in another state, gives  Scout her first hint of a variety of experiences beyond her narrow  horizons. Then, on her first day of school, she begins to discover that not  everyone agrees that the way things are done in Maycomb, Alabama, is  necessarily correct. She also learns that sometimes it is necessary to  compromise in order to get along. Even though Scout's teacher's ideas about  how to teach reading may be wrong, Scout must respect the teacher's  authority. Her own father advises her to ignore the teacher's ban on  reading at home, but to pretend to go along with the teacher's methods  while in the classroom. This kind of social hypocrisy is new to Scout, and  she is surprised to hear her very moral father advocating it.<br />Related to  the theme of innocence and experience is the novel's suggestion that  innocent children can often see large moral issues more clearly than  adults. Scout, Jem, and Dill never waver in their horror at the injustice  done to Tom Robinson. The adults in the story, however, see all the  complexities of the situation to the point of being blinded to the central  issue of right and wrong. However much Scout may grow through her exposure  to new experiences, one hopes that she will never lose her childlike  undertaking of justice. In the view of this novel's author, justice is a  simple concept. To recognize the difference between justice and injustice  does not take any special degree of wisdom or sophistication. In fact, the  learned members of the community--such as the judge and prosecutor--and the  proudly religious Baptists who are spectators at the trial are, willingly  or not, allied with the machinery of injustice.", "images": [], "asin": "0446310786", "parent_asin": "0446310786", "user_id": "AHU3DFXHWWRCNVHNIBDAWF5M3UFQ", "timestamp": 966759867000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Lucifer gives each son a task with success ensuring control of the fiendish empire.<br /><br />  \"Jack\" by Kathleen O'Reilly revolves around Lucifer's oldest son, Jack Vassonovich, and his quest to purchase the Book of Souls.  The lovely Gabriella D'Angelis wants to escape the dreary life of a bookstore owner.  Will Jack complete his task or will he learn to love Gabriella instead?<br /><br />  Kathleen O'Reilly's ability to show any redeemable value in cold-hearted bad boy Jack Vassonovich is incredible.  Jack is more used to the boardroom than the bookstore whereas Gabriella knows that the heart is more important than any dollar amount.  The resulting clash is both sizzling and heart-warming.<br /><br />  \"Nick\" by Julie Kenner is the story of Lucifer's second son, Nicholas Velnias.  Nick is a famous painter but each of his paintings captures a piece of the soul of the model.  His task: to capture the entire soul of Delilah Burnett.  Will Delilah's innate goodness overcome Nick's desire to please his father?<br /><br />  Julie Kenner is an extremely talented author with a gift at creating poignant moments out of some very unusual circumstances.  Her characterizations of Delilah and Nick are captivating and very vivid as one can easily apply their circumstances to other real-life situations.  Julie Kenner maintains the heat level as \"Nick\" is a very sensual story.<br /><br />  Dee Davis concludes this collection with \"Marcus\", the story of Lucifer's youngest son, Marcus Diablo.  Marcus is assigned the task of obtaining an infamous ruby called the Devil's Delight.  He'll have to work with old flame, Celeste Abbot, to locate the ruby.  But what choice will he make if the Devil's Delight is located?<br /><br />  \"Marcus\" is an Indiana Jones style escapade that will delight those who enjoy the combination of steamy romance and high octane action.  Dee Davis produces an excellent modern day historical mystery.  The twists and turns will definitely keep readers on their toes!<br /><br />  HELL WITH THE LADIES is an unusual anthology in that all three stories are intertwined nicely into a much larger story.  Each author contributes a piece of the story and the overall themes are well-managed.  Lucifer, while more of a sympathetic figure than one might expect, still maintains his evil status by assigning each son a task to obtain an object that can be used for great evil.  Kathleen O'Reilly, Julie Kenner, and Dee Davis are to be commended for the superb collaborative effort it took to have such a consistent and smoothly flowing anthology.  HELL WITH THE LADIES is definitely worth reading as it provides a unique twist on the ultimate bad boy theme- the sons of Lucifer!<br /><br />COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES", "images": [], "asin": "0425211827", "parent_asin": "0425211827", "user_id": "AFUFW6YBIYQHUXZMT24FOKFY5VJA", "timestamp": 1162059441000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 0, "rating": 2.0, "title": "Humanity Is Not Doomed", "text": "\"Titan\" is a novel about how two astronauts' dream of going to Titan eventually made it possible for life from this solar system to spread throughout the galaxy, but you have to read almost 700 pages of unrelenting pessimism before you get to the payoff.  In describing the book to my brother, I was compelled to point out how the real subtext of this novel is that humanity is doomed.  The book was written in 1996, published in 1997 and describes the adventures of the final crew of the shuttle Discovery during the first fifteen years of the twenty-first century, set against a backdrop of a rapidly declining Earth.<br /><br />The author, Englishman Steven Baxter, gets the development of American society flat wrong.  Disney merges with Coke and forms a monopoly over the web when every other internet provider is shut down.  There is never any doubt that a radically anti-science fundamentalist will be elected President of the United States in 2008.  The U.S. Air Force tries to shoot down America's last manned space mission.  After that, croplands dry up all over the world, segments of the United States secede (but strangely copy the right-wing agenda of the country they're seceding from), and the only really sympathetic character, Apollo veteran Marcus White, is euthanized in his nursing home.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the heroes of the story, Paula Benacerraf and Benjamin Rosenberg, are flying to Titan with three other astronauts who are killed or crippled in nasty ways during or before the landing.  The new President abandons any effort to bring them home so they know they will die on Titan, but they are determined to get some useful science done and broadcast their findings back to Earth.  The focus of the mission changes after a giant bolide propelled by a Chinese nuclear explosion crashes into the Atlantic Ocean: Rosenberg believes their real mission is to store bacterial spores on Titan in a miraculous lake of liquid water, so they will be warmed in billions of years by the expanding sun and evolve into some form of life.  Earth is no longer there to return to even if anyone were interested in bringing them back.<br /><br />This is one novel which I'm glad to say is unfilmable without a complete revision of the plot.  If I were filming this novel I would cast an ex-girlfriend as Paula and her real-life daughter as Paula's daughter Jackie, who is lucky enough to live in Seattle (the Pacific Northwest secedes from the US and becomes New Columbia).  The movie would be about how Marcus White started a space program in New Columbia to build spacecraft capable of retrieving the heroes from Titan and would end with them being rescued at the last second.  The actual ending of the novel beggars belief and is difficult to even describe.  There are lots of better books about the exploration of Titan out there.

{"label": 0, "rating": 4.0, "title": "Could Be My Fav Patterson...", "text": "...and that's saying a lot.  I can see on the surface where the Jester might turn some people (even Patterson diehards) off.  A love story, adventure, mystery all wrapped in the setting of the Crusades?  This is definitely a departure for Patterson and if you go into this expecting Alex Cross I can see where you'd be disappointed.<br />That being said, the Jester has slowly become one of my favorite Patterson novels to date.  I say slowly because I have found that this story has stayed with me much longer than a Cross novel.  This is the type of story that is allowed to stew in your mind and grow with time.  I highly recommend the Jester.<br />Hugh De Luc plays the key role in this novel.  An innkeeper with adventurous ambition, Hugh leaves his family and home to pursue riches in the Crusades.  The Crusade story line does not dominate and should not scare away the casual reader.  The setting merely sets the stage for Hugh's acquisition of a relic that's value is unknown to even him.  Upon Hugh's return home he finds his village in shambles and his family presumably dead.<br />This sets in motion the key storyline of the Jester as Hugh goes in search of those responsible for ruining his life.  A David vs. Goliath revenge story unfolds with Hugh resorting to any means necessary to get close to those responsible for his pain, even resorting to taking up the role of a jester.  Here is able to gain the trust of those responsible and devise a plot worthy of the pain he has endured.  Along the way Hugh gains allies and uncovers truths beyond his imagination.  Patterson's imagery and detail pull you into the story as you root for Hugh in his own personal crusade.<br />Patterson and co-collaberator Andrew Gross tie everything together in a climatic final battle, discovery, and of course a Patterson plot twist.  The plot twist can be seen coming and came as little surprise to me.  While fault could be found in this fact, I still found The Jester well worth the time.  Patterson's trademark rapid pace keeps the pages turning and suspense mounting.", "images": [], "asin": "0316147877", "parent_asin": "0316147877", "user_id": "AFVOQS3RRYYL2L5NPU4WJLFZRI7Q", "timestamp": 1063130810000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Worthwhile", "text": "The book has also been published under the title The Penguin Book of Latin American Short Stories. It came out in 1991 and contained 26 works by as many Latin American authors, from seven nations and Puerto Rico. Brazil, with 10 selections, and Argentina, with 5, were by far the most frequently represented countries; the emphasis on Brazil perhaps reflecting one of the compiler's specializations, Portuguese literature. With the exceptions of pieces by the writers Machado de Assis and Quiroga, who were described as the pair marking the start of modern Latin American literature, the book's selections covered the period from the 1940s to 1990, with special focus on the 1970s and 80s.<br /><br />The collection featured old and new voices, the celebrated and the lesser known, and highlighted writers who created unexpected, dreamlike worlds. Some of the works could be regarded as classics: Machado de Assis's \"The Psychiatrist,\" Quiroga's \"The Dead Man,\" Borges' \"The Circular Ruins,\" Cort\u00e0zar's \"Axolotl,\" Carpentier's \"Journey Back to the Source,\" Guimar\u00e3es Rosa's \"The Third Bank of the River\" and Fuentes' \"The Doll Queen.\"<br /><br />Other writers were well known - Onetti, Rulfo, Garc\u00eda M\u00e0rquez -- but their selections differed from the usual ones in other anthologies. There were other celebrated writers - Amado, Bioy Casares, Lispector, Scliar, Allende, Puig, Arenas, Cabrera Infante, Ferr\u00e9. And then writers who were comparatively lesser known and from Brazil (Armon\u00eda Somers, Murilo Rubi\u00e3o, Joao Ubaldo Ribeiro, Lygia Fagundes Telles, Rubem Fonseca, Paulo Em\u00edlio Salles Gomes) or Puerto Rico (Ana Lydia Vega). Writers who might be considered comparable in their creation of dreamlike worlds but who didn't make it into this anthology: Asturias, Levinson, Pinera, Arreola, Monterroso, Donoso and Peri Rossi.<br /><br />Some of the stories were written in a minutely described, hallucinatory style and/or seemed merely to pile incident upon incident (Borges, Carpentier, Bioy Cesares, Somers, Puig, Arenas, Garc\u00eda Marquez, Rulfo, Cabrera Infante). The one by Cabrera Infante differed from the rest in that it was a humorous parody filled with light-hearted wordplay by the narrator. But many of these stories were nearly unreadable and couldn't be penetrated in any depth. Exceptions for me were works that described the killing of a pig and a participant's revulsion in grotesque and memorable detail (Ribeiro), the shift in consciousness of a narrator who entered a museum (Cort\u00e0zar), and a narrator who sought a character from his childhood (Fuentes). These succeeded in drawing me in to their bizarre worlds.<br /><br />Others were told clearly but in a style similar to folk tales or fables and involved extraordinary, larger than life events and/or fantastic characters, such as a psychiatrist who decided to help humanity by building a madhouse in town (Machado de Assis), a father who went to live in a boat on the river and never returned (Guimar\u00e3es Rosa), a lover who escaped from an angry husband (Amado), a man who found and \"tamed\" a woman (Allende), a magician who could pull tigers out of his sleeves but was worn down by reality (Rubi\u00e3o), and the plagues of Egypt as described by the Egyptians (Scliar).<br /><br />Others were also told in a more or less straightforward and realistic way but created a strong atmosphere of unreality or tension, as in the description of the death of a man (Quiroga), the events surrounding a murder (Onetti), the description of a plot by two characters against a third (Salles Gomes), a female narrator's budding independence from her controlling grandmother (Fagundes Telles), a narrator's description of the menace involved in several relationships, including her own (Vega), and the friendship of two girls at school that crossed racial and class boundaries (Ferr\u00e9). Fagundes Telles' writing was described by the writer as closer to the psychological precision of French writers from the 1940s and 50s than to the naturalism and regionalism (or magic realism) of her contemporaries, which won her comparisons with Colette.<br /><br />Aside from the classic stories, I appreciated this collection most for the many examples of writing from Brazil, for a number of the more straightforward, well-constructed stories, and one or two of the folk tale-like stories.", "images": [], "asin": "0452268664", "parent_asin": "0452268664", "user_id": "AFDKCUVFQ3UUTAV2CHXJX6YXJQXQ", "timestamp": 1210988343000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

Thorn is a big, big believer that believers need the gospel every single day, that believers should 'preach' the gospel to themselves daily.

Entries from the first section include: &#34;He is Holy,&#34; &#34;He Is Present,&#34; &#34;He Is Good,&#34; &#34;He Is Love,&#34; &#34;He Forgives,&#34; and &#34;He Is Father.&#34; Entries from the second section include: &#34;His Humanity,&#34; &#34;His Deity,&#34; &#34;His Poverty,&#34; &#34;His Love,&#34; &#34;His Obedience,&#34; &#34;His Suffering,&#34; &#34;His Death,&#34; &#34;His Resurrection,&#34; &#34;His Reign,&#34; and &#34;His Return.&#34; Entries from the third section include: &#34;He Regenerates,&#34; &#34;He Indwells,&#34; &#34;He Intercedes,&#34; &#34;He Comforts,&#34; &#34;He Teaches,&#34; &#34;He Points to Jesus,&#34; &#34;He Sanctifies,&#34; and &#34;He Resurrects.&#34;<br /><br />Each message is rich in scripture and doctrine.

Transportation and Cargo Security takes a practical yet hardheaded look at the core issues, which gives the reader a superb understanding of the various threats to the transportation system.<br /><br />What is frustrating is that the book often refers to laws passed just after 9-11, yet many agencies and industries are still noncompliant with the many requirements contained in those laws.<br /><br />Transportation and Cargo Security: Threats and Solutions is an excellent reference that anyone who deals with transportation security will find extremely valuable.
