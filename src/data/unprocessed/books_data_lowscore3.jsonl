I had moments where I would have rated this very high and times I would have rated it lower. I landed on a three. Jane is a down on her luck dog walker/petty thief in the very wealthy gated community of Thornfield Estates. She likes to pocket the little trinkets her dog walking clientele leave laying around knowing they'll not miss them. Nor will they care that Jane isn't even her real name. One day she is gawking and nearly gets struck down by the fabulously wealthy, and recently widowed after his wife died in a boat accident, Eddie Rochester. As they grow closer, Jane begins to feel a bit freaked out by the memory of his wife, Bea, and worries about both his and her own past catching up.<br />This is alright. It definitely draws inspiration from the tale from which I'm sure you've guessed. Though I'd stop at that. Don't go into it thinking it's too similar. Although the book is good, the characters were just so unlikable. I guess they were supposed to be but dang! Who to root for? I don't know. Due to that, I really didn't enjoy the better part of it and I wasn't that big of a fan of the end. Now, I am quite negative here but there were also good things. As mentioned, the writing is good. The story is pretty good, just something wasn't there. I just couldn't love it.<br />I do recommend you give this one a try if you are at all interested in it.

{"label": 1, "rating": 3.0, "title": "A cute story", "text": "(3.5)<br />This book is great for anyone who misses/missed the summer 2020 Olympics since they were canceled. This fictional account is the journey of one girls attempt to get there, but really it's mostly about the coaches, but the 2020 Olympics are the goal.<br />Avery Abrams trained most of her life as a gymnast all to make the best Olympic gymnastics team there was. However, when something bad happened her dreams were over and she didn't make it. Her best friend did though. Jasmine didn't just make the team. She also married their coach. Their incredibly verbally abusive coach. Causing a big rift in their long friendship. Her current situation has her suffering a bad breakup from her famous footballer boyfriend and moving back home. Hope seems lost but what kind of story would that be? Not this one! She soon finds herself in promising position as assistant coach to an old crush. The girl they are coaching is so good there is an excellent shot at the Olympics. That's about what I'll tell you I think. The rest of the story unfolds as you read it and follow the lives of all those above and get to see how it all turns out. Of course there are a lot of things that go wrong for a different people here and there but... well, you'll see.<br />This is a well written story with characters you'll enjoy spending time with. I thought some of the things that happened were a bit over the top in some ways but in the end when I put the book down and walked away I knew I'd regard it with fond memories down the road.<br />If it sounds like something you would be interested in by the synopsis at the top and the reviews left, I'd definitely recommend it to you!", "images": [], "asin": "1982121475", "parent_asin": "1982121475", "user_id": "AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ", "timestamp": 1598022316846, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

The basis of this book is interesting. There is a bit of Jekyll and Hyde, a feeling of Frankenstein in the sections that deal with reanimation, and a love story of sorts in between. The unusual main character which has a very mixed cultural background brought a lot to this story, in my opinion, making in unique in yet another way.<br /><br />Impressive descriptions of the city and the especially the shops led the way to interesting connections with the family at the centre of this novel. I particularly liked the good vs. evil feeling of a character more or less struggling to gain control over their own demons.<br /><br />I did feel that this book had steep drop offs where the every day actions of the characters took over the story for pages at a time. The novel redeemed itself whenever something exciting would happen, but there are some rather long stretches where nothing much is going on.<br /><br />The author does a good job of painting a background for her characters that is both believable and enticing. She raises questions about them throughout this novel, never answering them all at the end. There is definitely room for another book, if one has not been written already.<br /><br />Some liberties were certainly taken with the rearranging of facts and dates to accommodate the needs of the writer, but I think for the most part it worked pretty well.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was an intriguing story and a book that fans of Gothic literature will be happy to check out for themselves.<br /><br />This review is based on a complimentary copy from Netgalley and the publisher.", "images": [], "asin": "1606844636", "parent_asin": "1606844636", "user_id": "AFDNLNTANUGENK62RSTAQALJOWPQ", "timestamp": 1410302940000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

The authors are correct in that the first SIGN reading &#34;Sonic&#34; did appear in Stillwater but the first drive-in restaurant itself was definitely in Shawnee. And the Top Hat, as it says in the book, was not a chain. There was one little drive-in hamburger joint in Shawnee in front of a restaurant, the Log House, and owned by the same two guys, Troy Smith and Joe McKimmey. They started their venture about 1954. Troy wanted to concentrate on the drive-in and use a new concept he'd seen in California, the electronic speaker. Joe wanted to stick with the restaurant so the he bought out Troy. They couldn't use the Top Hat name because they discovered a couple of others places already named that, which had nothing to do with Troy's business, so he coined the name &#34;Sonic.&#34; He was building the one in Shawnee when he also bought a place in Stillwater and they got the first &#34;signage.&#34; In 1959 through early '60s both the Top Hat and the Sonic were in existence.

Much of the information is based upon the mysterious and controversial Memorialum Commercatoris manuscript, supposedly written by a Zbigniew Stefanski, alleged to have been one of the original Jamestown Poles. As the story goes, an individual offered to sell the privately published manuscript to the Polish Museum of Chicago, where Waldo was able to view it. We're told the deal ultimately fell through and the mysterious manuscript was withdrawn, never to be seen again. Polish American historians have their serious doubts about the veracity of Waldo's account of this missing manuscript and its contents.<br /><br />From this extremely dubious source Waldo presents the names and backgrounds of the Jamestown Poles, their experiences as glassmakers, homebuilders, and well-diggers along with an account of the Poles saving settlement leader, Captain John Smith, from an Indian attack. The reader is led to conclude that the Jamestown colony had absolutely no chance of survival were it not for those five talented and virtuous Poles. Waldo goes on to make the correlation that, since the Poles saved Jamestown, and without Jamestown, there would have been no Plymouth, the Poles are responsible for the existence of America!<br /><br />I haven't witnessed such a degree of unabashed and baseless ethnic pride since watching Michael Constantine play Papa Gus in \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\"<br /><br />\"Jamestown True Heroes\" is sheer psuedo-history, folks, and another glaring example of Polish chauvinism gone wild.

If you expect the book Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot to resemble the movie, to actually show her dealing with being a princess, think again. This is just another teen romance, and not a very good one at that, and should stay on the shelves.<br /><br />True, I admit that I saw the movie first and so came to the book with certain expectations. For example, I envisioned reading about how tough becoming a princess can be for us average people but how sweet Mia overcomes the challenge with awkwardness and humor. I also anticipated reading pages upon pages about how Mia is trained in all the proper royal etiquette such as how to sit, walk, dance, dress, and talk. Next, despite how cliche the plotline sounds, I expected Mia to eventually endear herself to her the royal staff, incite the jealousy of popular students, and develop closer bonds with true friends. I wanted the story I saw on screen.<br /><br />Yet sometimes a book is better than the movie. And so I think I could have lived with a different book, if not for all its flaws. From page one until the end, Mia complains about her life. In this way Mia is like the girl we see on the screen, except in the book she also swears, lies about most everything, and basically just seems more crude. She also struggles in school, frequently copies her homework off others, and disdains most of her teachers. She likes to shop, wants to be popular, and does not have any interest in doing anything with her life except to date. While these may be on the top of the list for many girls, the emphasis on them in the book makes it difficult for me to believe that she would have the ability to be a princess.<br /><br />Even at this point, I probably could have forgiven the book except for one major drawback. The whole premise of the book is that Mia learns she is heir to the royal throne. This could have made for a worthy twist, except we rarely see Mia being trained to be a princess. Remove a few lines here and there that refer to her royal family or obligations and you wouldn't even know that Mia was training to become a princess.

I felt the premise was paper thin, and the two author gimmick (which does work in some cases) came off like a bad college writing class assignment.  Also, I'm no prude, but it seemed to romanticize a dangerous idea - meeting up with someone you don't know.  In this age of cyber predators, the premise just made me uncomfortable.  I also felt the story dragged as it was very repetitive, the big &#34;reveal&#34; was kind of a let down, and I hated the ending.

I did not find, as others suggest here, that it was boring.  Sad yes but not boring.  I did want to keep turning the pages.<br /><br />I thought the writing was well done and very developed; it would have to be because I found myself disgusted at times and at other times I felt empathy for Nate one of the characters in the book.  The character that I did not like and was disgusted by the most was Nate's partner, Emily.  I found her to be immoral and very shallow.  All I could think about was the couple's baby, Trevor, and how he had a devious mother in Emily.  So for me the author did a good job.<br /><br />The storyline is about Nate and Emily who have left New York because Nate's job, although a good job, can't take care of all the family's needs in Manhattan.  The couple have an apartment rent of $5000.00 per month and his salary is streched with the demands of living in New York.  I did not feel sympathy for the couple because they feel they have been exiled to Newport, Rhode Island; I wanted to jump into that book and tell them to be glad for what they did have.<br /><br />Nate has found another job and has enough money to buy the family a house in Newport.  Emily and Nate, but especially Emily, are ashamed that they have to leave their life behind in New York.Most people would be happy that they have a new home and a new job to go to, particularly in the economic times that we have now in our economy.<br /><br />This novel really makes you sit up and take notice of how people are not always happy and thankful for what they do have.  I felt sad for Nate because he did not have a good family life; his father never showed him any love and affection and he may have passed on something to Nate that will affect the young family for generations.

Sometimes a chapter would start and it would fast forward six weeks. Normally, I would be okay with this, but I felt like I was missing out on relationship building. Chapter after chapter, Finley is struggling with Greyson being a round. Then all of a sudden, its been six weeks and they are in love with each other.

{"label": 1, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Quirky & Fun, Light Mystery", "text": "Dust Angel is a mix between a \"chick lit\" and a mystery novel.  Corinna Leyendecker, the protagonist, loses her job and her boyfriend on the same day.  After some reflection, she realizes she didn't like her job all that much, and that she is unhappy with her excess weight and lack of friends.  After a short stint of job interviews, Corinna has a revelation that she would be happier as a small business owner, and gets to work getting a government grant to start a company that provides household services for busy, executive men.<br /><br />As one might expect, Corinna is lucky enough to get a grant, a loan, and unemployment to start her small company. Somewhat unexpectedly, her primary helper is a punk lesbian from Corinna's former job and the first employee of the company is a friend of Corinna's grandmother.  A nasty, flu-like cold is almost a character in itself, as once Corinna catches the cold, her decision making abilities take a strong turn for the worse.  This leads Corinna into an awkward encounter with a dead man, which is the \"mystery\" part of the story.  However, Corinna is never actually frightened of the corpse, just frustrated and stressed, so the mystery is really more of a case of hijinks than a crime.<br /><br />As in most stories of this type, Corinna overcomes challenges and obstacles to win success, lose and win back her friends, and decides that she doesn't really like her former boyfriend all that much, but is unexpectedly drawn to someone new.  Dust Angel is a light and charming story--a nice book for an afternoon of escapism.  There is a deft, light touch through most of the book which nicely smooths that this is a translation from German.  I hope that Dust Angel gets some exposure in the US, I believe it deserves a place on the 2013 list of \"beach reads.\"", "images": [], "asin": "161109044X", "parent_asin": "161109044X", "user_id": "AFDZ4WWFENGLKRK6DMIU7YE3CQTQ", "timestamp": 1360530137000, "helpful_vote": 32, "verified_purchase": false}

It also contains valuable ideas for any political lesbian who has wondered how she can possibly pay her bills and make the rent while remaining a full-time activist.<br /><br />Who are the women who struggled to form lesbian communities--and how did they fund their activism?  In Everyday Mutinies: Funding Lesbian Activism, two dozen lesbians--including well-known activists such as Martina Navratilova, Alison Bechdel, Dee Mosbacher, and Jewelle Gomez--tell the stories of their activism, with an emphasis on how they support themselves and fund their political activities. Their examples can help you deal with raising and allocating money. Less than 0.3 of all philanthropic dollars are awarded to lesbian and gay projects each year. Yet Everyday Mutinies shares amazing success stories of women surviving, thriving, and making an impact by using the resources they have with intelligence and skill. You will be moved and inspired by the stories behind Naiad Press, The Ladder, Straight from the Heart, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.<br /><br />Everyday Mutinies presents the voices of scientists, political strategists, artists, writers, fundraisers, and community organizers. These courageous women discuss their strategies for getting and using money to pursue their visions, including:<br /><br />* funding scientific studies in creative ways<br /><br />* liberating corporate resources<br /><br />* encouraging responsible stewardship of inherited wealth<br /><br />* getting paid for working on lesbian causes<br /><br />* choosing a job to support activism<br /><br />* financing lesbian media from magazines to documentaries<br /><br />* giving time versus giving money", "images": [], "asin": "1560232587", "parent_asin": "1560232587", "user_id": "AFWVN52MRBWOTIK7UGXBWGOY4HBA", "timestamp": 1160426260000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"label": 0, "rating": 3.0, "title": "Definitely Not Downtown Abbey", "text": "Although this book for some reviewers is reminiscent of Downtown Abbey, my opinion of it is that it is not really quite as well done as the Downtown Abbey that many of us can't live without.  How is it different?  For one thing Downtown Abbey gives more dimension to the below stairs characters.  [[ASIN:0425262588 Rutherford Park: A Novel]] does not.  The below stairs characters are not fleshed out enough and the characters for me felt very one-dimensional.  I think that is what makes Downtown Abbey so addictive.  The characters both below stairs and above have depth and passion which keeps one coming back again and again.<br /><br />This book started very slowly too.  I almost gave up about a third of the way through but about three quarters of the way through,the story did become more interesting.  The story takes place in Yorkshire where William and Octavia Cavendish live at Rutherford Hall.  The opening chapters deal with a maid in the household who has become pregnant. She is found near a river that runs by the estate trying to kill herself and the servants run to save her. What transpires is an ongoing thread throughout the story.<br /><br />Octavia Cavendish is still a young woman since her husband is considerably older than she is.  William Cavendish married her for her money even though her family is in trade.  He needed her fortune to renovate the estate.  He maintains the strictures that the aristocracy live by.  Those strictures are suffocating Octavia.  She has become a shell of the woman she was when she first married William.<br /><br />William and Octavia have a crisis in their marriage and Octavia decides to step out of her cage.  She begins to turn things on their head by the end of the novel.  I felt that the ending was very unsatisfying.  One is left wondering what will happen to the Cavendish family.<br /><br />I do see that there is sequel to this one and I may read that even though this one fell somewhat flat for me.

The family's youngest brother, a missionary recovering from illness and not eager to go back into the field, who was in a hospital suffering from a mysterious paralysis, has vanished. Not only are there no leads, but the family itself, comprised of brothers (included one wounded in the Great War), sisters, sisters-in-law, and an often-addled grandmother, all seem to be hiding the clues that might tell Rutledge where Walter Teller is. Then, out of nowhere, he reappears, just as Rutledge is handed another mystery: a woman, the wife of a Peter Teller, has been murdered in her home in a country village. Is this Peter Teller related to the formerly missing man, Walter Teller? And why was she murdered?<br /><br />In a subplot, Rutledge is assaulted by a knife-wielding young man on a bridge, but the assailant escapes, attacking other men who resemble Rutledge. It is obvious the tough wants to finish the job on Rutledge. Can Ian capture his assailant before he strikes again?<br /><br />As in A Test of Wills, the specter of the Great War is keenly felt. Rutledge's search for the truth was absorbing, but I had a hard time caring about the Teller family at all (even the one person they were protecting), not to mention the neighbors of the murdered woman. Even she turned out to not be very sympathetic. The mystery was fairly complex, even though certain well-placed clues revealed who the husband of the murdered woman was long before the ending.

It reads like a doctoral dissertation Ph.D. thesis - well organized, lucidly presented, academically sound ... and BORING AS [HECK}!!! ... I excitedly bought this book with the hope that it would explain to me the mysteries of the human mind in relation to religion. Instead, I got a 333 page book on one man's ideas about WHY he thinks humans BELIEVE in what they do, and HOW this occurs in society. ... Sounds good so far. The problem is that it just does not go FAR enough, DEEP enough, or WIDE enough into the topic of beliefs. Also, it is presented in a way that is very hard to understand for two reasons: 1. As organized as it is, the reader does NOT know ahead of time WHERE it is all leading. 2. The way this author writes is VERY confusing. ... Listen, I've read over 1000  books in my life - most of them before I turned 30 - and, outside of a few Math Textbooks in math class in college, this has got to be one of the HARDEST books to read I have ever read in my life!

When Sunja finds herself pregnant by a man who is less than available a nice man, a tubercular minister, says that he will marry her and take her to Japan with him. From there the story really just takes off and you get to see so many struggles from inside the family to things as big as prejudices and exile.<br />So much happens in the novel I can't even begin to touch on everything without making this review a mini novel. It's such an expansive and immersive story that you can't help but get hooked and invested in the lives of these characters. This story will make tear you up at times and make you laugh at other.

Examples:<br /><br />1.) Really good dystopian fiction almost doubles as survival manuals. See &#34;Life as We Knew It&#34; for an example. In this post apocalypse world, once A WEEK a 16 year-old girl walks two miles with an M-16 to bring back all the water she can carry. A loaded M-16 weighs about 9 pounds. A gallon of water weighs about 8 pounds. The average person uses a gallon of water a day. It seems unlikely that she could have carried enough water to last a week (56 pounds + 9 for the gun) for two miles with a loaded M-16.<br /><br />2.) The survival items she packs for a long trek somewhere else, in a world where there's no other people anywhere, include Tide and deodorant. Seriously. So there's apparently working washing machines, even without people, and Tide is the brand of choice? You don't even take crap like that with you when you go camping, let alone in an &#34;end of the world&#34; environment.<br /><br />3.) The author describes Cassie's greatest worry prior to this event being whether or not anyone thought she was pretty. That's how you know this is written by a male author. Why is the protagonist female then? I have no idea, but it's not clear whether or not Rick Yancey has ever actually spoken to a 16 year old girl.<br /><br />This is complete garbage, and the praise just makes me distrust reviewers.
