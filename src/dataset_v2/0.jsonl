{"rating": 4.0, "title": "My 3 years in Belgium is ending ... this book was a big help!", "text": "All in all, in my 3 years living in Belgium, I found this a really helpful guide book.  Prices are always wrong in guidebooks, but I found the contact information (web, address, phone) nearly always right, and the descriptions accurate.<br /><br />You will be very challenged to find another guidebook that has this level of coverage of Belgium in its entirety, as most seem to focus on Brussels, Gent, Bruges, and perhaps Antwerp.  Belgium seems to typically be an afterthought on most tourists' itineraries.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the author's picks, both hotels and restaurants.  What can I say to the other reviewer where the hotel unfortunately cancelled their booking because they found a group that would pay them more?  Is that the authors' fault?  No, welcome to Europe, and to Belgium, where the customer is always ... wrong!!<br /><br />So you're browsing guidebooks, and wondering which one to get?<br /><br />I would have to say, based on my experience using an earlier edition of this book for the past 3 years (I imagine they're pretty similar!), if you're swinging through Belgium for 2 days, and going to see Brussels and Bruges, this book is probably not the best for you.  You'll probably do better with a thinner city-specific guidebook.  But if you're going to tour around Belgium, or spend an extended amount of time in a city or two, then the in-depth coverage of this book is a real benefit.<br /><br />One criticim I do have to echo:  Lonely Planet, let's face it, is not known for its maps, and this book is no exception.  They're good enough, and I've never NOT been able to find something, but sometimes the maps, er, well, don't necessarily reflect reality.<br /><br />So all in all, this is a solid book, and if you follow my advice in paragraph 5, I think you'll be happy with it.", "images": [], "asin": "1741042372", "parent_asin": "1741042372", "user_id": "AFISQVMFNIG2GQF2Q4GYIXFZTSFQ", "timestamp": 1214337799000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The will is weak", "text": "This book attempts to answer the question that has been hovering all over, not just in America, but across the world \u2013 Why have so few corporations been prosecuted for fraud? Eisinger begins by reminding us that that prior to 2008, especially at the turn of the 21st century, there have been notable prosecutions of white collar crime by the big boys. Arthur Anderson was first, and it was followed by the three big men of Enron Corporation itself, Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Andrew Fastow. Other Arthur Anderson clients, Sunbeam, Qwest, Boston Chicken, and WorldCom were also investigated.<br /><br /> But prosecuting white collar crimes is not like prosecuting drug trafficking and petty theft. First, as Eisinger says, \u2018White collar crime had to be invented\u2019. He quotes sociologist Edwin Sutherland that white collar crimes were \u2018committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation\u2019. Eisinger goes on to say that such crimes are \u2018nonviolent, economic crimes of fraud, collusion, or deception. Often it is not obvious the behavior is criminal. Embezzlement is as easy to understand as purse snatching. But securities fraud is a more abstract concept. An the historian Laurence Friedman sums up, \u2018The business of America is business; there was a certain lack of zeal for punishing business behaviour\u2019.<br /><br /> Hence, in spite of what we all now know about the recklessness of the people in charge of the banks and big corporations who played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis, there was hardly any prosecution of note. Eisinger traces the history of white collar prosecution, discussing the process of negotiated settlements that covers up most of the cases that might otherwise have ended in criminal trials. He explains the cause of the government\u2019s failure. Here he points a finger at Charles Schumer, the powerful New York senator, who, though not an enemy of regulation, \u2018subtly undermined it\u2019. Schumer picked Preet Bhara to be the US attorney for the powerful division of the Justice Department.<br /><br /> Eisinger says that \u2018Today the justice system is broken\u2026[the Justice Department] has become fearful of losing and lost sight of its fundamental mission to make this country a just place\u2019. Even prosecutions of smaller people and smaller corporations and not involving big banks \u2018face profound problems\u2019. This book is about all those problems. The title of this book was taken from a phrase used by the sacked Attorney-General, James Comey, when he took over the helm of the Justice Department in 2002. He used it in a speech, aimed at inspiring the law enforcement institution. Sadly, it fell on deaf ears.", "images": [], "asin": "1501121367", "parent_asin": "1501121367", "user_id": "AG2DS6RVU3U4YZTESLLKGDZO75SA", "timestamp": 1500305679048, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Bold effort to put Trump's presidency into fuller biographical context", "text": "Haberman has been reporting on Trump for years. On the negative side, sometimes she's let him use her to get out his own message in the New York Times. On the positive side, she appears to see through him now. When he says (in front of his aide) that he \"loves her\" and says she's \"like my psychiatrist\", she recognizes the tactic for exactly what it is--the usual schtick to ingratiate himself with someone and manipulate the message.<br /><br />This was heartening to see. There is less \"both sidesism\" than I expected, and more clear-eyed exposition of who this man is and the damage he has done to the country. As she points out, there was ample reason to not take him very seriously as a cartoonishly larger-than-life NY celebrity real estate developer/self promoter.  Now, however, he has become a serious historical force.  Like it or not, everyone needs to take Trump, his message and his \"movement\" seriously, and Haberman does--while providing many anecdotes that would be comical if they were not so alarming and so dangerous.  I haven't figured out yet if the 600+ pages are really necessary as it's a long slog at points. On the other hand, it's Trump, so probably the answer is \"yes\". I will say that I'd stopped buying Trump books, despite the rash of interesting new ones out, but broke down for this one, and don't regret it.", "images": [], "asin": "0593297342", "parent_asin": "0593297342", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1664928583025, "helpful_vote": 288, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "3 in 1...what a deal!!!", "text": "It's great when one of your best friends just happens to own a book shop. I found this trilogy of Nora's in the book shop and got a great deal on it. I think my favorite was Finding The Dream, with Laura Templeton & Michael Fury, probably because he's the handsome, dangerous type of guy that every woman wants to fall in love with.  And he struggled to be good enough for where he  finally ended up. And she was so level-headed in so many ways, except the creep of a husband she was married to. Laura struggles with her two daughters after she divorces their father, with the oldest blaming Laura for his departure. Kids can be so cruel when they don't understand. The story just took me to tears at times. Then too, I really enjoyed Daring to Dream with Margo and Josh Templeton. She finds out about her mother's one and only love, Margo's father, and Margo regains a relationship with her mother that she'd felt was lost. Margo is the beautiful, well-built woman that every man dreams about, but she's a wild child that Josh Templeton has long been waiting for to return home. The dialogue is great, both witty and warm at the same time. Margo is nearly bankrupt when she returns to Templeton House, but finds her roots again, not only with starting a new business, but also with her mother. Josh was my second favorite of the men in this trilogy. He's so cool.<br /><br />And then there's Holding The Dream with Kate and Byron. This story was okay, but not nearly the page-turner that the other two were. But Kate is an altogether different type of woman than Laura and Margo. It's the bond that holds them together as sisters, even though they aren't, that I really found endearing. This trilogy was great.

Also, the book took a bit of a Twilight twist during the &#34;present&#34; part of the book. It was a little disturbing that a 600 year old lady was sleeping  with a 16 year old boy and kept repeating high school over and over. I enjoyed the &#34;past&#34; much more and found myself skipping whole &#34;present&#34; chapters. All in all it was ok.

She was solid, purposeful and while she did have some moments to whiny teenage angst, they were mostly justified (what with witnessing her parents murders as a child).  I LOOOVED the character Black Knife.  Jodi Meadows has a way with her male leads that draws you in with the first meeting.  The world building was adequate.  The world itself, fascinating and mysterious, however, our interaction with it as the reader was somewhat limited.  There are several novellas planned in the series, unfortunately, I do not think they will be enough to quell my desire to know more about the world and the ancillary characters involved in the story.  Overall, I did grow to really enjoy this novel and am sad that it is only a duology as I think there is so much material smooshed into this one book that could have been developed in a longer series.<br /><br />Final Recommendations:  if you love high fantasy, mysterious organizations, even more mysterious vigilantes, swoony romance, royal jerks, strange magic", "images": [], "asin": "0062317385", "parent_asin": "0062317385", "user_id": "AGKXACINPQNH5PBKKDYEUCOLVGDQ", "timestamp": 1430235318000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

However, if the only thing you've seen of Piers Anthony is his Xanth series that is so popular, then you may want to screen this for the kids. All of these books deal with adult issues. You can judge whether someone is mature enough to read it, but all the books in this series follow a girl who is suicidal, the older man she loves and who loves her and their various companions. They deal with issues like suicide, rape, sex, etc... They do it in good way that is relevant and fits into the story. The story is about a girl Coleen, who was raped at a party once. Her father is an adulterer and her mother is a drunk. She puts on a good act and is a very popular girl on the outside, but cuts her self and frequently contemplates suicide, though she's very smart. One day on the way home from school, she comes across a man passed out in a ditch. Her suicidal nature leads her to take him home. After learning a little of each others language, he says that he's from another world/mode and that he wants to take her to be his wife there. She doesn't believe him and he disappears. She believes him and realizes she's made a mistake and he realizes he shouldn't have left. The method he takes is random though and the only way to reliably get back to Coleen is by invoking a virtual mode. The rest of the story is about how Coleen and Darren are trying to find each other and get back to his mode. They continuously encounter problems and solve them with the help of their friends from the other anchor modes. The whole time Coleen is trying to deal with her issues so that she can be with Darren in a health relationship. So there are many different things going on in this series and I have just gone over the general gist so that I don't give anything away. Everything is done in a tasteful manner, but as I said it contains very adult subject matter.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I dunno, electricity is nice.", "text": "This review originally published on the DRTTMK website.<br /><br />It's kind of a maudlin book. The main character is the personification of a little house that is built out in the country. \"The man who built her so well said, 'This Little House shall never be sold for gold or silver and she will live to see our great-great-grandchildren's great-great-grandchildren living in her.\" It talks about how the house is in the countryside, and at night she watches the stars, and what it's like in the different seasons. She hears about the city and kind of wonders what it's like. \"One day the little house was surprised to see a horseless carriage coming down the winding country road.\" Then they build a road next to her, and build more houses and gas stations, and then more roads, apartments... Everything crowds around her, but no one wants to live in her so she just kind of stays there. There's a trolley that goes by her, and an elevated train in a subway, and then they tear down the apartments and tenements next to her and build up skyscrapers, and she feels terrible and nobody's living in her and she's all broken down. Then one day, \"Along came the great-great-granddaughter of the man who built the little house so well.\" And she says, 'Hey, it looks kind of like my grandmother's house when she was a little girl, except that was out in the countryside.' And they realize that the area used to be countryside, but isn't anymore. Then they go to some movers and the movers say, 'Yeah, the house is well built so we can move the house somewhere else.' So they put her on a truck and take her out in the middle of the countryside and paint her and fix her up and then she's happy again.<br /><br />It's another one of those books decrying industrialization. If you think about it, that little house built back before cars and before any roads were in the area wouldn't have had air conditioning or central heat. It probably didn't even have indoor plumbing if it was so isolated. Obviously, it could be retrofitted, but the book just seems nostalgic for the past, like it's saying that things were better back when everything was countryside and we didn't have roads and cars and things like that. But there's so many trade-offs that it doesn't take into account, and it's a very simplistic and naive way of looking at the world. It just boils down to a house that likes living in the country, and then the country changes to a city, and then somebody takes her back to the country so she's happy again. Looking at it from the house's standpoint, it's a perfectly reasonable story. It's not great, but not bad. And it's rather dated.<br /><br />Message: Some houses prefer to be in the countryside.", "images": [], "asin": "039525938X", "parent_asin": "039525938X", "user_id": "AH4XKRSSSWAO6CZ5WH66V6PIQJTA", "timestamp": 1566913208013, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Authentic, vivid, and heartbreaking", "text": "I am, perhaps unsurprisingly, a very big fan of Cormac McCarthy's western novels.  And horses.  After my acquaintance with both, I can say with no reservations that the way Hagy writes horses and the west is authentic and vivid.  While Will Testerman occupies many more pages of narrative than the horse of the title does, Boleto (or \"Ticket\") is by far the most tangibly drawn character in the book, and not just because we know what color she is.<br /><br />I was strongly reminded of McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679744398 All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, Book 1)]] in many ways, but Hagy has her own voice.  Testerman is in many ways an admirable character and a pleasure to read about.  Even if he does live under a sense of constant failure, he has a real heart for serving others, even when it's difficult.  The themes of the human-horse relationship and betrayal were powerful ones, and used well.  At a crucial point in the story (won't spoil it), I felt my stomach drop along with Will's, and I very nearly cried at the book's conclusion.<br /><br />Perhaps the only thing I can say negative about the novel - and it's no small thing - is the gratuitous sex (and extremely gratuitous, vulgar descriptions) throughout.  When reading McCarthy's [[ASIN:0679760849 The Crossing (The Border Trilogy, Book 2)]] in class years ago, a classmate said \"This isn't realistic at all - he doesn't have sex!\"  Well, Testerman certainly makes up for Billy Parham's celibacy.  I don't expect Testerman to abstain from all female contact - but the explicit and unnecessary descriptions of his many, many encounters, while they didn't completely ruin the book for me, made me decide against keeping it.  I can't ever imagine wanting to reread those passages again.<br /><br />I'd love to read some of Hagy's other work - this book has certainly given me a taste for it.  She knows how to use her words economically and with restraint, while still allowing expression for sublime beauty.  I just wish she didn't think she had to be vulgar to be realistic.", "images": [], "asin": "1555976123", "parent_asin": "1555976123", "user_id": "AHEOLOIZT47FG5M5J57547DMPILQ", "timestamp": 1330987590000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

This is the story of Hippolyte, to me an annoying, unlikeable and dirty smelly explorer type (hmmm...the heroine in The Tattooed Map was also none too clean..)who sets out to find some islands that supposedly do not exist. Sounds like a good story, right? Well, it would have been, except that the bulk of the story consists of Hippolyte trying to convince his editor that his journey was fact and not fiction, as she believes. This is done mostly through letters and notes of historical facts sent back and forth. The &quot;finding the islands&quot; part was way too small, and the rest of the book was sooo boring that any mystery etc. regarding these islands is overshadowed by the simple fact that I didn't want to read on. Also, there is some kind of completely unbelievable romance type thing beginning between Hippolyte and his editor Marie that begins to make the book a little bit more interesting, but it never fully develops into anything. Because I paid full price for this book, I forced myself to finish it. I must say that the illustrations did distract from the boredom of the continuous facts and figures in the book, thus raising it's rating from two to three stars.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Dame Agatha visits the supernatural", "text": "This series of interlocking short stories is unusual in that Christie's mysteries usually centered on the everyday aspects of life, whether they were set in a small village or some exotic location the mystery usually revolved around the average, mundane bits of daily life.  Except for her few plots involving mysterious Master Criminals, a reader could quite easily imagine the story taking place in the house down the block or at last year's vacation spot but this one is very different.<br /><br />The stories begin quite conventionally, Mr. Satterthwaite is a wealthy, elderly bachelor.  He knows everybody and even though he is a bit of a busybody and gossip, they either know or want to know him.  His life has been and is interesting and fun but Satterthwaite has begun to feel that perhaps he has been missing something, at this point he mets the enigmatic Harley Quin.  Mr. Quin will listen to what Satterthwaite has to say and then just make a comment or two that will point Satterthwaite in the direction of something quite interesting.  As a result of these encounters Satterthwaite rights some wrongs, solves some crimes and reunites lost loves.<br /><br />It is never quite clear whether Mr. Quin is real or not.  He manages to just appear at a critical moment, and to know just the right bit of information to set Satterthwaite in the right direction and then disappears.  At times Quin is visible to, and interacts with others, but at others only Satterthwaite can see him.<br /><br />Even though there is a touch of the supernatural about these stories Christie, as always, plays fair with the reader.  The clues are all present to solve the mysteries in these stories although the true focus here is on the romance rather than the puzzle.

While the novel gets off to a slow start early on, it begins to pick up the pace, and you can't help but want to continue reading. There is a tender melancholy that begins to pull you in.<br /><br />Fresh off a broken engagement, Ruth quits her job and moves back home to take care of her dementia-addled father. Told via journal-style, we follow Ruth as she explores her relationships with her family, friendships, even the unsteady footing of a new romance. Ruth is not an organized storyteller so readers expecting a linear storyline might be disappointed. However, I found that it worked in the novel's favor.<br /><br />I liked that we didn't dwell too deeply in the far past. I think had the author done that, I would have been taken out of the story fairly quickly. We stay in the present with Ruth, as she reflects on the end of her engagement with Joel, her re-readings of her father's diary entries. Howard, a history professor, is witty and human, and certain interactions just break your heart. As you get to the end of the novel, it begins to feel like it's speeding up, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />For a novel with a heavy subject matter, it didn't feel overwhelming or depressing.

Fun!<br /><br />We see some of the same themes in this book as we did in the first two. Renna's, Brandi's, Jaimie's, and Leith's faith will be put to the test. Renna has the realization that she's been trying too hard to fix things, and she has to let God take control. Brandi thinks she has to be the happy one, and it nearly crushes her. Leith decides he is willing to sacrifice anything to help the ones he loves. All realize that people, even Respen, aren't the true enemy, and that God can call anyone to be His child.<br /><br />I don't like torture. I like when characters are in pain (wounded, not crippled, dying but knowing they'll recover), but I don't like torture. It's messy and ugly. Thankfully, TM glosses over most of the gory stuff. People are whipped and burned and bandaged.<br /><br />Brandi's deception didn't work for me, deciding to join the army.  She doesn't know how to fight!<br /><br />I liked that the king lived, that Leith saved his life by failing to kill him.<br /><br />The romance was good. I liked that they did a lot of hand-holding (Brandi noticed there was so much hand-holding!) rather than a lot of kissing. I don't feel like there was one conversation where they sat and talked enough to get on the same page with their feelings and hopes, though. They both just assumed they liked each other and went from there.<br /><br />Writer thoughts:<br />I love the naming scheme TM has going here. Dare, Deny, and Defy. 1, they're all four-letter D words. 2, they're all verbs of resistance. 3, they progress from mild refusal to outright rebellion. 4, they explain Leith's character growth and the plot all in one.

Mick was a famous singer who fell in love with June, the daughter of The Costas who owned fish & chips joint in town in 1956.  Through flashbacks we learn much about their rocky relationship and life together how it affected the lives of their four children through the lead up of the big end-of-summer bash on August 27, 1983, that gets out of control and ends in disaster.<br /><br />A love a good family saga and think this one has that feel. This is definitely a character driven story and the author does a great job letting the reader get to know each of the Riva siblings and to and lesser degree, parents June and Mick. I loved the strong sibling ties. By far, Nina was my favorite character, a gorgeous model, fabulous surfer but someone who with a sense of responsibility to others and someone who  put the needs of others above her own. I liked June and Riva's story and that invincible feeling when young and in love that sometimes makes one overlook the obvious. I liked the Malibu beach scene and the 1980s vibes: the sun, the surf, the music and the fancy free lifestyle. My least favorite aspects of this story was the details of the rich and entitled party attendees who seemed to do everything in excess. There was plenty of booze, drugs and sex in this novel as well. Overall I liked this story even though some parts were overdone.<br /><br />This is my second novel by this author, Daisy Jones and the Six was my first and one I enjoyed.  I gather that Mick Riva was one of the husbands in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo but I haven't read that one yet.<br /><br />RATING:  4/5<br /><br />Thanks go to Random House Audio for allowing me access to this book in exchange for my unbiased review. The audiobook was read by Julia Whelan who did a great job.", "images": [], "asin": "B08L9QD4NH", "parent_asin": "B08L9QD4NH", "user_id": "AHAR2ITQ3O2FJJDLIORAQ226KZHQ", "timestamp": 1626451167618, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

He also included many black and white illustrations that reinforced what was taught in the text and made it clear. The book was packed full of practical information on how to become weather-wise. This book was first written some time ago (in 1949) and was based off of articles that the author wrote for sailors and aviators.

The setting is a Human Resources department in a New-York-based consumer research corporation, which has gone through several rounds of &#34;down-sizing&#34; due to the economic climate.  The novel opens in late 2009 with another round on the horizon.<br /><br />Rosa Guerrero is the Executive VP/Human Resources Chief who has devoted 15 years of her career to the corporation.  A childless widow, estranged from her siblings, she is approaching retirement, but dreads the loss of her purpose in life and her work &#34;family.&#34;  Rosa has been a stellar leader with the ability to balance corporate goals with human needs.  Consequently, she is well-respected and has engendered loyalty from the CEO and her staff.  In the midst of the looming reorganization, Rosa suffers a health crisis that compromises her mental faculties.<br /><br />The author has captured a cross-section of human nature with the characterization of the staff, ranging from caring to cunning, compassionate to cruel, committed to apathy.  In other words, this is a typically flawed collection of humans forming a sometimes productive, yet dysfunctional work &#34;family.&#34;  The characters are interesting and well-developed, but oddly I didn't seem to form an emotional connection with any of them.<br /><br />My one criticism is that the plotline got bogged down in repetition.  While I started out fully engaged, I found my interest waning as the book progressed due to redundancy among the different chapters highlighting individual staff members.

She doesn't cook unless she has to, and even then, she takes *gasp* shortcuts.  Meeting Mike Flynn at her sister's wedding, she is at once intrigued and surprised by the feelings he invokes in her.  She can't help but notice how much he favors her now deceased fianc\u00e9, and while it unnerves her, she is still attracted to him enough that she wants to see what happens.  Plus, there is nothing like a good mystery, and Annabelle is determined to get to the bottom of this one.<br /><br />Mike Flynn has been taught by his mother from an early age to take care of himself.  He doesn't mind cooking and cleaning and running a household. Life as a physician doesn't give him much opportunity to do so, but when he does, he relishes being able to take care of someone he likes.  Annabelle Ronaldi is such a person.  Meeting her at her sister's wedding, he is instantly enchanted and utterly charmed by her.

Intrigued by, but also attracted to Mike Flynn makes Annabelle want to keep him for her very own. The fact that he is the exact type of man she desires plays heavy on her mind, and she falls for the handsome doctor.  Their sinfully sexy first night together was sensuous and heady.  Both characters fell hard for each other, and that in turn made this story that much more entertaining.<br /><br />Robin Kaye spins the tale of Mike and Annabelle in such a way that I felt their emotional ties and their lusty thoughts.  From Annabelle's fun loving Italian-to-the-bone family to Mike's single but dedicated and loving mother, I didn't miss a single breathtaking word of this fine novel.  Readers will be hooked on TOO HOT TO HANDLE. I know I was!<br /><br />Natalie S.", "images": [], "asin": "1402217668", "parent_asin": "1402217668", "user_id": "AHT5HMK6QYOW3JYD4YTVK4RSIWZQ", "timestamp": 1240774392000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Review: Siren's Storm", "text": "his is one of those books that I really wish I could give it a higher rating.  I really liked parts of it.  But, there's always that one things that hold it back.  And really, for me a 3 isn't a bad rating.  It's just that I think there are better books out there.<br /><br />I felt like I didn't really connect with Will.  At times, I felt like his character was all over the place.  Granted with the tragedy in his past, I kind of understand.  Especially when you factor in the idea that he has no idea what happened.  He also has a lot on his plate dealing with his best friend, Gretchen.  Her sleepwalking habits often left me agitated.  Her obsession with Asia also felt forced.  She just sort of shows up in town and he can't help but wonder about her.  I also wanted to him to wake up and see what his obsession was doing to Gretchen.<br /><br /> I really did enjoy the mermaid/siren folklore in this story.  It includes the story of Calypso, and her obsession with Odysseus.  When he left her, she was overcome with need for revenge.  It was an interesting twist to the story.  I enjoyed Asia's connections with Calypso and what she's required to do.<br /><br />For some reason, I found the overall story extremely slow moving.  It felt like there was hardly any action to drive the story forward.  It wasn't until Asia tells Will the complete story of who and what she is that the story felt like it was going anywhere.  And then it was over.  It left me with some unanswered questions and the thought that there will be a sequel.", "images": [], "asin": "0375842454", "parent_asin": "0375842454", "user_id": "AH3JFU65CZRULF7KCJKUXMV37XKQ", "timestamp": 1312833581000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Outstanding collection of interviews and articles", "text": "Around the 1950's, the studio system of Japanese film started to show cracks.  Not large cracks, but big enough that a few ambitious rebels could squeeze their fingers in, and start breaking molds and showing their own individual styles.  Crazy psychedelic colors, hot warrior chicks with big floppy hats and big guns, rice-sniffing assassins...Japanese film got a whole lot more interesting.<br /><br />Author Chris Desjardins describes these \"outlaw masters\" as \"the directors coming out of the Japanese production lines of the late fifties, the sixties and the early seventies: genre filmmakers who made genre movies usually labeled as samurai, yakuza, horror, pink, etc, but who pushed the envelope beyond the usual conventions in some way, either in style or content. \"  These are the men and women who didn't mind working in the \"b-films\" because of the freedom it gave them to create their own vision and keep pushing boundaries of sex, violence, politics and style.<br /><br />In much the same way as [[ASIN:1903254434 No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema]], \"Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film\" springs from a series of film festivals and director retrospectives, in this case from The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles.  Film programmer Dennis Bartok and author Chris Desjardins shared a passion for the edgy, hard-boiled cinema that came from Japan during these times, and the actors and directors who exemplified it.  They put together the \"Outlaw Masters\" series starting in 1997, and have been bringing these fantastic films to a wider audience ever since.<br /><br />This film festival gave them insight and access to these directors, many of whom were not even aware that their work was appreciated outside of Japan.  Each section of this book contains a short biography and filmography, followed by an interview.  There are fourteen featured in all, twelve directors and two actors.  Some of these, like Fukusaku Kinji ([[ASIN:B000F4LPJ6 Battle Royale]], [[ASIN:B0002V7O1A Battles Without Honor & Humanity]]), Sonny Chiba ([[ASIN:B00006JMRZ Street Fighter Saga]], [[ASIN:B00068ULLY Kill Bill]]), Suzuki Seijun ([[ASIN:B0000YAEI4 Underworld Beauty]], [[ASIN:0780022041 Tokyo Drifter]]) and Okamoto Kihachi ([[ASIN:B0007989YS The Sword of Doom]]).  Some, like Kaji Meiko ([[ASIN:B000AYNFV2 Lady Snowblood]]) and Ichii Teruo ([[ASIN:B000RHMQJE Horrors of Malformed Men]]) are a little more obscure except to hardcore fans. As well as these classic film-folk, two of Japan's \"modern outlaws\" are included as well, Miike Takashi (Ichi the Killer) and Kurosawa Kiyoshi (Cure).<br /><br />All of them are fascinating, giving intelligent and informed interviews.  Many of these interviews, in fact, are featured in video form as bonus features on some of these director's DVDs.  I know I have seen a few of them, but it is a real treasure to have them all collected in book form.<br /><br />It is also fantastic to live in the age of the DVD.  If I had picked up \"Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film\" a few years ago, I probably would have been frustrated at the lack of access to all of these cool flicks I was reading about.  Nowadays, however, almost all of them are only a search away.  If you like Japanese film, you are seriously going to enjoy this book.", "images": [], "asin": "1845110862", "parent_asin": "1845110862", "user_id": "AHR7ZC2G4VF4MEJMXTZANR23OJ6Q", "timestamp": 1236728328000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Taut, Smart, Dramatic Little Thriller", "text": "It's not hard to see why Hitchcock made John Buchan's \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" into a film (which I have not seen).  It's a taut, smart, dramatic little thriller, full of the unlikely events Hitch really grooved on.  I was quite pleased at the end of this breezy novel, which is a pretty obvious source of LeCarre, Fleming, et al.  It's also a marvelous example of fiction incorporating the zeit geist of the era in which it was written.<br /><br />Richard Hannay, late of South Africa, finds himself terribly bored in London, 1914 (which, having been to London, can't possibly imagine), until he meets the mysterious Franklin Scudder.  Allowing Scudder to live in his home, Hannay is astonished by Scudder's bizarre raving tale of an elaborate conspiracy to initiate war among the European powers.  Hannay takes this story with a bit of skeptisism until he comes home one night to find Scudder pinned to the floor by a knife.  Thus begins an elaborate and episodic chase, as Hannay, fully believing Scudder's claims, must run from the police and from the conspiracy, the Black Stone.<br /><br />Buchan is most successful in creating Hannay's elaborate schemes and escapes.  Hannay is a likeable hero, so the reader readily roots for him.  Further, the villains, while never fully developed (it is Hannay's story), make for sinister threats just off-page, so to speak.  The denouement is satisfying, if more than a little tragic.<br /><br />This book is also fascinating because the conspiracy, with changes in detail, basically mirrors the events that ignited World War I.  Various radical interests seek to assassinate a prominent figure (although Princip had no idea of the consequences of assassinating Franz Ferdinand), and trip the various political alliances to start a war.  Thus, Buchan incorporates the weird mixture of patriotism and panic that most historians point to when they chronicle the First World War.<br /><br />The downside of that zeit geist is that Buchan incorporates a certain level of anti-Semitism, some of it being of dubious necessity.  Scudder is convinced that Jews are responsible, because they want Russia to be destroyed by the war.  While we later learn that Scudder had prejudices against Jews, Scudder himself acknowledges the anti-Semitic history of Russia.  Another occasion, Hannay makes an analogy that plays on the stereotypes of Jews as being wealthy.  Again, that is probably an accurate reflection of the times, but it is uncomfortable.  To Buchan's credit, the conspiracy is more than simply an \"evil Jewish plot\" (it's telling that some of the rhetoric Buchan uses is still floating around today).<br /><br />Nonetheless, as with most older literature, you have to take the prejudices in context of when the book was written.  \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" is not an heir to the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".  It is an exciting thriller, featuring a heavy does of suspense and intrigue.  Simply put, it's a blast.", "images": [], "asin": "0486282015", "parent_asin": "0486282015", "user_id": "AFTRQJPXDBG2C5LKZWPUU4EC3YVQ", "timestamp": 1103933483000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Jake Blake Goes for a Wild Ride", "text": "First published in 1956, Wild Wives is a short but very entertaining novel from Charles Willeford, the author of Miami Blues and a number of other crime novels.<br /><br />Jake Blake is a struggling San Francisco P.I. who lives in the same cheap hotel where he has his office. One slow afternoon, Florence Weintraub, the inevitable Hot Babe essential to the beginning of practically any classic P.I. story, waltzes into his office insisting that she's desperately in need of his help. Even though she's twenty-six years old, her father allows her absolutely no freedom whatsoever and has her accompanied wherever she goes by two goons who are allegedly there to protect her. She'd just like a couple of hours to herself, she says. Could Jake possibly help her lose the two thugs?<br /><br />Well, of course he can, for twenty-five bucks a day plus expenses. And when the lovely Florence agrees to the terms, one thing inevitably leads to another. Florence is very attracted to Jake and once they finally elude her guardians, they go out to dinner, which Jake naturally adds to the expense account. Other more interesting activities accompany the dinner, and Florence insists that she'd like to see Jake again the following day.<br /><br />Complications ensue and poor Jake soon finds himself entangled in a mess he never envisioned when he accepted Florence's seemingly simple assignment. It's an engaging story with plenty of Willeford's deadpan humor and enough action to propel the story forward at a fairly rapid clip. While not quite on a par with some of Willeford's better known books, it's still a fun read and will appeal especially to those who have read and enjoyed the author's other work.", "images": [], "asin": "1400032474", "parent_asin": "1400032474", "user_id": "AFR34VATA3I43FGP3RQVEBA6TO4A", "timestamp": 1428529943000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Laugh-tastic!", "text": "This book tries to teach manners (no idea if it's successful), and avoids being totally condescending and didactic by putting them all in the case of bizarre, childish make-believe scenarios. What do you say when you're walking backwards to town (because you like to do that) and bump into an alligator? What do you say when you're flying your plane and remember the Duchess asked you to drop in, so you do and break her roof?<br /><br />It's silliness incarnate, and you have to love it!<br /><br />There are three scenarios in particular that reviewers have commented on, so let's tackle those.<br /><br />The first is the \"decapitation\". In this case you're asked what you say when you're out picking flowers in front of your castle, a dragon appears and breathes smoke at you, and then a knight saves you by chopping off its head. (You say thank you.)<br /><br />There's no blood or anything gory shown, and as far as I'm concerned the princess being saved from the dragon by the knight is a common fairy tale set-up. I don't have a problem with this. There are more violent scenes in both classic and recent Disney animated films, nobody is claiming the dragon was talking and friendly and just violently attacked - I have no problem with this scene for this age group. Let's move on.<br /><br />The next one is where you are a cowboy. Suddenly the bad guy shows up and holds a gun to your head and asks \"Would you like me to shoot a hole in your head?\" (You say \"no thank you\", which strikes me as perfectly sensible.)<br /><br />This one is a bit trickier. I'll be honest and skip ahead a bit by saying I, personally have no problem with ANY of this book - but in this case I can really see why some people do. The scene is a bit explicit, and the Western is no longer a popular form of drama anyway so it's not like this situation is likely to have come up in your child's play.<br /><br />However, as nobody actually gets hurt, I'd say most kids won't even notice to be upset. There's more violent scenes on cartoons in the morning.<br /><br />And the last one that people have complained about is the one where you're a pirate and have captured a lady and tied her up. Every morning when you untie her to eat breakfast she says \"Good morning, how are you?\" and you are supposed to say the same.<br /><br />As far as this goes... meh. Clearly nobody is being particularly ill-treated.<br /><br />Now, overall, I don't mind any of these scenes because I know quite a few children. This sort of thing and more is exactly what they come up with when they're playing pretend. If you think children do not play-act violence you are very much mistaken. They do. They do it because it's exciting. They do it because it's fun to practice being really bad in a safe way that doesn't actually harm anyone, when in real life they work so hard to be GOOD. They do it because these things scare them and playing them makes them less scary. They do because the stories they are exposed to have violence there, explicit or implied, and they want to understand that. They do because you can't have a good story without a villain.<br /><br />And children have been doing this for as long as there have been children to play pretend at all. I do not believe that this is in any way linked to actual violence when these children grow up.<br /><br />Obviously if your child is bothered by this sort of pretend violence, don't read them this book. Or if you are. However, truthfully, I don't think it's that big a deal in this context.", "images": [], "asin": "0064431126", "parent_asin": "0064431126", "user_id": "AF3B7N46YKJFHVZJWAKKCUIDO6HQ", "timestamp": 1272772694000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The subjectivity that holds it back also makes it exceptional", "text": "It's hard to entirely explain Into Thin Air and why it works, especially since the very elements that make the book work as well as it does are also the ones that hold it back, in some ways. Into Thin Air is the story of what was, until recently, the deadliest day on Mount Everest. It's not an event that's easily summarized, nor one where there are clear lessons to learn; yes, there was a horrific storm, but there are countless other factors, from oxygen deprivation to overconfidence, from medical conditions to isolationist groups, from bad planning to human error. That makes for a sprawling story, and a shapeless one at times, and what it needs is someone able to take all of this information and process it coldly. Instead, we get Krakauer, a notable nonfiction author who was on Everest at the time of the expedition and, in ways both direct and indirect, contributed to some of the disaster. Krakauer's involvement means that Into Thin Air is never a cold or dispassionate work, and while Krakauer does a superb job of explaining the background and the context that's led to the commercialization of Everest (an aspect of the book which was fascinating to me), this is as much writing as catharsis or confession as it is storytelling. The result is a book that's a very subjective account of a nightmarish situation, with Krakauer trying as much to explain what happened to himself as to any audience. It's a fascinating book, largely because the very thing that makes the book so powerful and effective - Krakauer's involvement - is the same thing that keeps the book from attaining the focus or clarity that might make it better in some ways. And yet, I think the personal element is what makes Into Thin Air so gripping, as we experience both the confusion and chaos of the mountain as well as Krakauer's deep and inescapable guilt about the part he may have played in the disaster. It's a quietly haunting read, and while there may be better nonfiction looks at what happened, it's hard to imagine them being as painful as this is, or as memorable.", "images": [], "asin": "B000FC1ITK", "parent_asin": "B000FC1ITK", "user_id": "AESESBLLG3ZZISQONG5SOAEUGC3Q", "timestamp": 1434471525000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Sweet second chance romance/engagement story. A betrothed couple have a misunderstanding when H spots h hugging her longtime MALE best friend before said best friend heads off to the Peninsula to fight in the war. They have a confrontation, and H storms off and decides to join the fighting on the Peninsula, as well (it's not written as hotheaded as it sounds). He writes a letter to h that essentially gives her the okay to jilt him. Instead, she writes him back, and they thus begin a correspondence over the year. Story picks back up when it's Christmas Eve, and H returns to h's family's estate. I would say 3.5-ish, but the last line is definitely a 1-star hokey *cringe*-worthy mess. I know that sounds judgmental, but seriously, when these stories are so short, every paragraph counts.<br /><br />** \"The Viscount and the Hoyden\" by Laura Matthews - 2 stars. I read this story once, years ago. Came away with a bland and blah feeling that henceforth has made me skip this story every year when I bring this anthology out to reread around the holidays. Viscount's mother used to visit somewhere out in the country every year and would come back to tell him stories of this young hoydenish girl. He was enchanted by these tales and envious of her carefree upbringing (he was an only child, if I remember correctly). He visits the country estate with the idea of wooing her. Pretty meh overall. Definitely skippable, in my eyes.<br /><br />** \"The Christmas Mouse\" by Emily Hendrickson - 4 stars. I really really liked this one. It's a sweet story about a young woman who has unexpectedly inherited a country \"cottage.\" Only when she goes to the cottage, she sees it's actually an estate. With a manor house. And hundreds of acres of land. And tenant cottages. Oh, and a handsome estate manager by the name of Charles Dane. *wiggles eyebrows*<br /><br />Amanda, who had up til then been living with her brother and his wife as their unofficial (and unpaid) governess/nanny/tutor/poor relation, has always been retiring in her ways and quite shy around men, so she's quite pleased with the ease with which she can converse and keep company with Mr. Dane. Not only does this story present a sweet wallflower/beta romance, but it also is a bit of a coming of age story as Amanda learns to assert herself a bit and go after what she wants. The central conflict arises when Charlie realizes Amanda is quite an heiress, and he doesn't want her to think he's some kind of fortune hunter.<br /><br />** \"No Room at the Inn\" by Mary Balogh - 3.5 stars. A good story with a cast of characters that are stranded at an inn in a snow/ice/winter storm. A poor couple is also seeking shelter at the inn - in the stables, at that. She's pregnant, and the main action revolves around her going into labor.<br /><br />There are two couples whose romances are featured in this story: (1) an aristocratic married couple on their way to a house party and (2) a rakish marquess on his way to a debaucherous house party and a governess on her way to visit her family. The married couple has been unhappily married for three years, but each loves the other (if only they knew it). He thinks she doesn't need him and is happier with her ton friends than with his own company, while she has tried to be independent all this time because she hasn't wanted to be a burden on him, etc. She knows he keeps a mistress and doesn't understand why he brings his love to another; he keeps said mistress because he doesn't want to subject his wife to his base needs, etc. Basically, false assumptions have nudged them apart over the years until they just can't confront each other or put a finger on what exactly is wrong. I'm not explaining this well, but I really liked this couple. As you'd expect from Mary Balogh, she actually has a love scene in her short story between this couple...it's passionate and emotional. Very well done.<br /><br />What drags this story down is the second couple - the more traditional Regency-type relationship of a rake and a governess. I just found this couple flat out unbelievable. There's too much going on in the narrative for us to get any handle on either of their POVs for why they would fall in love with each other after being stranded together for two days. I think this story would have been much better served if it only focused on the married couple.", "images": [], "asin": "B001PDCXG0", "parent_asin": "B001PDCXG0", "user_id": "AGD3PVY57W5FHFD76WDZLNWNJFHQ", "timestamp": 1322770849000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Man Who Flies With Birds.", "text": "I am a Canada Geese fanatic, in fact, I wrote an article about them believing they should run the country! With this fascination, I went to my library to find more information about these magical creatures only to find there were no books on the subject (in my library). The Librarian kindly sent me to other books regarding birds and I found The Man Who Flies With Birds in the children's department. I thought it looked interesting and today, started to read it. I couldn't put it down - not since Harry Potter, another supposedly children's book, has anything grabbed my attention. Exquisite photography indeed and the written words were poetic in their scientific genre (don't you hate that word - just couldn't of another one). I was so entranced that I couldn't stop talking about it to my other half - every time I read a paragraph, I had something else to say. He is not a book reader - more of intelligent magazines and The Irish Times - so it was with some amazement that he agreed to take a look. HOOKED! I am ordering it now from Amazon - where else? - so I can have it in my possession before I return the copy I have to the library. I am not even into aviation, have a phobia about birds but am almost hypnotised by them. I was having a conversation some years ago with a man who was interested in retaining my services for a very prestigious conference when three Bald Eagles flew over the lake where we were discussing the event. For as long as the Eagles were there, I was transfixed. He talked - I didn't hear a word. This is exactly how I felt after the very first page of The Man Who Flies With Birds. Exciting, informative, unique and courageous. Not only that, this book and the work researched, saves lives. It is so topical with recent events of crashes due to birds flying into planes. I am always entranced with creativity and this is beyond the norm. Yossi Leshem is a genius. Whilst writing this, my 'to be' 9 year old grandson is to have his birthday in February so I believe I am to purchase two copies - he isn't getting mine. This is a forever in my library book. I am in my 80th year - obviously this book crosses the age perimetres. So, mind the gap and buy the book. I am going to recommend it to my family in the UK and Ireland. They have Amazon there too. Really, I just can't get over this book. Did I give you that impression? It's sensational - really. Would I lie to the great Amazon public.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Everything I want in an ice cream recipe", "text": "I took advantage of this book being on sale for such a great price after a friend recommended it. With flavors like Bangkok Peanut (peanut butter, coconut, cayenne...) and Roasted Strawberry, I was in. I really like that these recipes don't call for raw eggs like so many ice cream recipes do. Also, the author is very good about telling you where/how to find any unfamiliar ingredients. There is also a great amount of information given about the ingredients, suggestions for brands/sources, and what they contribute to each recipe.<br /><br />If I have to come up with one negative thing about it, it's that sometimes you have to do a bit of flipping around. For example, it'll say to add something, and see the technique for doing that on another recipe, instead of maybe putting it in the appendix with the other techniques. Other than that, I am truly satisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />I'd like to point out that most of the negative reviews seem to be from people who failed to actually READ the book. Yes, most of the recipes call for corn syrup - and the author specifically says that this does NOT mean High Fructose Corn Syrup. If you have a corn allergy or whatever, she also says that tapioca syrup works too, and you can order that on Amazon or find it in Whole Foods. Also, YES, many of these recipes are non-traditional. If you order the book from Amazon and fail to take the opportunity to look at the index, it's not the book's fault that you don't like the recipes in it. There are the traditional chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, etc., but if that's all you want, why are you buying a cookbook?<br /><br />I'm really hoping I can make it out to Columbus to visit one of her shops!", "images": [], "asin": "1579654363", "parent_asin": "1579654363", "user_id": "AGKECFNC2TOWXKYWNYQAPMN7RKQQ", "timestamp": 1329100718000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Story is pretty basic but illustrations are delightful.", "text": "Nothing new or ground-breaking here, just a sweet little story about a shy little squirrel making new friends by attending a party. There are parts which may strike you as a bit clunky and odd-sounding, and I suspect that this might have flowed a bit more smoothly in the original French. For example:<br /><br /> &#34;..Ant asked the seagull what the vast emptiness of sea and sky was like (Because it's so mysterious...this emptiness!)&#34; Your preschooler won't be the only one puzzled by phrases like that.<br /><br />In addition, much is made of the mysterious 'nothing tart'  which will be served at the party. Ant asks Harry the bear will there be a tart? What sort? Harry says it will be a 'nothing tart'. Next page: ant's mouth waters just thinking about the 'mysterious' nothing tart. Next page: Harry is &#34;still thinking about the nothing tart&#34;. He tells George the owl that &#34;the evening would be absolutely unforgettable because of the wonderful nothing tart.&#34; Next page: George wonders what sort of costume goes with a nothing tart. Several pages later, at the party, ant is speaking &#34;between bites of nothing tart.&#34; That's it. Never mentioned again. Was that supposed to be funny? I don't get it.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the illustrations, very brightly colored and done in a retro early-1960s style. An extra star just for those.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Absolutely soulful!", "text": "What a soulful book.  I laughed.  I cried.  And I learned some philosophy from a dog.  Yes, a dog.<br /><br />I have to admit, when I realized that the main character in the book was Enzo the dog, and that it all takes place from his point of view, I wondered if the story would really maintain my interest.  I needn\u2019t have worried.  It did!<br /><br />Enzo is a philosopher with a worldview shaped by lots of TV, movies about car racing and the love and protection of his owner, Denny.  (The love and protection is definitely reciprocated!)  Enzo is both na\u00efve and wise and hoping in his next life to be a human with the ability to speak and to use opposable thumbs.  After living inside Enzo\u2019s head, I think he\u2019s ready.  I think he should graduate.  He\u2019d be a human I\u2019d like to know.<br /><br />There were so many quotable quotes in this book, so many bits of philosophy that I just loved.  Here\u2019s one of my favorites:<br /><br />\u201cBut my thoughts turned to what [Denny] had just taught me.  Such a simple concept, yet so true:  that which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our destiny.  Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.\u201d<br /><br />I\u2019m torn with whether to call this book a pleasant read.  I somehow don\u2019t think \u201cpleasant\u201d applies as there are some really tough times that Denny and Enzo go through.

I can see the hurt from his past, and yes his snarky comments made me laugh half of the time, but the other half they just annoyed me.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Life After Life", "text": "Hey, wait a minute, didn't I just review this? No, but I came upon it when reviewing another book of the same title by Aminatta Forna. And my review title is borrowed from two other novels that have also recently appeared (by Kate Atkinson and Jill McCorkle). Both titles are eminently suited to Linda Olsson's new novel, though it is smaller in scale and less ambitious in theme than any of the others.<br /><br />I have greatly enjoyed Olsson's previous novels, [[ASIN:0143038079 ASTRID AND VERONIKA]] and [[ASIN:0143114700 SONATA FOR MIRIAM]], for the quiet interiority of her writing. I have also admired her ability to use the sparse landscapes of Sweden or New Zealand as a foil for the emotional lives of her mostly female characters. Both countries play a part here. The actual setting is the thinly-populated New Zealand coast southwest of Auckland on the North Island, where Marion Flint, a woman in early middle age, semi-retired physician and part-time artist, has fled to handle some nameless grief alone; there are hints of a deceased husband or lover. But most of the memories that return to her in italicized flashbacks of increasing frequency are of her childhood, first on an idyllic island between Sweden and Finland, and later in Stockholm and London. It is clear that Marion is an emotionally damaged woman, though it will be a long time before we discover exactly how the various phases of her life connect up.<br /><br />The catalyst is a small boy called Ika, who begins drifting into her life, visiting most Thursdays. He appears to be somewhat autistic and uncommunicative, but he has real gifts for art and for music. [Music plays a significant part here as in Olsson's other books, Bill Evans' \"Peace Piece\" especially setting the tone for the latter part of the novel.] The book has a slow beginning, but then something happens that accelerates both Marion's present-day actions and the flood of her memories. She finds herself having to reach out to her neighbors, take actions that might have legal consequences, and come to terms with what Ika means in her life.<br /><br />The book is very much about second, third, and even fourth chances, starting another life after the previous one had effectively ended. We will learn about traumas that effectively tore Marion's childhood life into three separate fragments, and we will see them echoed in the painful fissures that ripped apart her adult one. My only complaint about the novel is that these reflections are just too obviously planned. You notice this at first in a too-close parallel between casual events in the present and the memories that they trigger. Later, the story comes to depend on one huge coincidence and a number of minor ones that would be enough to make some readers I know throw the book at the wall in disgust. But not me. For I know Olsson to be a musician, and if she wants to compose a novel as one might a sonata, with themes and variations and recapitulation, then I am willing to accept the artifice. Besides, I had come to care for the people, and ended the book with tears in my eyes. Tears of contentment. Tears of homecoming.", "images": [], "asin": "0143122436", "parent_asin": "0143122436", "user_id": "AGCWDKIATRJJB7QSRKWICHCKWQHQ", "timestamp": 1364754424000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "An Almost Excellent Boston Guide!", "text": "The Frommers's Guide to Boston and it's surrounding area is quite useful, informational, and ideal for those coming to Boston for the first time or hundredth time. Boston is very historic, enlightening, and a worldly city. The book is done well but it can be done better for those of us who would like to know Boston and it's neighborhood.<br /><br />Boston has attracted all kinds of people like Julia Child who is missing from the text. She was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I wished that she was written more about here. She remained in Cambridge for decades even with the success of her shows and books. Cambridge has also attracted actor John Malkovich as well in recent years as well as other famous and notable residents. In Julia's book, she decided with her husband to settle in Cambridge after they returned from Europe. I wished the book would have acknowledged Julia Child's contributions to American cuisine, television history, and American culture.<br /><br />I also wished the book mentioned Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts as well but it doesn't. There are lot of important facts and information about Boston that isn't here. I loved the film section about what films in recent years especially \"The Fighter\" in Lowell and other notable films.<br /><br />I liked the book's acknowledgement of cemeteries where famous Americans such as Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and others have been interred.

He neglects the fact that in the long run, taxes of that level would surely lower investments in human capital and the creation of new businesses. And, He fails to recognize one crucial implication of his own argument about the power of non-diminishing capital returns: if capital is so mobile and dynamic that it can avoid diminishing returns, as Piketty claims, then it will probably also avoid being taxed, which means that the search for tax revenue will have to shift elsewhere, and governments will find that soaking the rich does not really work.", "images": [], "asin": "067443000X", "parent_asin": "067443000X", "user_id": "AFY4RK3KVSMBU4WVHCWZJ7ZHF2DQ", "timestamp": 1398484169000, "helpful_vote": 74, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "This one pays beautiful homage to the Alice Network.", "text": "What I Didn\u2019t Like:<br />-Charlie\u2019s chapters. They felt almost repetitive and unnecessarily fluffy. I suppose they exist mostly to break up the heaviness of the topics addressed in the rest of the book, which is important, but they just don\u2019t give the same sense of urgency and excitement as Eve\u2019s chapters.<br />-The math \u201cequations\u201d forced on everything. As an actual math geek myself, I can say it\u2019s incredibly unlikely you\u2019ll find us making statements like \u201cme plus him minus morals equals \u2026\u201d. We tend to feel operations have weight and value, meaning we\u2019re less likely to throw them around in ways they weren\u2019t intended for. But maybe that\u2019s just me. Either way, it annoyed me that Charlie kept doing this.<br />-The ending. If you\u2019ve been following my reviews for a while you know I\u2019m the kind of reader who likes endings that don\u2019t lay it all out for me and instead keep me thinking and guessing long after I finish the book. I realize I\u2019m in the minority there. That being said, this final chapter (epilogue) felt unnecessary to me.<br /><br />What I Did Like:<br />-The historical research involved in this one added a wonderful sense of accuracy that this tale needed. The Alice network was real. Many of the women mentioned are based on real people and their real stories. This was an excellent retelling of their challenge, specifically Eve\u2019s chapters. This is 100% of the reason this book is recommended by so many people and passed around so frequently. It\u2019s an important part of history well researched and embedded.<br />-High tension. Eve\u2019s chapters ran with an intense sense of urgency that kept my interest and kept the story moving. I felt myself pulled to continue reading just to find out what happened next. She was captivating and compelling right from the first scene she popped into.<br />-The romance side storyline worked. I don\u2019t always say that and I definitely don\u2019t think it was entirely necessary (not every story needs a romance) but this one works. It\u2019s believable and it works for this story.<br /><br />Who Should Read This One:<br />-Historical fiction fans, specifically those who want something different from WWI or WWII fiction that already exists. This emphasis on the Alice Network makes this one refreshingly different from the rest of the offerings out there.<br /><br />My Rating: 4 Stars<br />Solidly researched historical fiction makes me happy.", "images": [], "asin": "B01LZFL63S", "parent_asin": "B01LZFL63S", "user_id": "AG662FMJFCYUSYQUBY4ZBYXHVBZQ", "timestamp": 1658782215535, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great book", "text": "Note: this is a new adult book and it deals with mature themes such as rape, and explicit sex.<br /><br />Going Under is beautifully written. I was really moved by the writing in this book. S. Walden did an amazing job evoking emotion with her writing. Brooke is such a strong young lady. Even though some of the things she did were pretty dangerous and I wouldn't recommend her course of action, I completely understand why she felt like she needed to. I can't even imagine losing my best friend the way she lost hers. This book is about her journey really. Sure, there is also the \"secret club of jerks\" storyline that she is trying to get to the bottom to, but for me it was much more about justice for Beth and closure for Brooke.<br /><br />Brooke is completely weighed down by her guilt for most of the book. She feels responsible for her best friends death because of certain things that happened before her death. But no one else blames Brooke. She only blames herself. And because of this guilt she hatches a plan to avenge Beth. And she spends most of the book figuring out a way to do it. Along the way, she meets Ryan and they seemed like magnets. They were instantly drawn to each other. Even though they both tried to keep their distance, they just couldn't stay away for long. But Ryan and Brooke each had their own secrets. (just like everyone else at the school, it seemed). There were a few twists and turns and theories thrown around at various points in the story but I thought it was pretty clear what was really going on. There wasn't too much mystery surrounding the secret club, but I still loved the way the story flowed.<br /><br />Nothing felt forced, or rushed. The writing was descriptive and beautiful really. Going Under is a very powerful book. The strength that you see in Brooke is beautiful. She is someone that you are rooting for the whole time. I just loved her. Going under deals with some pretty mature and dark themes and there is some graphic scenes but it is just a great book.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A cynical classic", "text": "The Battle of Britain. Dashing, fearless young patriots out of Shakespeare take to their machines to save Albion from Nazi bombers. Battling hopeless odds and a vastly superior enemy, these lions of the sky prevail against evil, save democracy, and land back at base in time for their tea.<br /><br />Or not.<br /><br />Derek Robinson's \"Piece of Cake\" has to be one of the most brutally cynical, myth-debunking pieces of historical fiction ever put to pen. In its 650+ pages it methodically, and at times gleefully, ravages the heroic sterotype of Britain's fighter pilots cemented by the hundreds of books, movies, and documentaries which have come out since the war. In the language of the book, it puts paid to all that bumf and tells the truth --or rather, Robinson's version of it.<br /><br />\"Cake\" is the story of Hornet Squadron, a rather average collection of fighter pilots flying Hurricanes, between September 1939 and September 1940. It details their involvement in the \"phoney war,\" the Battle of France and lastly, the Battle of Britain. From the very first chapter, when a number of the pilots wreck their car while driving home drunk from a pub, then steal a tractor, and finally horses, to get back to their base, the reader begins to realize that we few, we happy few, we band of brothers, is nowhere to be found here. With the occasional exception, Hornet Squadron is a collection of snobbish, selfish, sophomoric, not-too-terribly bright adrenaline junkies who joined the RAF in the hopes of blowing things up without legal consequences. It's a case of be careful what you wish for, times two.<br /><br />For a story with so many characters -- the squadron has more than a dozen, and chaps are always getting knocked off and replaced -- Robinson does a terrific job of keeping them all fresh and distinct from each other. Each reader will have his own favorite \"good\" guy -- goodhearted flight leader Fanny Barton, the cold-blooded American volunteer Christopher Hart (\"CH3\"), the crazy as a loon Flash Gordon, or possibly the non-fighting duo of \"Uncle\" Kellaway (the squadron adj) and his sidekick, an Oxford don turned intelligence officer \"Skull\" Skellen, who spend a lot of time arguing about squirrels. There is no question about the squadron's biggest bastard -- not since \"GoodFellas\" Joe Pesci/Tommy DeVito did I hate somebody as much as Lance \"Moggy\" Cattermole, the big, smooth-talking sociopath who seems to enjoy tormenting and using his squadron mates even more than he likes to machine-gun German pilots as they hang helpless in their parachutes. Robinson takes positive delight in showing how how Hart's theory that \"up there the world is divided into bastards and suckers\" also applies on terra firma.<br /><br />\"Piece of Cake\" was a contraversial book not only for its thoroughly unglamorous depiction of the RAF jocks but because it expands on the touchy and undiscussed issue of the RAF's kill claims. The pilots, who in fairness can hardly be blamed for making mistakes given the nature of air combat prior to the installation of the gun camera, claimed about 2.5 German aircraft destroyed for every one that actually was. The vastly overstated statistics issued by the RAF made their way into the postwar literature and contributed to the mythos surrounding the battle. In point of fact, the Germans had about 900 fighters to the Brits 600, and the Me 109 was badly hampered by its extremely short range and the necessity to try and protect the bombers. The odds were somewhat closer than the Brits care to believe.<br /><br />\"Piece of Cake\" wasn't written to disparage the courage of the British pilots or denigrate their accomplishments, but to show them for what they were -- young, often immature officer-boys of varying character who sometimes died stupid and futile deaths. In other words, human beings at war. In this sense, Robinson does the RAF a favor, for heroism is much more impressive when it comes from real people rather than Hollywood cartoons. After all, peacetime flaws often make for wartime virtues. Or as Hart says to Fanny Barton about Moggy: \"He really does like killing people. You don't know how lucky you are to have him.\"", "images": [], "asin": "030436312X", "parent_asin": "030436312X", "user_id": "AGVZFZTN4MW2CXG7R34S6N3NTB6A", "timestamp": 1115127709000, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "One of my favorite reads this year", "text": "4.5 stars<br />I thought this book was a breath of fresh air as it's not the type of story I necessarily get to read very often. In some ways it is such a simple story but because the characters are complex as is their relationship, it just somehow works in an absolutely beautiful way.  I'm left feeling like this was just one of those good, rewarding reading experiences that only happens every once in awhile.<br /><br />Connell is smart, popular, and a football star at his high school.  Marianne is also smart but doesn't have any friends at school and gets picked on for her appearance as well as being labeled a mental case. Connell's mother cleans houses for a living and Marianne's family is one of her clients.  Connell often picks his mom up from work and that is how he gets to know Marianne better and develop an interesting connection to her.  But he definitely doesn't want the kids at school to know he has feelings for the outcast so he doesn't acknowledge Marianne at school or any other time except when they are alone.  And Marianne is okay with this.  The story alternates between the perspectives of Connell and Marianne and follows them over the course of a few years.<br /><br />Fair warning, Sally Rooney does not use quotation marks in her writing so if you think that might bother you when reading dialogue, maybe give this book a pass.  Personally, even though I don't see this writing technique used very often, it doesn't take me very long to adjust and get used to it.<br /><br />I read the author's other book, Conversations with Friends, a few years ago and enjoyed it but I liked this one even more.  Part of that can be due to the fact the characters in this book were far more likable, especially Marianne.  She is somebody who you wanted to be happy and you hurt when she hurt.  There is just something about these characters and their relationship that just spoke to me.  I really can't put it into words.<br /><br />I do recommend checking this one out but I will freely admit it's the type of book that you will either think is special or you will be left wondering why was there was so much hype.  As readers we bring our life experiences into every book we read so it makes sense we might not all gravitate towards the same stories. I personally loved this one though and am thankful I read it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "From a Gliderman's Viewpoint", "text": "There are not many \"first-hand accounts\" of the glider troopers in World War II but Fighting With The Screaming Eagles goes a long way to fill that void.<br /><br />Robert Bowen has as easy, natural style, which brings to light many of the unique challenges facing the glider forces.  First, they were not volunteers but were expected to perform at the same high combat level as paratroopers.  And that they did!<br /><br />Second, they were delivered into combat in light, vulnerable, plywood gliders in a controlled crash landing that was considerably more dangerous than a parachute jump.  They didn't receive their special insignia and hazardous duty pay until July 1944.<br /><br />Bowen pulls no punches as he takes the reader through the rough training, the Atlantic crossing and how the 401st stubbornly clung to its unit identity after being assigned as the 1st Battalion of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment (GIR) of the 101st Airborne Division.  From there, his unit was in reserve to the 4th Infantry Division coming ashore on Utah Beach and the harrowing glider landings in Operation Market-Garden before being rushed to the Ardennes on the battle of the Bulge where Bowen was captured.<br /><br />His unique perspective as both a glider warrior and a POW make this book extremely interesting and informative.  Pictures, maps, a robust bibliography and a Roll of Honor for Company C, 401st round out this extraordinary book.<br /><br />Anyone interested in airborne operations in Word War II will love this book.<br /><br />John E.

The Redwall elders are unusually harsh, particularly in the beginning of the book.  Their characters seem very flat, and any changes in their actions don't seem believable.  While I can accept the most overly-convenient events in a story I'm already suspending disbelief for, the badgers Salixa and Tabura came out of nowhere to fix Gorath's Bloodwrath.  Salixa in particular was ridiculously two-dimensional.  She was described as &#34;slender&#34; and &#34;gentle&#34; far too often to not be repetitive.

Now a crisis concerning Julian's young son - her adored stepchild had brought Liane back into his life.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Slow start but a good coming-of-age tale", "text": "Initially, I found The Wish Maker a difficult book to follow.  The beginning has a tendency to meander and ramble a bit so I found it hard at times to follow the narrative thread.  It took me a while to understand that the first chapter takes place in the present while subsequent chapters take place in the past.  My major quibble about the book would be with the timeline because it is hard to tell at times whether the events described take place in the present or past.<br /><br />Once I got past my confusion, though, I found the book to be an interesting coming-of-age tale.  It centers mostly around Zaki and Samar, who are cousins but are brought up almost like siblings.  Much of the book describes their childhood and it's a childhood that isn't all that different from an American childhood.  However, it is set against a background of some major historical events in Pakistan.  It's interesting how these events are treated almost casually but it also makes sense that they would be treated thus.  The characters, like most of us, are concerned with their day-to-day events and so, even though these historical events are important to them, they sometimes take a backseat to the characters' more immediate concerns.<br /><br />Another aspect of the novel that I found interesting were the ways in which Western culture has influenced Pakistan in the past and continues to influence it today.  I found a scene in a Pizza Hut to be particularly vivid and it makes for a nice reminder of how taking one small piece of a culture can lead to a somewhat warped view of the whole.<br /><br />Sethi has a nice voice and spins a good yarn.  However, I think he could benefit from some brevity and a bit more clarity.  I had a hard time getting through the first part of the book and even put it aside for a while and read a couple of books in between.  I'm glad that I persisted with it but had the narrative been tighter right from the beginning, I would probably have enjoyed the novel more.  The risk is that not every reader will persist and I think that would be a shame because I ultimately found this to be a good story about the impact of family relationships and how they shape individuals.", "images": [], "asin": "1594488754", "parent_asin": "1594488754", "user_id": "AEHGCBDKAVKSK5UW6PJQL6JJWG7A", "timestamp": 1245290694000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great history along with great, realistic characters", "text": "At first I was a little disappointed in this book, because I was expecting a book more along the lines of Khaled Hosseini's &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34;  Something poetic that highlighted the everyday in the average Chechen's life...  Instead, this book is more about violence that took place during the Russian's occupation of Chechnya, and how it played out on the ground for some ordinary villagers, as well as a Russian female doctor.  But after I finished the book, and started thinking on the story more, I had(have) to admit it's really rather a good book.  Really brings to life all of the main characters (i.e. Sonja, the doctor, Havaa, a villager who loses her family, and Akhmed, the man who saves her by bringing her to Sonja).  I am more of a political person, and so have read all about the violence perpetrated on the Chechen population by the Russians, and the various &#34;holy war&#34; battles by the Chechens in response.  So I think I was accepting more stories along those lines.  Instead, the main character, Sonja, is Russian, and prior to this book I knew very little about Russians who had been &#34;resettled&#34; in Chechnya.  So learning more about that community was fascinating.  In addition, I had known very little about the &#34;disappearances&#34; of ordinary Chechens in an effort to get them to report on their neighbors (rather like the disappearances of large populations in various Latin American countries), so that was quite interesting too.  The author's rendering of Sonja is brilliant (i.e. how daily violence affects those buried under it, even if the violence does not happen to them directly).

After a particularly humiliating episode in which she is reprimanded (instead of adored as usual) by her teacher, she is magically transported to a strange land full of strange beings. It is pretty plain that she is not in Kansas (in this case, New York) any more. Altana makes a friend who introduces her to her family and the foreign customs of the land, which is called Ilmarinen.  There are magical plants and talking centaurs.  Healing (or the practice of  medicine) is forbidden. Young readers will follow with excitement as Altana encounters one dangerous situation after another. Just before disaster strikes, Altana awakes in her home world, where no one believes a word about her fantastical journeys. The years pass, and we see Altana go on to middle school and high school.  Her mundane world is marked by the customary rites of passage.  Middle schoolers bully her,  and she feels the sting of personal betrayal. At crucial times, Altana either escapes (or is she summoned?) back to Ilmarinen, where she is destined to fulfill a prophecy which will free the inhabitants from a ruling despot.  Before I finished it, my one reservation about recommending this story for youg readers was that it seemed  that Altana had not even a modicum of modesty. Alas, I judged too soon!

These are hands down the most beautiful and artistic versions of the Harry Potter book series. The quality is exceptional. I have three copies of the series (my old books from initial release, the complete red hardback copies with Hungarian horntail box, and now starting to collect these) and can confirm that these are truly the most elite version to date.<br /><br />Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima (MinaLima masterminds) created the graphic designs behind all the famous graphic elements of Harry Potter as seen in films. They created the famous letter from Hogwarts, the Marauders Map, Daily Prophet, the howler, the black family wallpaper, the wanted posters and so much more. I have grown up reading the books, watching the films and am beyond obsessed with the Wizard World. These books are so ornate and astonishing to someone who has reread the series multiple times, that it feels like I am reading the novels as a child for the first time. The book has several popup elements, beautiful color images, and more that make it such an interactive reading experience.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "World's longest running 'Best of' horror anthology!", "text": "'Best New Horror' is now the longest running annual 'best of' horror anthology ever, beating the previous 22-volume record held for the past eighteen years by DAW Books for 'The Year's Best Horror Stories' (1971-1994). Although, in fairness to the industrious Ellen Datlow, she has - so far - edited an unbroken run of 25 annual 'best of' anthologies, twenty-one with St. Martin's Press and currently four with Night Shade Books. Of course, both have a ways to go yet to beat the mighty Gardner Dozois, who has edited a colossal 34 'best of' science fiction volumes since 1977, five with the publisher Dutton and, presently, twenty-nine editions of 'The Year's Best Science Fiction'.<br /><br />Last year 'Best New Horror' and Datlow's 'The Best Horror of the Year' overlapped by quite a few stories: this year none overlap. In fact, together with Paula Guran's 'The Year's Best Dark Fantasy & Horror', only one story is duplicated out of a total of 77, making this year a true embarrassment of riches.<br /><br />RAMSEY CAMPBELL leads off with \"Holding the Light\". Curiosity, a burning need to just know: the curse of youth, as young Tom and Lucas find out when they go exploring a local tunnel said to be haunted. As ever, Campbell's language is deceptively simple, the accumulative effect eerie, one of dread.<br /><br />Next up CHRISTOPHER FOWLER gives us a mischievous piece of whimsy, presented as the monologue of a patron of The Jack O'Lantern pub telling a new customer about the strange events that always seem to occur there throughout its history on All-Hallows Eve. Readers of Fowler's recent Hammer-homage horror novel 'Hell Train' will know just how delightfully sly he can be, and as with the best of tongue-in-cheek horror \"Lantern Jack\" still manages to give a nasty bite at the end.<br /><br />\"Rag and Bone\" by PAUL KANE is classic Best New Horror. I heard once that, with the overwhelming number of stories he has to consider each year, editor Jones will often read the first few pages then skip to the last few: if the story ends up going in the direction he thought it was then what's the point? After many decades in the business he wants to be surprised. So no surprise, then, he picked Kane as this story of a scrap merchant - a rag and bone man - doesn't finish up where you think it will.<br /><br />\"Some Kind of Light Shines from Your Face\" by GEMMA FILES is from the World Fantasy and British Fantasy Society Award-nominated 'Gutshot', an anthology of weird western stories edited by Conrad Williams. Western it certainly is, but it also involves Greek legends: a young woman joins two women in a travelling wagon, crossing the American dustbowl and scraping up a living by setting up tent and displaying their wares to grubby patrons eager to spend the little coin they have on catching a glimpse of the fair flesh and secret parts of comely women; to look on something fine to take their minds off their dry, barren existence. The women wear masks on stage, and when young Persia Leitner is eventually allowed to join them as well, a trinity is formed, and something happens... and old myths become new reality.<br /><br />\"Midnight Flight\" by JOEL LANE is, as the author himself says in the introduction, \"a story about the loss of memory, and how memory might not want to be lost.\" Concerning a man slowly recalling the title and details of a lost book from his childhood, whilst losing the identity of who he is now, the language very much recalls classic Ramsey Campbell in the author's claustrophobic depiction of misinterpretation and paranoia - and even manages to out-do Campbell in the closing page!<br /><br />\"But None Shall Sing for Me\" by GREGORY NICOLL is a piece of exotic horror set in the Caribbean and told from the point of view of a zombie. No, this isn't the knock about fun of Tim Powers' terrific `On Stranger Tides' novel, but an intense tale of closure and setting oneself free.<br /><br />Some of the best horror is the simplest, as demonstrated by ALISON LITTLEWOOD in \"About the Dark\". Three youths, Adam, Fuzz and Sasha, enter what is locally known as the Dark Cave. Through Sasha, we learn that there is a darkness in the cave, and not simply an absence of light. Many people have gone into the cave. Some never came back, their names written on the walls. Adam has recently started attending a new school, where he has reinvented himself from the bullied to a strong and disinterested figure who doesn't care about anything. Except he does. He cares about Sasha, but because of the newly created image of himself he doesn't show it and she goes with Fuzz instead, which annoys him greatly. Only once do all three enter the dark; thereafter Adam ventures alone and learns about the dark... and the names... and who puts them there. Understated, exact, and with an atmosphere that closes in on you. A frequent contributor to the UK's premiere horror fiction magazine, `Black Static' (wherein this story was first published; another story she had in the same magazine last year was reprinted by Ellen Datlow), Littlewood recently hit the UK bestseller lists with the publication of her well-received debut novel `A Cold Season'.<br /><br />In \"The Photographer's Tale\" by DANIEL MILLS Lowell's estranged apprentice, Patrick, sends him a camera. It's 1892 and this camera is the very latest model. It is also unique, as Lowell soon finds out. When looking through the lens it reveals not only what the subject will eventually look like in old age, but what secrets lie beneath their mask of make-up and outward personality. And once Lowell sees the truth, he sees it everywhere... even when no longer looking through the lens.<br /><br />\"The Tower\" by MARK SAMUELS comes from his collection `The Man Who Collected Machen and Other Weird Tales'. In this deceptively simple story a man, disillusioned with the modern commercial world and the vapidity of its future he envisions ahead, begins seeing a fog-enshrouded tower, where there shouldn't be any, in the middle of the city of London. A symbolism, he believes, for where he's trying to go, what he has to become. The power of this tale lies in the telling, and is on a par with the measured surrealism of Thomas Ligotti. Both write fresh horror, but imbued with the disciplined style of old masters like M.R. James, Robert Aickman, Algernon Blackwood and, of course, Arthur Machen. This is his seventh appearance in `Best New Horror' since volume 15.<br /><br />Last year's \"Christmas with the Dead\" by Joe R. Lansdale was Best New Horror's knock-about story; this year PETER ATKINS picks up that mantel in the delightful and snappily written \"Dancing Like we're Dumb\". It sees the return of his detective character, Kitty Donnelly, in a short, breezy tale of gangsters dabbling in the supernatural. It starts off with Kitty being carjacked and kidnapped: her day just gets worse from there on out!<br /><br />\"An Indelible Stain Upon the Sky\" by SIMON STRANTZAS is an emotionally complex story, allegorical, symbolic and thick with meaning and portent: Port McCarthy, once beautiful, is a damaged town, wrecked by an oil tanker spill. Our narrator and his wife Suzanne, once filled with hope and love, now stained like the town. Both fates - the town's and the couple's - are intricately entwined. Returning alone ten years after the town's accident to the inn they first stayed in, and the beginning of his wife's own descent, the narrator reflects on the crumbling of the past, seeing stains and shadows in the room and how his way of thinking, and what he said, came to infect his wife. The rich symbolism of the closing passages have a deep, ironic weight. This is horror of raw feelings, the writing delicately balanced, and being a tale of non-explicit horror it would not have looked out of place in this year's `The Best American Short Stories'.<br /><br />\"Hair\" by JOAN AIKEN comes from her posthumously published collection. Brief, but sharp, it tells of Tom keeping a promise to his recently deceased young wife to deliver a lock of her hair to her mother, whom he has never actually met before, his wife having been estranged from her for some time. An old woman, and very strange, Tom soon wishes he had still never met her.<br /><br />Echoes of Ramsey Campbell's influence can also be heard in the tight, dread-filled language of STEVE RASNIC TEM's \"Miri\", which marks his 16th appearance in Best New Horror. Here Rick finds his new life invaded by memories of a damaged and needy girl from his college days. Memories so tangible as to blur and make indistinct the reality he's currently trying to live in.<br /><br />\"Corbeaux Bay\" by GEETA ROOPNARINE is a short but effective story of a man who likes to get away from it all by exploring his local beach, where birds to whom he was cruel and dismissive in the past, now take a keen interest in him.<br /><br />\"Sad, Dark Thing\" by MICHAEL MARSHALL SMITH is from what was easily last year's best original horror anthology, ` A Book of Horrors' edited by Stephen Jones, which I've reviewed and where readers can find my thoughts on this story. As I said of a Smith story in a review of another Jones anthology from last year, `Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', everything Smith touches at short story length these days turns to gold.  As for this present story, suffice it to say here that it was also reprinted in `The Best British Short Stories 2012', a non-genre literary anthology.<br /><br />ROBERT SILVERBERG is easily the longest serving writer here: his first short story sale was in 1954 when he was eighteen-years-old - almost 60 years ago. Silverberg is a solid novelist, but a dazzling short story writer, as witness the recent massive retrospective from Subterranean Press, `Phases of the Moon: Stories from Six Decades' (2004), and as too witness this present story, \"Smithers and the Ghosts of the Thar\", published in what is now the author's seventh decade as a professional writer. Although Silverberg is indelibly associated with the science fiction genre, Jones has had occasion over the years to reprint his short stories in some of his themed anthologies, but this marks his first appearance in Best New Horror - and it's a welcome inclusion.<br /><br />Old masters such as M.R. James and Robert Aickman are talked of with reverence these days. Will REGGIE OLIVER one day be talked of that way? No, he already is. Oliver's contribution, \"Guieta Non Movere\", is actually lifted from his novella \"The Giacometti Crucifixion\" where it served as a story-within-a-story. That's how good Oliver is, when 'half' a story is so rich in language and storytelling that it can stand on its own.<br /><br />\"The Crawling Sky\" by JOE R. LANSDALE sees the return of the Reverend Jedidiah Mercer, who first appeared in the author's cult weird wild west novel 'Dead in the West' (1986), and in recent years in a series of short stories, one of which, \"Deadman's Road\", was included in Best New Horror 19. Lansdale has a voice soaked in the dialect of his East Texas home and his dialogue crackles with sun-lazy barbs and quips, his beloved landscape conjured with a few deft strokes of description. Here the Reverend finds himself in a spit of a little town called Wood Tick where, with shunned local Norville, he goes out to a ramshackle homestead to banish a 'haint' that is not of this world - and his doesn't do so with prayer and holy water!<br /><br />Together with Simon Strantzas, SIMON KURT UNSWORTH has clearly become a firm favourite of editor Stephen Jones, both having appeared four times now in the  past five volumes of Best New Horror. Here he gives us \"The Ocean Grand, North West Coast\" from his linked-collection of haunted dwellings, `Quiet Houses'. Mandeville, Parry and Yeoman form a restoration crew, and the Ocean Grand is their biggest project yet. Built at the turn of the last century and slowly neglected by a procession of changing owners over the decades, it has now lain derelict for 15 years. An ambitious design, a marriage of function and art, the concept of the hotel was to show the industrial design on the ground floor gradually changing into that of nature on the third floor. As the author himself says, \"[it's] about art created to be viewed, being alone, and going slowly claustrophobically mad.\"<br /><br />The multi-award winning EVANGELINE WALTON may have died in 1996, but here Jones presents us with \"They That Have Wings\", a 'lost' story of World War II in the great tradition of `Weird Tales' magazine.<br /><br />\"White Roses, Bloody Silk\" by rising star THANA NIVEAU is quite different from her contribution of last, \"The Pier\". This Victorian era tale of terror may start out slight and whimsical - but don't be fooled: a dinner party and a strange guest soon turns thorny. And bloody.<br /><br />\"Passing Through Peacehaven\" is RAMSEY CAMPBELL's second story in this year's volume (he is the only author to be twice given the honour of having two short stories reprinted within a given volume of Best New Horror). Next to Silverberg, Campbell is the second longest serving author in this current edition of Best New Horror, his first sale being in 1962 (indeed, he was only sixteen-years-old; even younger than Silverberg!). He is, without doubt, a giant of the horror field and this year marks his 50th anniversary as a writer. Finally, Best New Horror 23 ends with \"Holiday Home\" by DAVID BUCHAN, a piece of crime flash fiction.<br /><br />There are other fine stories, \"Wait\" by CONRAD WILLIAMS, which I reviewed last year under its original publication in 'Haunts: Reliquaries of the Dead', one of the best ghost anthologies in years. Prolific novelist and short story writer TIM LEBBON give us a \"Trick of the Light\", a sensitively handled tale from the extremely good and recommended 'House of Fear' edited by Jonathan Oliver (Datlow and Guran also picked stories from this anthology). Plus the author of the bestselling 'Let the Right One In' JOHN AJVIDE LINDQVIST's first short story, my review of which can be found under 'A Book of Horrors'. Six of that anthology's stories have now been reprinted, Ellen Datlow gave special citation to a further two stories in the opening paragraph of her Summation in 'The Best Horror of the Year: Volume Four', one other story has recently won an award and yet another story has been nominated for an award - making that 10 stories that have been 'named checked'; a quite remarkable achievement considering the anthology only contains fourteen stories in total.<br /><br />[This review comes from an advance copy bought at the FantasyCon, Brighton book launch on September 29th.]<br /><br />Also released today is 'The Mammoth Book of Ghost Stories by Women' edited by Marie 0'Regan - well worth checking out!", "images": [], "asin": "0762445971", "parent_asin": "0762445971", "user_id": "AE4VY5DUIIVFL2KJE2UDCXQ7RXXQ", "timestamp": 1350550403000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A useful, but flawed book.", "text": "The title of this mathematics textbook indicates its intended audience:  \"Management, Life and Social Sciences\".  If this is indeed its goal, then the book suffers from a serious flaw, namely, the authors have forgotten that individuals studying \"Management, Life and Social Sciences\" come from a wide variety of backgrounds -- backgrounds which may or may not have included solid grounding in principles of higher mathematics.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very good, engaging book", "text": "I enjoyed reading this book.  It is a very good freshman effort. Well written and well edited. I enjoy in-depth character development, and find it all too often missing in many books today.  Loose ends and contradictions drive me bonkers. So to find that there weren't any obvious loose ends in this book and the characters were wonderfully developed along the journey, not by tedious outside descriptions, but by their actions, choices and even their turn of phrase, made me a very happy reader. The action was well treated as well, and all of it kept me up reading more pages at night than I had started out intending to read.<br /><br />I respect the author's different views on relationships and marriage, so the only criticism I have is based on personal preference: I would have preferred that the love interests in the story would have taken the plunge and gotten married, rather than just had sex.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Major Disappointment", "text": "I love \"Chinatown,\" and I love the BFI Film Classic series (at least the ones I've read up to now).  I found this one to be cringe-worthy, and not much more than a fustian, droning, classroom theoretical lecture on film noir, femme fatales, Oedipal heroes (yes!) and on and on and on.  The author is allegedly a professional film screenwriter, and although I've worked in feature film production for over 30 years, I've never heard of a single film that is attributed to him.  The entire monograph is about \"theory,\" and \"theoretical patterns.\"  There is ZERO discussion about the actual screenplay, apart from a few glancing references, and ZERO discussion about the actual production of the film itself.  And this latter element, is where ANY film is REALLY made - the split-second changes that are forced on a production crew because of location problems, actor problems, scheduling problems, script problems, etc., etc.  When I was a teen and young adult, I avidly read film magazines, and thought they were so complex and intellectual and bursting with ideas.  Then I started working in film production and realized what a bunch of malarkey all this film theory is!  Disillusioning, yeah, but so what?  Films are produced through hell and high water, and every single one that gets made (even the awful ones) is a miracle.  This book actually made me laugh - all the scholastic theory and gibberish that I KNOW was the farthest thing from the filmmakers' minds.  Want to read a GREAT BFI book?

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Classic Work on D-Day", "text": "An instant classic when originally published in 1959, The Longest Day continues to stand the test of time. As a first time reader I can fully understand the praise and longevity this volume has achieved.<br /><br />Cornelius Ryan was born in 1920 in Dublin, Ireland. While he didn\u2019t experience the fighting first hand he did experience the war from close quarters. During the war he served as a correspondent and flew in bombing missions with the U.S. Air Force and also covered the D-Day landings. This first hand knowledge of events no doubt served him well in the years it took to research and write this account.<br /><br />Ryan went directly to the sources for much of his research. He used war documents from many countries, used diaries from Generals and other military figures, and interviewed literally hundreds of participants, both soldiers and civilians. Here, we read the story of the great beach landing that ultimately led to the end of the Third Reich.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. The Wait describes the buildup and planning needed until the decision by Dwight Eisenhower to launch the invasion. The Night covers the glider and paratrooper assault and the goals of each. The sea of confusion that comes into play when targets are missed is conveyed to the reader in such a way as to show the fear these men must have felt. The Day describes the beach assault and the horrors, and death, the soldiers faced.<br /><br />Throughout, one sees over and over again how the German high command failed to heed what in hindsight are obvious signals and warnings about the attack. Air power was moved from the coast, Rommel was headed to meet with the Fuhrer, lower level generals seemed clueless and all along, nobody believed the assault to be the real deal. From Hitler down, or perhaps because of Hitler\u2019s belief, it was assumed this was just a jab and the attempted knockout blow would be delivered elsewhere.<br /><br />Even once the full assault was underway few were willing to adjust their beliefs let alone stand up to Hitler. In fact, the Fuhrer was not even awakened to inform him of what was happening. Had the Germans been more aware the outcome of June 6, 1944 could have been different.<br /><br />This is not a \u201cwhat if\u201d book however and the Germans, with no air support and little leadership, were caught off guard. The actions of the following days, weeks, and months are not told here. This book deals only with June 6. We ultimately know the result however.<br /><br />While an easily readable book there is a major failing here and I do not know if it through Mr. Ryan or the publisher. The book is sorely in need of maps; the version of the text I read contained none. When I say maps, I mean it needs many. French geography is not my strongpoint and so I was lost in terms of where things were happening.<br /><br />Despite my concern about maps I can highly recommend this title for anybody interested in the western theatre of World War II. From the novice, such as myself, to the reader who has read more deeply about the war, there is something to be learned here.", "images": [], "asin": "0671890913", "parent_asin": "0671890913", "user_id": "AGWIMHTYKLJC3D7QYHT7LO53I6UQ", "timestamp": 1446245984000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Hip re-envisioning of classical mythology", "text": "Amelia (after Earhart), the self-named first-person narrator of the Children of Chaos trilogy, is a quirky, gutsy young woman who learns, early in ORPHANS OF CHAOS, that she can see into and move through dimensions beyond the three that normal folks perceive. It turns out that she and her companions are hostages against the good behavior of their parents, partisans of the Titans, the gods who in classical mythology overthrew the first generation of gods and were in turn overturned by the third generation. Virtually all of the characters can be found in references on classical mythology. For reasons not yet clear, the ages-old war between generations of gods is being fought out (at least in part) on present-day earth. The hostages yearn for freedom, and slowly recognize they can use their powers to escape their captors.<br /><br />I was initially impressed with the way Wright handled speaking in the voice of a teenage girl. I was therefore deeply disappointed when, around p. 150, it turns out that spunky and self-possessed Amelia actually longs to be dominated by men, ordered around by men, and punished by men. Wright explains her appetite for domination as a result of supernatural attack, but the sexual politics of Amelia's desires (and Wright's fixations on bondage and spanking) taint the book. I also found the constant sexual banter uncharacteristic for a group of children who grew up together in such close quarters; I would expect more caution and respect among them. If I recall correctly, Wright's sexual politics were also pretty bad in his Golden Age series. This is particularly disappointing in a lauded young writer.<br /><br />While ORPHANS OF CHAOS has many flaws, it is nevertheless enjoyable and provocative (when it's not outright offensive). I like it better so far than his Golden Age trilogy, which also drew quite a bit on classical mythology. I hesitate to recommend the book because of its backwards sexual politics and annoying sexual banter, but I can't entirely condemn it either.

There are plenty of dune lovers out there that call the Kevin and Brian Dune books \" crap \", or \" McDune books \" because Frank Herbert didn't write them. I am not one of those people. I think Kevin and Brian's work has been overall great and they have continued to breathe life into the greatest SciFi series ever. I would put Hosue Corrino, House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and Butlerian Jihad up against any of the Dune books after the original any day of the week.<br /><br />That said this book was even worse than Sisterhood of Dune (the previous book). Here are a few brief problems I had, I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum.<br /><br />- Hyla and Andros. How in the hell do you not include these characters from Sisterhood in this book? They were the 2 most compelling antagonist's in the previous book and you had them eaten by sandworms half way through Sisterhood. I expected them to come back in Mentat's but sadly they never did. This was a colossal waste and frankly, bewildering.<br /><br />- Cymeks. So we are to understand that the most brilliant businessman in the galaxy (Venport), a man fighting the rise of the Butlerian movement (anti-tech / thinking machines) seeks to turn the public view in his favor by creating and releasing new versions of Cymeks to kill humans? Really? His plan to rally humanity on his side is to resurrect the technology that enslaved them? This was not logical writing.<br /><br />- The Sisterhood. Two Books, both putting a lot of weight and writing into who the chosen successor of the Sisterhood would be and the writers decide, oh, let's just make it both Vayla and Doretta at the end. That was the best solution you could come up with? Talk about a letdown.<br /><br />- Emperor Corrino. His whole character was just hollow. House Corrino did such an amazing job on covering palace intrigue and the secrets of state that I just don't think anything  regarding the Emperor or his brother Roderick in this book was interesting at all. The authors seemed to just throw in some cruelty to make the Emperor more interesting but he was neutered the entire book and his brother Roderick while capable, just didn't have anything to do in the book.<br /><br />- The Fremen. They were pretty much nonexistent in this book and the last. It follows 1 small group of Fremen who try to take up work in the Emperium away from their Sietch. Boring, obvious, and completely pointless to the story. They clearly just threw in some Fremen at the last minute. It was blatant, ridiculous, and utterly without point.<br /><br />Those are a few of the problems I had with it but there were many many more.

I love watching it when it comes on TV (thank goodness for DVRs!). The opportunity arose to review a book called Toto's Tale. At first, I said to myself that I wouldn't review it because it would be too much like a kids book, with lots of pictures and kind of goofy. Not so. Well, I mean it is goofy, but not in the way I was expecting. Goofy in a humorous sort of way. It does say that this book is juvenile fiction/fantasy but I think most anyone who LOVES The Wizard of Oz AND books will love this sweet little tale!<br /><br />Toto's Tale is told in the point of view of Toto. Yep that's right. The dog. He smells the storm brewing that will lift up the house and twist them and twitch them each way and land them on the wicked witch of the east. What's funny about this little book is that from a dog's point of view, going to Oz is HILARIOUS! The laughs and smiles were certainly rolling off my face when I read this book. Dorothy is his pet girl and he must protect, but then he makes some friends along the way. Some of these friends, were not in the original Wizard Of Oz but still, he makes them and the comics really start rolling then!<br /><br />Again, I say that this book is juvenile fiction/fantasy, but it's a great, sweet read for most anyone.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Completely unoriginal", "text": "There was some promise in the blurb of this book, which is why I picked it up to read, but then I realized it was just a rehash and remix of a bunch of other stories. *The Point* tells the story of a young adult who is wasting her amazing potential until a dramatic event gives her a choice of either going through a grueling training she doesn\u2019t want or getting a punishment. But as it turns out our reluctant protagonist turns out to be the great promising future for her people, especially since the vaguely hinted antagonist has the potential power to bring about an apocalypse. That makes our hero the one true future hope. Nevertheless, she must endure antagonism from her jealous classmates as well as incredibly cruel treatment from the teachers she\u2019s supposed to trust. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Yes, *The Point* is a mix of Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and the Divergent series with an antagonist who is a straight rip-off of Jessica Jones\u2019 Killgrave. The only thing unique here is the setting which is not quite West Point, but a secret alt-version of the Point just for superhumans buried under the real West Point. But it was never adequately explained why this was placed there, why they were training these people to be officers, especially since most of them\u2014apart from their powers\u2014seemed profoundly not to be Army officer material.<br /><br />Then there are the editorial problems. I can only hope that the review copy I read wasn\u2019t the final version because it wasn\u2019t just typos. At one point, several of the characters must have been different genders because, for paragraphs at a time, the wrong pronouns were used. At another point, the author forgot he told us that the character had a pretty good buzz, because then a couple pages later he tells us that she hasn\u2019t yet got a buzz on. Speaking of which, our protagonist is 18 years old and yet she drinks with no problem in a bar outside of West Point, while the author had just had someone telling another character they couldn\u2019t drink because of being underage. So why could our hero drink? No explanation. Those may seem like minor problems, but they are just a couple examples of the many structural and editing issues with this book.<br /><br />But what most put me off of this book was the incredible casual cruelty. What is it with young adult literature these days that they must always combine world-shattering stakes with incredible cruelty to the protagonist and their companions, not by their enemies, but the people who are supposed to be their mentors. Why can\u2019t we tell smaller stories? Not there shouldn\u2019t be important stakes, but what about consequences that are important to just, say, the protagonist. Okay, put their life on the line. But why must every story be about an incredibly evil enemy who must be destroyed to save the universe? It gets boring after a while.<br /><br />Bottom line is that *The Point* is not a book I can recommend.", "images": [], "asin": "1101967560", "parent_asin": "1101967560", "user_id": "AFWOJPC5VKJY4OGDKU2ICCWUAMBA", "timestamp": 1534016375460, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Thoughtful, heartfelt, and uplifting", "text": "Steven Kotler's tale of his move, with the woman he loved, from LA to the beautifully-wild but impoverished Chimayo, New Mexico, to give their rescue dogs the space they needed works on several levels: as a memoir describing a man looking for authentic meaning in his life, as the compassionately-told story of the abused, abandoned, and unwanted dogs he and his wife have worked with, and as a thought-provoking call to re-examine our relationship with not only dogs but animals in general. Kotler uses the story of his journey to explore a variety of fascinating topics from whether animals laugh to how both animal and mixed-species groups enter a state of flow to the use of hallucinogens by and homosexuality among animals. There's a great deal to be learned from this fascinating and deeply-compassionate book.<br /><br />That said, I found the story initially a bit hard to get into. Though I love dogs and have adopted many rescues over the years, the couple's initial plan seemed so doomed, it was tough for me to relate to their decision to make the move.  I was won over by the couple's courage and wisdom - and of course the dogs themselves - but there were times Kotler's intellectual meandering wandered a bit far afield, into esoterica (in the latter part of the book) that had me skimming rather than hanging onto every word as I'd done earlier in the book.<br /><br />Overall, however, I highly recommend this for anyone interested in a thought-provoking and moving exploration of the relationship between animals and humans.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful New Fantasy Series", "text": "3.5 stars rounding to 4<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Defy. I went into this book without any idea what it was about, just that it was a new fantasy series, and I\u2019m always looking for new fantasy to read so I downloaded it asap.<br /><br />In Defy we meet Alexa Hollen\u2026 or Alex as she\u2019s better known. She\u2019s a member of the king\u2019s army, being forced to disguise herself as a boy in order to keep herself out of the situation that all other women are thrown into. With the help of her twin brother, Alex uses her skills to earn a position on the prince\u2019s guard.<br /><br />But this is where the main story begins. Even with her skills, she, Prince Damian and fellow guard and friend Rylan are abducted and dragged through the jungle to their enemy\u2019s gates. Where Alex soon finds out that things aren\u2019t exactly as she\u2019s been told, and the secret she and her brother were determined to keep, wasn\u2019t exactly as secret as they thought.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be straight up with you all\u2026 love triangle alert. But I think that is fairly evident based on the summary. I\u2019ll also be honest with you and tell you that I don\u2019t hate love triangles like I know some of you do. In this case, it\u2019s very evident to me who she is going to be with. But with this love triangle warning also comes an alert that this turned into being less about the situation Alexa finds herself in and more about how sexy the guys she is with are and I think ultimately that kind of frustrated me.<br /><br />The characters \u2013 while I didn\u2019t dislike any of them, I didn\u2019t immediately find myself clinging to any of them either. Is Prince Damian swoony \u2013 yes\u2026 is Rylan sweet and wonderful to Alex\u2026 yes\u2026 Is Alexa a strong-willed and independent young girl who can overcome anything \u2013 she sure is. All these things together didn\u2019t give me any strong feelings towards anyone in particular though. I just didn\u2019t feel that connection with anyone.<br /><br />My overall thoughts were this \u2013 The middle part of this book was slow going for me. I was incredibly bored during their trek through the jungle, but once we started to get a bit more action and less \u2018OMG who do I pick\u2019 I found myself enjoying the action and the unraveling of secrets. I think ultimately this is what saved this book for me, we ended up on a high note and I truly found myself finally enjoying the story.<br /><br />I think that for me, this was less fantasy and more YA romance with fantasy elements and I found myself hooked just enough there at the end to know that I will definitely be picking up book 2 in this series to see what Larson does and where this story goes.<br /><br />If you\u2019re looking for a quick read that is hopefully just the start to a wonderful new fantasy series, definitely check this one out!<br /><br />Thank you to netgalley & Scholastic for the advance copy in exchange for my honest thoughts.", "images": [], "asin": "0545597587", "parent_asin": "0545597587", "user_id": "AEN5SFCSO5L4XDEHZ7B4LYYICXJQ", "timestamp": 1414854015000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "So which is it -- New Deal, or raw deal?", "text": "Raw. Clearly, if the author's book were instead touting President Franklin Roosevelt's \"New Deal,\" he would have titled the book something like, \"Some Fools Say It Was a RAW Deal\"!<br /><br />Suppose FDR had actually kept his presidential campaign promises to cut spending and taxes, and eliminate the tariffs from the Smoot-Hawley Bill right away? Such were indeed his promises, but these did not happen except for small reductions in Smoot-Hawley. FDR did have some understanding about the economics behind these issues, yet he chose to go in the opposite direction. \"New Deal or Raw Deal?\" explores why. The New Deal did serve President Roosevelt well, even as the economic numbers told an opposite story for almost a decade. Simply explained, FDR discovered he could promise one thing during campaigns, then do something quite different after taking office, as long as enough constituencies got their subsidies. Fulsom notes that this happens currently.<br /><br />At the core, the author points out that the nation's founders did not intend to create a utopia. They instead created a country on exciting new principles of individualism tempered by experience, where fidelity and working by the rules counted more than good intentions. Fulsom saves his harshest talk for historians Arthur Schlessinger and William Leuchtenburg, the ones he holds most responsible for perpetuating the many myths about the New Deal. He accuses these two of giving priority to compassion over experience.<br /><br />Libertarians will likely fault Fulsom's statements about the Federal Reserve's actions before and during the Great Depression, believing that he would benefit from study into economists' work like Murray Rothbard's discussion of that important period in history. Still, as the author says, many businesses today find themselves uncertain about future taxes, regulations, and Fed monetary actions, very much like the Great Depression era. This alone is an excellent reason to get Fulsom's book.", "images": [], "asin": "1416592377", "parent_asin": "1416592377", "user_id": "AF47V2KBMY3GIYNYPPJSKZFCSG7A", "timestamp": 1290145517000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic!

The store is closed but the guy looks nice, he is handsome and seems genuine about it being his 1 year anniversary with his girlfriend, so she lets him in. He gets her with chloroform after she turns around to wrap up his gift.<br /><br />The story is told from the ten months after the day she was abducted when she is back at home. She was held for over seven months and she is trying to come to terms with what happened. She came back in pieces as she describes it (PTSD in psychological terms), but she refuses to talk to the psychologists she tried because of different issues, one used candles that smelled like the ones her captor \u201cthe monster\u201d used, another treated her like she was crazy.<br /><br />So Jane decides to write about her experience as a form of therapy, both her time in captivity and since she got home. So the book goes back and forth, then (from her kidnapping forward) to now (present). As Jane tries to understand everything that happened to her and work through her trauma, we as readers are finding out what happened in the order it happened and also finding out how it is affecting her now that she is at home.<br /><br />As you would expect, Jane is having trouble adjusting at home. She went through various types of physical and mental torture while in captivity, though I won\u2019t give any spoilers as to what those were but to say it wasn\u2019t a standard kidnapping. The book had my emotions going all over the place, I was feeling for Jane so much.<br /><br />I felt so bad for her when she was free but trying to recreate her own room to be more like the room in captivity. She knew it is better being free, but almost feels safer in that room where nobody can get her or talk to her. I cried throughout half of the book because it was heart wrenching.<br /><br />\u201cI run.<br />Because I can\u2019t sleep.<br />Because Memory can\u2019t catch me if I keep a fast pace.<br />Because my parents\u2019 door is closed, but Night can\u2019t shut me out.<br />Because I\u2019m not supposed to be out at this hour, especially after everything, especially all alone\u2014and so it feels a little like power.\u201d<br /><br />As Jane gets further in her story and continues to struggle with being at home, her Mother tries to get her back to normal by forcing her to go out or to see her friends. Her Mom can\u2019t heal until Jane heals, which puts more pressure on Jane. Jane struggles with her feelings for Mason who was one of the other people held captive and was able to cut a small hole in the wall so they could hold hands. Her struggles with the reasons for why \u201cthe monster\u201d took her were hardest of all.<br /><br />\u201cWhat do you feel most nervous about?\u201d<br />\u201cFacing the truth, I guess.\u201d<br />\u201cThe truth about . . .\u201d<br />\u201cWhat happened when I was taken.\u201d I study her face, trying to figure out if she knows my story, if she saw it on the news or read it in the papers.<br /><br />I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

The horror aspect of this story was deliciously creepy and was a by-product of the abuse of Vera by her parents, Francis and Daphne, and by other actions on their part. The child abuse was not easy to read, but it needed to be explored to fully explain what was happening in the story and to develop the horror aspect. Daphne's abuse was overt: cruel, critical and jealousy-driven.  Francis's abuse was more his teaching Vera the wrong things. He was a serial killer and set a vicious and violent example. He explained to Vera he was just trying to help his victims.  As a young girl, she misunderstood that \u201chelp\u201d as a positive thing. I think she would have followed in Francis\u2019s footsteps had she not been stopped by his confession to his crimes and hers.

In any event, Vera's life was difficult, and she grew up wrong and confused and wanting to be loved.  She only wanted a sister or a friend who would support and help her.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Skip it...", "text": "I listened to the audio book and the narrator Kyle McCarley did a fantastic job. He is the only reason why I finished the book. Because if I had read this it would've been DNF less than 50 pages in.<br /><br />This book is the a reminder for me to be careful what I wish for. The last couple of books I read were sorely lacking in world building, this book took it too far. I could see everything because the details were written that intricately. To the point of boredom. Rooms, clothes, jewelry. Names of titles of nobles, religious leaders, and ceremonies were invented. Which is great, but there were so many it was hard to keep track. Standard names like Lord and Priest would've worked too for lesser characters. I also found it weird that all these intricate names and ceremonies were created, but the animals were standard. And although there was mention of magic there wasn't any in this book.<br /><br />Maia, our hero was boring. The standard orphan forced out of seclusion. The problem is there was nothing outstanding about him. He was nice, but no saint. He was smart, but no genius. He wasn't ugly by Elf society standards, but he was no great beauty either. There was nothing about him that stood out. Nothing to make the reader root for him to \"win\". He was a competent ruler, but no champion of the people. If they had killed him off and replaced him at any point in the book I honestly wouldn't have cared.<br /><br />That is another problem with this story. For one that focused on political intrigue and court politics it was lacking both. Starting with our main character. His banishment being accepted by everyone made no sense. His mother a goblin was married to his father to foster an alliance. So her being banished with her baby right after giving birth for the crime of not being an Elf was beyond stupid. Her father the Goblin Emperor should've had more of a reaction. Then she dies and her son, a Prince is sent off to west bubble fuq. Again the Goblin Emperor does nothing. A man with no male heir. He didn't even send a tutor. Maia the fourth son of the Elf Kingdom and the only Prince of the Goblin Kingdom wasn't educated in anything by anyone. He was sent of to rot, when he should've been a pawn his entire life. There were almost no plots at court, no maneuvering.  Just snobs being jerks.<br /><br />It takes forever for there to be any real conflict and even longer for us to find out what happened to his father and brothers. And both things are resolved with relative ease. How does something finally exciting happen, yet it almost instantly becomes boring too. I really don't understand how this book got nominated for so many awards. It must've been a slow year. I won't say I won't ever read this author again, but I won't be reading any more books in this series.", "images": [], "asin": "B094LL1GVT", "parent_asin": "B094LL1GVT", "user_id": "AHVZVOTCYCNGJIBJC2F5HOYFBKVA", "timestamp": 1626844509983, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "\"...a journey toward...self -acceptance and perspective.\"", "text": "I loved this book, almost from its opening pages.  What function as somewhat parallel stories, related stories, \"Orphan Train\" is peopled with characters that you will come to love and care for, and, as harsh as the circumstances often are, wish for them the very best of outcomes.  Christina Baker Kline's previous book, \"A Bird In Hand,\" was a Vine selection some while ago.  I enjoyed it but I love this story so much more.  \"Orphan Train\"...there were such, and over many years they brought in excess of 200,000 homeless children of varied ages to stops along the way in the Midwest and far West, in the hopes of finding homes for them.  Didn't seem to matter whether the homes turned out to be good homes; rather it was almost an effort to remove orphans from the scene, scatter them, often without any care or concerrn as to the circumstances into which they might be taken.  \"Orphan Train\" is a beautifully realized story, moving us back and forth in time from the late 1920's Minnesota to 2011 Maine, back and forth as the pages unfold.  Most memorable, of course, will be our interaction with Niamh (later to be named Vivian) and Molly, Niamh an immigrant girl, who, through circumstances, comes to be on the orphan train, Molly a girl of the present, about to \"age out\" of foster care.  The paths of these two characters cross just when perhaps both need the other the most.  You'll be pulled into this relationship and Vivian's incredible story, perhaps finding, as I did, that the book was impossible to put down.  This is a memorable piece of writing, a lovely novel of which author Baker Kline can be so proud.  She cloaks her history lesson in a tale that will move you, sometimes anger you, but always inspire you as roads, by chance, are taken by these characters, leading them to the book's lovely conclusion.", "images": [], "asin": "0061950726", "parent_asin": "0061950726", "user_id": "AHQPHTOVRPQOZQUSFLDUBAUI3XGA", "timestamp": 1366908703000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

Instead, it is fascinating and riveting, providing EVERY important direct source document associated with the U.S., from its birth to its continuation into the modern age.<br /><br />Brilliantly, editors Bruun and Crosby have also managed to include \"documents\" almost never included in history books -- speeches, articles and even poetry -- related to the primary documents of the events of the particular period.<br /><br />For example, official documents pertaining to the Great Depression are reprinted, along with a section from John Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath,\" a novel of people who lived and suffered through those Dust Bowl days. Likewise, not only is the Executive Order interning Japanese Americans during World War II included, so is a side-bar describing the impact on Japanese American families who lost all of their property.<br /><br />In an age when everything in society seems to revolve around the latest technological advancement, it is very centering to go through this book and read the true historical achievements of these incredible United States. Vividly illustrating its tragedies, as well as the justice and injustice done in the name of this nation, this book is truly like no other.<br /><br />From the Declaration of Independence and the courts, to the true voices of vaunted politicians in their own words as well as the views of everyday citizens, events come to life in as astonishing a publishing accomplishment to come along in decades.<br /><br />With a \"couldn't-be-cheaper\" price, this edition deserves to be in every home, library and school room in America. Even if you thought you knew the history of the United States from sea to shining sea, there is plenty inside these pages to surprise, delight or even sadden and sicken the most careful scholar.<br /><br />Looked at in its entirety, this single volume not only educates, but in this new millennium, provides a sobering atmosphere to ponder the future of the country and every person's role as a responsible citizen.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "We Built These Cities", "text": "Today I'm looking at the City and the City by China Mieville. This is a science fiction book that came out a little over a decade ago. I want to like this author's works mainly because he's a comrade. I first read him a couple of years back when he did that version of the Russian Revolution called October. It was a historical novel that was like Ten Days that Shook the world but was better than Ten Days that Shook the World. Since then, I've read a couple of his books, This Census Taker and Three Moments of an explosion and Neither were particularly memorable.<br /><br /> This book is a New York Times bestseller and one that you go to and it's supposed to be one of his better ones. If you read the blurbs and just try to get a sense of what's that about you really might not know. The basic premise is that there are two cities that exist independently but in the same geographical space. The people who live in those cities are trained from their youth to ignore what's going on right next to him if they get the signals and the cues that it is from one of them the other City. The thing is that it just didn't really work for me. It was about page 74 and I realized that I was getting most of the World building for this aspect that I was going to get as a reader. I just said I don't believe it. Now here's the thing, everything else is good enough that despite me not believing the world building and the central premise I still want to keep reading.<br /><br />There's a murder mystery and that very Central thing plays huge role in it. What it really got me thinking was what this two-city thing really represented. Was it some geographical political commentary, which I think is a reading that is the end of the easiest to do because it seems like it's right there for analysis? There's also the possibility that isn't there a bigger metaphysical thing. I kept asking myself  are these people already dead are they in purgatory I don't know. The problem with that is there are  people that come in from outside and visit the cities. And then they leave again so that might not be the best reading. Overall, I did read it and I enjoyed it, but I just tried really had to not think about that central thing of the setting because the minute I started thinking of the central premise it didn't work so just kind of was that thing if you ignore the man behind the curtain it's okay but like that curtain just really lamp shaded.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810aPMY3qML._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "034549752X", "parent_asin": "034549752X", "user_id": "AEP6VSEK3Y5MHGJCG2RGHM2EHCLA", "timestamp": 1611703856834, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

I don't know why this is titled \"The lost Superfoods Book for Beginners / Survival Food Guide & Cookbook for Year Supply and Storage\"  There is no info about food storing for a year, no superfoods, so far I don't see any recipes meant to be created out of long term storage foods. Their is no instruction about prepping or survival other than to list the 25 recipes double spaced. Many regular recipes with regular food from fridge, freezer, etc. The gravy and biscuits recipe calls for refrigerator canned biscuits?  You know the kind that you score and they make the loud popping noise. Seriously!! Chili, pasta, yogurt and fruit cups using store made yogurt?? Pasta & meatballs, mac & cheese, for example all use butter, frozen or fresh meat and normal ingredients. Jimmy Dean sausage was listed in one of the ingredient lists. LOL Their are a couple of recipes called Pemmican and Hard Tack that are true long term foods, a jerky recipe but other than that, this is a very poor regular cookbook of worthless recipes that any newbie can find online to learn how to cook basic foods, this is not for long term survival food recipes.

Mankind reached the stars in the 21st century, but at the end of this century Earth was devastated by a war between the great powers. A colony world called Sparta founded the first \"Empire of Man\" which kept the peace for five hundred years, but then as several worlds tried to break away, another series of wars broke out, the Session wars, which devastated most of the worlds of human space.<br /><br />Prince Samual's world, where the story begins, was twice bombarded from space and blasted back to a renaissance level of culture. By the time the Empire made contact again in 3013, just before this book starts, they've made it back to about the level of technology Earth had in the early 20th century. The planet Makassar, a few light years away, was even worse hit, and is struggling to maintain even a medieval level of culture and technology.<br /><br />Sparta and the Empire's home worlds also suffered, but after the war finally spluttered out around 2870 AD, the Second Empire has been proclaimed and Sparta is gradually re-establishing control of human space. They are grimly determined to make sure that nobody ever gets a chance to launch another interstellar war.<br /><br />The hero of the book is Colonel, or rather former Colonel, Nathan McKinnie, lately the commander of the best regiment in the army of the former state of Orleans - until an Imperial vessel allied to the rival nation of Haven blew his soldiers to bits. The Empire needs a world government to work through in order to annex Prince Samual's World, and the easiest way to get one is to help King David of Haven conquer the planet. What they don't realise is that King David and certain of his ministers know they are being used as puppets and are grimly determined to keep as much independence for the planet as they can.<br /><br />As a former opponent of Haven, Nathan McKinnie is astonished to get a job offer from one of the most sinister figures in King David's government. If Prince Samual's world can build a spaceship before being taken into the Empire, the planet will keep more independence and privilages. As someone says in the book, \"we can make them take us as subjects, not slaves.\" But the nearest place where they might be able to get information on how to build one is a few light years away - in an old First Empire library, on the planet Makassar, where the last remnants of even a feudal civiliation are about to be over-run by thousands of barbarians ...<br /><br />If you have enjoyed any of the \"Future History series like \"The mote in God's Eye\" or it's sequels, \"[[ASIN:0671795740 The Gripping Hand]]\" and \"[[ASIN:0615434142 Outies (Mote Series, Book 3)]],\" you will love this book.", "images": [], "asin": "0356085066", "parent_asin": "0356085066", "user_id": "AHVA3FI44KMTDRWUGAVXWKEJ5AAQ", "timestamp": 1353152269000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

I'm docking him a star for failing to finish the series. I'll revise this and give him back the fifth star here, if he ever does.<br /><br />C\u2019mon, man!<br /><br />Here, our characters pick up the trail of rogue Russian scientist Anatoly Reznikov, designer of a dangerous virus already used to attack the US and Russia.<br /><br />Two years earlier, Russian mobsters broke Reznikov out of a thought-to-be-secure CIA facility, where he was being interrogated by Karl Berg.<br /><br />His trail now suddenly reappears. A joint US-Russian covert strike against a secret lab in India destroys it - but barely misses Reznikov. Who tipped him? Who busted him out? Who\u2019s got him now? What\u2019s he up to? The US and Russia both seemed to want Reznikov, an embarrassment, forgotten.<br /><br />Berg knows the world won\u2019t be safe until Reznikov is dead. Meanwhile he picks up the scent of a scary plot on the homefront. It might involve Reznikov, but it\u2019s way bigger than just him.<br /><br />There\u2019s a whole lot for Konkoly to finish here. At the end (sorry for any spoilers, but too bad) we\u2019ve got Reznikov just having been smuggled into a secret underground lab a la \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d.

A top secret Russian group had been dispatched to kill Sanderson - but he talks their leader into cooperating instead.<br /><br />Have both governments now decided they want Reznikov back in business? Are they cooperating? Why?<br /><br />It\u2019ll be up to the Petroviches and Sanderson\u2019s handful of survivors, led by the deeply wounded Berg and Audra Bauer, to suss out the Ajax Conspiracy, find Reznikov and somehow kill the whole thing off before it kills them.<br /><br />C\u2019mon, man!", "images": [], "asin": "B01N55RI2N", "parent_asin": "B01N55RI2N", "user_id": "AGLSC3ZESDAQWTZ3JNTDE7TUBU2A", "timestamp": 1643387123002, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Exceptional look at the Future of High Tech Weapons and Cyber Warfare\u2003", "text": "Ghost Fleet is a look at a future, in which China takes on the US with a combination of Cyber Warfare, modified stolen technologies from around the world, and some support from countries such as Russia.<br />Whilst I will discuss various aspects of the book, I will try not to give away any major spoilers.<br />The story was very reminiscent of a modern day \u2018Red Storm Rising\u2019, except that this time there is no resource crisis, and the US is the central battle scene.<br />The story itself is a fascinating exploration of the various strategies, technologies, weapons and methodologies that would be employed in a modern theatre of war. There is a distinct difference to how Naval and Air combat will be fought today, as opposed to how it was fought back in the previous century.<br />The addition of Cyber Warfare, hacking, information technology etc, is already having an impact on the world today, and the authors of the book show with some fascinating and terrifying clarity the impacts it will have on the 21st Century Warfighter.<br />There has been a lot of discussion over the years about China using their vast resources to \u2018hack\u2019 other world powers and \u2018steal\u2019 their technology, and either directly copy it, or reverse engineer it and make it work better or more efficiently. Ghost Fleet endeavours to capture this practice, but in a slightly more fictional manner, giving us an insight into the hacking process, as well as showing us the better engineered tech as a result.<br />The book is obviously a stimulating exploration of future technology, but the Authors have been clever and wrapped it in a creative thriller, exploring the personal lives of several main characters to give the story some depth and relay a personal aspect as well. This has also allowed them to explore not only the human impact of this future war, but also the Political situation as well as some of the more Human technologies that are available in this future.<br />The Political situation in this book is rather interesting as it looks at a very fluid future, taking into account not just the technology, but also the stock markets, resources, mining, the space race as well as the major and minor countries and their influence over the Military and Political arena.<br />This was a rather interesting (and in some aspects rather frightening) look into the future that potentially awaits us, even more so with the current selection of US Presidential Candidates. Ghost Fleet attacks from all angles to provide a comprehensive view of a technologically thrilling future in which war seems not only inevitable, but that technology will play a much bigger part in than ever before.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Hey Box, the bad guys are the WP, not the FBI", "text": "Why did I decide to tread \u201cWolf Pack\u201d (WP) by C J Box?  It\u2019s the 19th in his series on Wyoming Wild game warden Joe Pickett, I had read the first in the series and reviewed if favorably back in 2002, and hadn\u2019t read another since.  I usually read a lot of crime fiction, bios, and history and was looking for something different.  I love the West (reside on the East Coast), but in my humble opinion the pickin\u2019s are slim in terms of modern day writing talent.<br /><br />Though I rate WP a 4 on Amazon I think that\u2019s a bit inflated and I will score a 3 \u00bd on LibraryThing.  WP has a lot of very strong positives, but also some negatives that really turned me off.  So, much like the scenery of Wyoming, a lot of peaks and valleys.  Let\u2019s start with the pluses.  A lot of good description of the background with real name places, locales you can look up on Bing and Google Maps and explore yourself a bit even if you\u2019re 2000 miles away.  A very good plot.  A mysterious family has settled in the area, bringing with them a rather extraordinary level of security.  Most readers will tumble to the reason why faster than any of the good guys in WP though.  Some interesting scenes involving drones and what they can do to/for wildlife.  A very interesting cast of bad guys, very credible, horrifying.  An excellent climax, really well done.  The tension amps up very nicely throughout the second half of the book, and the extended climax is one of the few I have read that is not dragged down by a series on mini climaxes.  Sounds like 5 stars so far, even as I write this, but\u2026.<br /><br />One of the problems I have with a setting like this one can best be illustrated by some of the very popular BBC mysteries we are blessed with.  A current favorite of my household is Midsomer Murders. Great stories every week, typically 3-4 victims in every 90 minute show.  The problem is that the setting is a village somewhere or the other in England where everyone knows each other, patronizes each other\u2019s businesses, and kills each other.  If anyone were keeping a tab, I think the whole town would be gone by season 3 or so, much like Christie\u2019s \u201c10 Little Indians\u201d, perhaps redone as \u201c200 Little Brits\u201d.  Ok, so you have to suspend reality a bit, I get that, but still.  Secondly, I\u2019m not crazy about Joe, he sorta comes in a plain vanilla wrapper, but when you open the package, what\u2019s inside is plain vanilla.  Joe seems best in this story at just keeping out of the way.  Sorry, but I prefer heroes.  My third and last knock is a bit political, and upfront I must say I have no idea of the author\u2019s politics nor his intent here, I can only comment on my reaction.  There are two FBI characters  (and later a third but to a lesser degree) in WP that are over the top.  Obnoxious, pushy, bullying, lying, intimidating, entrapping, non-cooperative, unprincipled, and ten more such adjectives.  I understand that polls will tell you that many US citizens have that perception of the FBI, particularly in red states.  There is a bit of a defense of the two characters approach offered by others but its lame.  I am sure there are some that would suggest the author might be pandering to his audience, or in his defense is only re-emphasizing locals\u2019 views of Federal Government in general.  My bottomline is that I thought it was a poor decision to do this now,  given all the internal attacks on our intelligence services over the past two years.", "images": [], "asin": "B07FLZYJD8", "parent_asin": "B07FLZYJD8", "user_id": "AG7BOX7LSHKRG37TUNSUWXNYY6EQ", "timestamp": 1559913750270, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "4.5 \u2013 A Fantastic Heartwrenching YA Paranormal Romance", "text": "Summoner by S.D. Grimm surprised me in so many ways and it was pretty fantastic! To be honest, this book was not what I expected it to be, but that turned out to be a really good thing.<br /><br />Grimm\u2019s writing is beautiful, evocative, and had a nice flow that made it easy to read. The premise is intriguing and had me hooked from the very first page. I thought the idea of witching and summoning spirits was quite fascinating and I wanted to know more about it. The plot is fast-paced and full of action. The mystery, suspense, and danger had me holding my breath a few times and I absolutely loved it!<br /><br />The characters are so well written and realistic. I liked Allie from the start and I understood her reasons for doing what she did. Cody is very caring and kind that seeing him so guilt-ridden was distressing. Both Allie and Cody are dealing with their own losses and struggling with grief that my heart completely broke for them. It just seemed so right that they would find comfort in each other. While there was an instant attraction between Allie and Cody, I thought their chemistry felt genuine and real. Watching them help each other heal and develop a playful and sweet relationship was so satisfying. Their bantering and flirting made me smile and swoon so much.... instalove or not, I totally ship Allie and Cody and I rooted for them the entire time.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love that Summoner is not your typical young adult paranormal romance. There\u2019s definitely the supernatural fantasy aspect, the mysterious hard to resist hot guy, and plenty of adorable flirting. BUT more than that, this book deals with difficult real life issues. Grimm does a terrific job portraying the sadness of losing someone you love and the agony of living with guilt. She shows how healing and learning to forgive yourself are not that easy and will take time. I really wasn\u2019t expecting this to be deeply affecting or heartbreaking, but that\u2019s what makes this story brilliant and so powerful. And yes\u2026 I absolutely recommend that everyone pick this up!<br /><br />I received an advanced reader copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a fair review.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Hardly a substitute for the anime, but still a great read.", "text": "&quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; has been dubbed one of the greatest anime series ever, and rightfully so. Its plots are original and action-packed, its dub has been called one of the best ever done, and its characters are some of the most beloved characters in the anime community. So it's no surprise that TOKYOPOP decided to bring the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga to the States. Using TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga is a set of stories told within the universe of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; before the final set of episodes. Sadly, the manga is nothing compared to the anime masterpiece; even so, fans of the series and fans of manga in general owe it to themselves to give this manga a look at least.<br />The anime series follows an episode-like format for the most of its 26-episode run (meaning episodes don't have overlapping storylines), and the manga is no different. The first volume of the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga presents four different stories that deal with the characters of the &quot;Bebop&quot;, following their adventures and misadventures as they try to nab bounties so they can collect the reward money and get food in their stomachs. Almost any &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; fan will praise the anime series as having highly original stories and adventures that define the series. Unfortunately, that same fan will most likely look at the stories in the manga and say they are formulaic. Also, the stories has odd pacing issues in several areas, making the volume feel a little unbalanced. Even so, the stories are quite entertaining and do capture some of the charm of the anime. But anyone hoping the manga will hold over as a substitute for the anime until the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; movie arrives on American shores will be sorely disappointed.<br />Visually, some fans might be put off by the artist's interpretation of the characters. Characters in the manga do resemble their anime counterparts, but sometimes they can look a tad-bit distorted. And seeing Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein in chibi-like forms can be a little awkward, considering this rarely happened in the anime. Still, the visual artwork of the manga isn't anything to be disgusted at, but fans of the anime will wants to approach this with caution.<br />In terms of translation, I can honestly say that TOKYOPOP is getting better. Previous efforts such as &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; and &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; used text that was most likely typed in a machine, resulting in several horrible typos, and TOKYOPOP has always been known to deliver mediocre translations. With &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, the text appears to be drawn and not typed, resulting in fewer typos; I couldn't find any at all in this volume. While the translation might be questionable to some people, it doesn't sound static and flat; I actually consider this one of TOKYOPOP's better efforts. And with TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Format&quot;, the volume is read right-to-left, giving it a more authentic feel. It also makes the artwork clearer to see; since it hasn't been photo-reversed, the artwork isn't blurred, dimmed, or distorted.<br />All in all, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; is a good manga series, but only for the right kind of person. Fans of the anime will want to be careful with this series, and manga readers unfamiliar with the anime should also be wary. Still, the manga is very entertaining and is good enough to hold the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; name. And thanks to TOKYOPOP's better-than-normal translation and their &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga can be enjoyed even further.<br />Until volume 2, &quot;SEE YOU, SPACE COWBOY...&quot;", "images": [], "asin": "1931514917", "parent_asin": "1931514917", "user_id": "AHXBKVVSXTNUDA2ZOVDW37NTXWJQ", "timestamp": 1019443683000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "&quot;Part beauty mark, part brand, a legacy of tribal values.&quot;", "text": "In this poignant and sometimes melancholy account of the passing of an era, Mira Kamdar tells the story of her beloved grandmother Motiba, a woman from the agrarian and pastoral culture of old Gujarat, showing how the changes in Motiba's life and family during the past seventy years are also emblematic of dramatic changes in Indian culture as a whole.  Herself the daughter of Motiba's son Prabhakar (Pete) and Lois Christensen, the Danish-American cowgirl he married while a student in the United States in the 1960's, Kamdar is especially sensitive to nuances of culture, and she brings her Indian family to life within the context of the country's history--her grandparents' marriage, her grandfather's adoption of the values of Mahatma Gandhi, the emigration of the family to Burma to manage their businesses there in the 1930's, the bombing of Rangoon by the Japanese during World War II, the return to Bombay, and eventually, the emigration of several of Motiba's children to the United States.<br />As she describes her own life, the author shifts her focus to that of the American immigrant experience.  The tales of Indian history which infused her life as a child visiting in India eventually give way completely to tales of her life in the United States, as she moves with her parents and siblings throughout the west following her father's job changes.  The significance of the death of Gandhi on her grandmother's life yields its place to the effects of the death of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King on her parents' and her own life.  Her father's desire to have his family &quot;fit in&quot; becomes more important to him than teaching them the language and culture in which he grew up.<br />Rich, warm, humorous, and earnest, Motiba's Tattoos recreates the universal story of an immigrant family's metamorphosis from one whose primary allegiance is to another culture to one in which opportunities to assimilate are recognized and embraced.  In the process of becoming American, uniquely personal values may evolve and be treasured, while retention of the old traditions must become a conscious effort.  What was an integral part of their family life, historically, evolves into pleasant memories and echoes of the old way of life as new generations appear--the final result of the Indian diaspora, which began in the mid-20th century and which continues, unabated, to the present day.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Still good, although the fictional parts are perhaps less believable", "text": "First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 31st May<br /><br />I very much liked the previous novel about King Edwin, Oswald\u2019s predecessor and nephew, by the same author. This one picks up and continues the story but with Oswald as the main character. As has been mentioned a number of times by many, little is known about the historical character of Oswald, but he has been a major source of inspiration, starting with Tolkien, and this book\u2019s subtitle (Return of the King) hints at.<br /><br />There is much to commend in this book, but also some things that did not work well for me.<br /><br />Among the positive elements are the influence on Oswald and the political role played by the monastery of Iona, and its abbot S\u00e9g\u00e9ne (a historical character) who do seem to have supported the Northumbrian\u2019s bid for the throne with a contingent of armed monks and his fight against Cadwallon, despite the latter being a Celt. His reward was to replace the Roman Church with the Celtic one. The monk Aidan, who does seem to have Oswald\u2019s friend, did become bishop and founded Lindinsfarne with the King\u2019s support.<br /><br />The political relations between the various kingdoms are just as well-presented as they were in the previous volume on Edwin, whether these were Celtic, Angles or Saxons. Of particular interest is the attitude of the Briton King of Rheged. While the personality of this king might be fictional, his behaviour - he was ready to side against Cadwallon King of Gwynedd in order maintain his own independence and prevent the Welsh king from becoming too powerful although both were Britons \u2013 seems to have been fairly typical of the period and shared among most Kings, irrespective of their origins.<br /><br />On a different note, the description of the ex-Roman fortress of Carlisle, the seat of the King of Rheged\u2019s power, is well-done and particularly interesting, just as that of the derelict fortifications of Hadrian\u2019s Wall near which Oswald fought his decisive battle against Cadwallon.<br /><br />Another particularly good feature, which could perhaps have been developed even more, is to show to what extent Oswald relied on his younger brother (and future successor) Oswiu and how the two \u201cshared the work\u201d between them. This is probably one of the main reasons that allowed the Northumbrians lead by Oswiu to conquer Goddodin and take the fortress of Edinburgh while Oswald was holding Northumbria together. It is also this \u201cdivision of labour\u201d that allowed them to repel Penda\u2019s attack on East Anglia without fear of being attacked in turn on another front by one of the other kings.<br /><br />Another good set of features are the inclusions of glossary, map, list of the main characters, a note on pronunciation and a few pages summarising the main events of Edwin\u2019s reign. I found these features particularly helpful to follow the intrigue and complex relationships and marriage alliances between the various kingdoms and pretenders to the various crowns. The little summary of the previous book is particularly helpful for anyone reading this one without the benefit of having read the first title. This allows Oswald to be read as a stand-alone book, as opposed to most series.<br /><br />I liked this book, found it an exciting read, and could not put it down. I did however have three problems the author\u2019s fictional choices. One was that I found some of them hard to believe or even bordering on the caricature. While I will refrain from elaborating too much in order to avoid spoilers, I got the impression at times that the book was about Oswald the dutiful Saint, Cadwallon the delusional, and Penda the treacherous.<br /><br />Cadwallon\u2019s portrait was particularly difficult to believe. While Cadwallon does seem to have tried to portray himself as the returning Arthur and this may have turned out to be a political blunder because it alienated other British Kings, he is shown in this book as whining, delusional and even cowardly, rather than the crafty and powerful ruler that he probably was and who over-reached, with his last gamble goinf badly wrong.<br /><br />Another point is that there is nothing to confirm Oswald\u2019s inner desire to retire from the world and become a monk, or his ascetic behaviour. There were quite a few other reasons than these for making him into a Saint shortly after his death, including his care for the poor and destitute, which seems to have been genuine. The supposed tension between Oswald and his younger brother, and the source of this tension, also seem to have been invited by the author while this is the first time I have ever heard of Penda having also a brother.<br /><br />While what happened to Oswald\u2019s body is drawn from the sources, his death may not have been caused by the elaborate and somewhat complicated plot contained in the book. A much simpler explanation was that Oswald and his followers were on a raiding expedition and got caught far from their base. Cornered and badly outnumbered, they were destroyed, which is something that happened quite frequently given the kind of warfare that was taking place at the time.<br /><br />Finally, there is again the question of numbers on each side when describing the various battles between the military households of the various warlords. Here again, the author has chosen a minimalist approach with \u201carmies\u201d in the very low hundreds at most, or even less than a hundred. While there is no way to be sure whether this is exaggerated or not, I cannot help thinking that it would be somewhat difficult to form a shield wall with only eighty warriors. Here again, however, as with the author\u2019s characterisation, this is about perceptions and personal preferences more than anything else so that I will rate this book four stars, despite slightly preferring the first volume.<br /><br />Again, for those wanting to check historical elements or learn more about Oswald on the one hand and warfare during these times on the other, I can recommend Max Adams\u2019 \u201cKing of the North\u201d, which is about much more than Oswald and also covers the reign of his uncle Edwin and Guy Halsall\u2019s \u201cWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West (450-900).", "images": [], "asin": "B010Q6E0BC", "parent_asin": "B010Q6E0BC", "user_id": "AGAYTQENQ4WNDQK6CHIVWTCP4PNQ", "timestamp": 1438420339000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Hilarious Yet Inspirational", "text": "Content wise this was another fantastic entry into the Assassination Classroom universe. It does well at giving us lots of fun and games for the students to develop them a bit more. Rather than focusing on many assassination plots, we instead get one major event while the rest focuses on development key students (like Terasaka) or enhancing our experience with their relationship with each other and with students in the main class. This is done with comedy in mind but an underlying theme of students wanting to rise from their low state and reach their full potential. It is inspirational.<br /><br />I do have to ding some points for the volume, there were about two instances of typos in the text or just weird grammar. Additionally there were no extras beyond an afterward and the usual in between chapter inserts. Though the inserts this time were quite hilarious. The slime one is probably the one that people will find most memorable.<br /><br />All in all Assassination Classroom has not lost any of its steam since its debut and is still one of the best manga in Viz's Lineup.", "images": [], "asin": "1421576120", "parent_asin": "1421576120", "user_id": "AE3MR2EVAQWHB7PZCHM2NMMVQBAQ", "timestamp": 1444178992000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Lovely voice and setting, but overly ambitious mythic influences sap character autonomy, and the book collapses. Not recommended", "text": "Captured from her father's sacked castle, Arpazia is wed to the warlord Draco and bears his child, Coria. Isolated and maddened, Arpazia abandons her daughter--but as Arpazia ages to cronehood and Coria comes of age, the two are tied together by their competing, opposing roles. Mixing the fairy tale of Snow White with the Greek myth of Persephone and early Christian liturgy, White as Snow is bursting with imagery that sometimes weaves a complex, symbolic tapestry and sometimes tangles upon itself in an excess of influence. White as Snow nails its voice and setting and is often an immersive read, but the confused symbolism and unmotivated characters hold it back from being all that it could be. In all, a disappointment and not recommended. (Terri Windling's introduction, on the other hand, is a joy to read.)<br /><br />What Lee writes best in White as Snow is the voice and setting, a combination which brings the story to life: detailed, haunting, ancient, and utterly convincing, the book is a step back in time and into another, more magical world. And so from the onset, and for its greater part, White as Snow feels like a successful book. It is certainly compelling and immersive, and only gets better when Lee introduces familiar mythic aspects: Snow White and the jealous Queen, Persephone's relationship with the seasonal cycle and the underworld, and the temptation of the deadly sins and the tree of knowledge. But as the book goes on, the convincing setting and voice are not enough: it begins to fall apart.<br /><br />The glut of symbols and myths is ambitious, but overly so: it's an excess of outside influence which doesn't always mesh together. (An example: is the queen's apple the fruit of the tree of knowledge, or a poison, or the gateway to the underworld? Though similar, these symbols are not all one and the same--and it takes more than 300 pages and two characters to unite them.) To compensate, Arpazia and Coria lack motivation, that they are better able to conform to the influences that dictate the courses of their lives. But an unmotivated protagonist rarely makes for a compelling book, and so when the characters are passive figures in the most important events (in particular, Snow White's death) the book collapses in on itself, a victim of too many symbols and not enough of its own plot or characters. I wanted to enjoy White as Snow, and for the most part the writing style and good intentions won me over. But the more I read, the more my doubts grew--and I came away disappointed. It's a good try, but not a success, and I don't recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "0312875495", "parent_asin": "0312875495", "user_id": "AFEURQMGWI3LXF5Y5SAFUT5CUMOA", "timestamp": 1244008396000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

The Reds maintain the traditional American values, it\u2019s Constitution, free markets, personal liberties and free speech.  And you know where Schlichter takes it from there.  With dripping sarcasm, he describes life in the Blue zone pretty much as it is in Venezuela and Cuba by simply extending the existing trends of today\u2019s Left.  His military background lends credibility to his protagonist, Kelly Turnbull (ex-Special Forces) who is hired, from time to time, by the USA to conduct secret missions behind enemy lines.  Turnbull turns out to be a stone-cold killing machine. So, Schlichter combines politics and action-adventure to create some pretty funny and entertaining stuff.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Overview of Christian Church History", "text": "For anyone looking for a history of how the catholic church came to be and splintered into the many denominations that now represent organized Christianity, this is a very good place to start.<br />Bruce Shelley has told the story of the Church's founding, growth, splits, doctrinal disputes, theological development and major personalities in a well organized and interesting way.  While some interesting aspects of church history may strike the reader as covered briefly, this is necessary to discuss all the major facets of a 2,000 year old institution.  Helpfully, the author includes four or five &quot;For Further Reading&quot; suggestions at the end of each chapter so those who want to plumb the depths of various topics have somewhere to go.<br />This book is scholarly without being pedantic and unbiased without being unfaithful to the centrality of Christ's life and divinity as the bedrock of all the Christian churches. From reading the text, I could not discern whether the author is a Catholic or Protestant -- he does a good job of describing their histories and conflicts without taking sides.<br />It is all here.  The early church story is described well -- a period that I have found give short shrift in other histories of the church.  The growth of the church from a spiritual movement of the outback of the Roman empire to state religion and preeminent institution is a fascinating story that is told well and succinctly.  The growth of the nation state and the resulting conflict with Christendom and the Reformation and organized religion's struggle with modernity round out the second half of the book.  Finally, the book describes current Christianity -- it's growth as a world movement in Africa and South America and some of the very recent aspects of Church Christianity in America (tele-evangelism, Billy Graham, secularization, etc.) end the book.<br />This book is a fascinating overview of Church History -- &quot;In Plain Language&quot; as advertised.", "images": [], "asin": "0849938619", "parent_asin": "0849938619", "user_id": "AF4A5EX4BKGDBE2IJJ2DGZOKCDQA", "timestamp": 1045584598000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false}

It is not the best for an exhaustive list of hotels and restaurants, but it is the best for introducing you to a local.<br /><br />This book is filled with everything that makes me love the DK guides.  There are lots of photos, good written content, great maps and fantastic illustrations of structures and even city blocks.  We have used these guides for the US, Mexico, Italy and others and they really are my first go to guide on a area.  Highly recommend them in general, and even more so for Ireland.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A time to be born, a time to die", "text": "Sally Nicholls is not a household name here in America.  She is possibly not even a name that most children's librarians, booksellers, and teachers would recognize right off the bat.  This, in spite of the fact that her previous book \"[[ASIN:0545069491 Ways To Live Forever]]\" was a stunning success.  Folks became quite fond of that story about a boy with a terminal disease, and I suppose they expected Ms. Nicholls to do more of the same.  That's the trouble with starting off your career with realism.  Move into fantasy and you'll find that the fantasy fans don't really know who you are and the realism fans are disgusted that you haven't produced more of the same.  Separate \"Season of Secrets\" from its predecessor, however, and what you have is a hearty little novel about a girl learning about the cruel war between the seasons, in the midst of her family's own personal tribulations.<br /><br />Since Molly and Hannah's mother died they've been handling it as best they could.  Their father, however, has not been handling it well.  Not a jot.  So distraught is he by the loss of his wife, in fact, that he sends his two daughters off to live with their grandparents in the country.  One night Molly is witness to a frightening vision of a man run down by a pack of dogs and a horned man on a horse.  In the ensuing days she tries to tell others, to no avail, then discovers the man in a nearby shed.  She cannot nurse or help him, but she can learn as much as she can about him and what exactly he is.  As she does, her father is drawn more and more into her life with her sister, though it takes him many tries and many mistakes before any progress can be made.  The return of her father and the eventual destruction of the man come together in such a way as to give rise to winter, and the ensuing, beautiful, spring.<br /><br />I've been reading so many books lately that don't give a fig for beautiful language.  Coming across Ms. Nicholls felt like a gulp of cool water then.  I wasn't two pages in when Molly let loose with the descriptive, \"Hannah is one and half years older than me, yet she takes up about one and a half million times more space.\"  And later, \"My dad's shirts are always stiff and clean and white; you button him up all the way to his throat and there he is, locked up safe and going nowhere.\"  I love a book that gives everyday descriptions real personality and flair.  It's the signature style of Ms. Nicholls.  It's something you can count on in every book she writes.<br /><br />And then there was an element to this title that I found simultaneously clever and frustrating.  Age.  Here we have a tale of two sisters, one older, one younger, and there's not a moment in this story when we've a clear sense of how old they are.  This is frustrating to a reviewer like myself since you judge how believable you find a character based, in large part, on whether or not they accurately act their age.  I would have thought that Molly was acting a bit young for her age at quite a few points in the story, except that for all I know Molly could be seven or she could be ten.  My suspicion is that Ms. Nicholls gave Molly a younger age, but then realized something.  If you write a middle grade novel for 9-12 year-olds and you make your heroine only eight years of age, children aren't going to want to read that story.  Truth be told, kids like to read about children that are older than themselves.  I don't care how many horned baddies you throw in there, the minute they realize that they're sympathizing with someone the age of their little brother or sister, they may abandon the novel tout suite.  The solution then would be to eliminate ages altogether.  A clever solution then, if a bit frustrating for those of us trying to get a firm grasp on whom these characters really are.<br /><br />It's such a strange novel that for a moment there you just have to wonder if this is all entirely in Molly's head.  She certainly believes that the man and the Holly King (a.k.a. the dude with the horns) are real, but might we take this book as a story that is just the wild fever dream of a girl desperately trying to recreate a strong male figure in the absence of her own father?  You can get fairly far in with this interpretation, but at some point it's just not possible anymore.  What happens here is real, to a certain extent.  For good or for ill.<br /><br />I've always had a bit of interest in books for children that are brave enough to meld religions in some fashion.  For example, there's \"[[ASIN:1416949658 The Dark Is Rising]]\" with its fingers on pagan traditions and a nod to modern Christianity (a small nod).  Better still was Pat Walsh's \"[[ASIN:0545229227 The Crowfield Curse]]\" which managed to work in Christianity, the older fairy worship of the hills, and the even older dark religions that came before.  \"Season of Secrets\" for its part is nothing so dark, but at the same time it isn't afraid to lead its child readers to the edge of some pretty huge questions.  The Man, as he is sometimes known, is a figure of rebirth in the spring.  So it is that Nicholls will have Molly first encounter his likeness in a church (an accurate detail, I have little doubt) and then later say things like, \"He looks like a curly haired Jesus\" later even speculating (but not questioning) that, \"he's sort of god, like Jesus.\" Nicholls also draws together different old English myths with skill, reminding readers that they may have seen the horned leader of The Wild Hunt not only in books like \"[[ASIN:080508049X The Black Cauldron]]\" or the aforementioned \"The Dark is Rising\" but also in stories about Woden, Odin, Herne, and even King Arthur.<br /><br />But the book that this reminded me the most of, both in terms of tone and subject matter, was David Almond's \"[[ASIN:038532653X Skellig]]\".  In one book you've a girl who tends to an injured man with the power over nature in an abandoned shed.  In the other a boy who tends to a starving man with wings in his garage.  Of course the relationship in \"Skellig\" is mildly contentious.  \"Season of Secrets\", in contrast, feels as if it is invoking the relationship between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus in \"[[ASIN:0006716873 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]\".  Not a bad comparison when you consider that in both cases you have wild nature spirits tamed, in a sense, by little British girls.  Much of this story has been seen before in some sense, but Nicholls puts her own very unique spin on the storytelling.  The result is a powerful look at love, nature, the seasons, family, and home.<br /><br />For ages 9-12.", "images": [], "asin": "054521825X", "parent_asin": "054521825X", "user_id": "AHF2B6SMLWPQ4RW7FFSHZ6YJBSCA", "timestamp": 1296524269000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

So there's that half star the book doesn't get.<br /><br />I was thinking about the difference in our reactions to the beginning of the book (daughter: &#34;what's going on? Who is she? Why do they point a gun at her? Why are the adults so mean?&#34; and me: Ooo, look what Carey is doing here by setting up Melanie as our POV character in the beginning, he can make us entirely sympathetic to Melanie and her girl-crush on her teacher Ms Justineau while at the same time give massive hints to readers familiar with the paranormal fantasy tropes of what exactly the reason is that everyone treats her like garbage and she isn't let out into the outside world) and I think its based on the fact that I am a long-time fantasy/sci fi fan and so pretty much immediately knew what was up with Melanie.<br /><br />My daughter didn't, and so the fact that the book doesn't start answering questions until about halfway through really bothered her.<br /><br />This is mostly a thriller and adventure-through-ruins-of-society kind of story. While Melanie is the main character, we mostly get her POV in the beginning long enough for us to get attached, and then we get shifting POV as she travels with Ms. Justineau, a scientist, and a few soldiers towards the city of Beacon. By the time the POV shifted, it was fine, I was already hooked to Melanie.<br /><br />Another thing that pleased me about this book was the level of science. There are medical explanations and descriptions of cool med-tech tools used in discovering those explanations for Melanie's condition that totally ring true.<br /><br />But the thing that stood out for me the most is that this book really delves into human relationships vis-a-vis the difference between the terrible creatures outside the gates, Melanie herself, Caldwell the cruel and detached scientist, and Ms. Justineau. What are the emotions that make us human? At what point is it worth saying &#34;humans&#34; deserve to live and win-out over other creatures if those humans are willing to perpetuate atrocities in order to do so?<br /><br />And what about the fierce, uncomplicated loyalty and love between mother-figure and daughter?<br /><br />Cool science, awesomely conflicted and sympathetic heroine, and a movie-worthy visual adventure.", "images": [], "asin": "0316278157", "parent_asin": "0316278157", "user_id": "AEPCSZVWVFOERFGK27XCESCFWIGA", "timestamp": 1404139250000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

She was raised to ride and shoot and live with adventure.  Soon, she realized she didn't want to be relegated to a typical female role in life.  And so she became a private investigator and has traveled all over the world in a wide variety of international business investigations.  Mostly, she works in Africa and the book is comprised of four separate stories about a few unique assignments.<br /><br />Her writing style is fast-paced, breezy and has the sense of adventure that obviously drives her life.  There's not one boring sentence in the whole book and the action never stops.  I read these stories with the kind of attention that kept me breathless and turning the pages as something new happens on every page.  And my sense of wonder at her bravery and willingness to take risks never ceased.  I just couldn't stop reading  and was sorry when this 235-page book ended.<br /><br />In the first story she investigates a mysterious death of a wealthy plantation owner.  In the second story she travels into the depths of gorilla country.  In the third story she helps a young man visit his war-torn land.  And, in the last story, she is hired to investigate a young female African doctor's disappearance.  Often, she fines herself in  personal danger and has is forced to survive in a very hostile environment.  Each one of these stories kept my eyes glued to the page.  I couldn't put the book down until they were finished.<br /><br />\"Dancing With the Witchdoctor\" was a mini-adventure for me.  It brought me to places I've only dreamed of visiting and made me identify with the author's courage, stamina and sense of adventure.  For me, reading this book was like being picked up by a whirlwind and experiencing the trip of my life.  I loved it!<br /><br />Highly recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "0060933909", "parent_asin": "0060933909", "user_id": "AFPUL5RJ5MASRADXIDPWN56OERAQ", "timestamp": 1079695922000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Little House By Boston Bay", "text": "Although not written by Ingalls, Little House By Boston Bay continues in the spirit of her books.  This time it centers on Charlotte, the grandmother of Laura Ingalls Wilder.  It is the first book in the series and starts when Charlotte is almost five years old.<br /><br />Most of the book details Charlotte's life and the almost year that it covers.  Most notably, this book takes place during the War of 1812 and so there is quite a bit of information included in there; especially a copy of the Star Spangled Banner and other songs.  Charlotte's days are filled with chores and playing with her new doll whom she has trouble naming.  She also goes to school and meets a new friend named Susan and even tries to go to Scotland (although she doesn't realize how far away it is.)  She listens to her mother's stories and helps with setting the table with her special \"Saturday Family\" (jars, bottles and etc. with condiments for the table).<br /><br />The characters in this book are mostly well written.  I do think that Charlotte, being 4-5 in this book, sounds a little too old and mature for the age.  But times were different back then so I could be wrong.  Her brothers and sisters are present but not really developed too much; the same goes for her father.  Where the characters really shine though is her mother.  Her mother is a bright personality with a lot of oomph in her and there is quite a bit of detail written about her.<br /><br />Wiley has a nice writing style and it is somewhat similar in style to Wilders.  She adds the same element of almost a diary type of writing as the other Little Houses' do, but doesn't have as much useful information within the pages.  Out of everything that is described, it is not done in a way that makes me think I could repeat it like I could with the original series.  However, there is a recipe for pounded cheese that almost seems doable by reading the description.  This is a great book for kids and reading it at my age is probably why I find more fault with it in this regards.  It is a simple story about a girl and her life.<br /><br />Not my favorite of the whole grouping of books but it wasn't bad either.  The whole series from Laura's stories, to her mothers, and so-on are a charming group of books.  They are perfect for cozying up by a fire and reading with your children, or even by yourself for reminiscing.<br /><br />Little House By Boston Bay<br />Copyright 1999<br />195 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Low Calorie Diet In Disguise", "text": "Dr. Sears's theories on different types of food and how they are processed by the body are interesting, but misguided.  Actually, people lose weight on this diet because they end up cutting calories like crazy, even past what can be considered a sane amount.  Also, there are a lot of psychological factors at play here, especially Dr. Sears's marketing skills, which are excellent.  This is one big infomercial.  I would be concerned about the long term effects of so much protein and the strain placed upon the kidneys in dealing with it.  IMHO, mindset is everything.  If you believe you will feel better, exercise more and lose weight, you will because you believe that you will.  It is not for nothing that bread is known as \"The staff of life\", and a mainstay of the human race from time immemorial.  I wonder how Dr. Sears would explain my weight loss of 15 pounds in less then 4 weeks when we were very poor and subsisting mainly on pasta and canned sauce because it was a lot of food for little money.  Ditto rice.  Throughout all this, I exercised religiously and the weight dropped off.  BTW, his insinuation about the Chinese (and Japanese) having high rates of heart attacks due to high rice consumption is ridiculous.  These two people had extremely low heart disease, body fat and breast cancer etc. for centuries subsisting on a LOT of rice, fish and vegetables.  They now have the same or higher rates of heart disease as Americans because unfortunately they have adopted the American high fat diet.  This has been proven by following Orientals who move to the US and give up their traditional diets.  Their rates of heart disease, breast cancer and diabetes soared.  Dr. Sears needs to refine his research a bit.  Another fad diet that promises the world.", "images": [], "asin": "0060391502", "parent_asin": "0060391502", "user_id": "AGOLP2OURTUMBYMYLCIXVGK42IAA", "timestamp": 1022516794000, "helpful_vote": 45, "verified_purchase": false}

I read yellow thorns which is actually the first 3 chapters of this book rather than a teaser to whet your appetite of what was to come so I did feel a little cheated here.<br /><br />Continuing on\u2026 the story had great potential. Plenty of crumbs dropped at secrets and current events in the plot that I thoroughly enjoyed. It\u2019s a typical NA bully type romance; one girl on the out and bullied by the mean girls. My heart instantly went out to Naomi but the character was strong and was able to hold her own which I enjoyed. Giving the proverbial middle finger to anyone that tries to belittle her.<br /><br />Along comes the star quarterback, the hot guy everyone wants. Whilst he had my attention; once he set his sights on Naomi it\u2019s like a switch flipped on his personality so I felt it was missing development here. Then for the next 50% of the book it\u2019s about the chase / the protests and what happens when he catches her. This I thought went on for far too long. It was unnecessary filler. Great dark, depraved raw sex but way too much. It brought nothing further to the story IMO and the plot didn\u2019t really develop and was spent solely on these two characters. Once we got past this it was back to the plot that I was invested in.<br /><br />The last 20% had me hooked and kept me invested enough to want to know the answers and what\u2019s in store for these characters.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "\"A Red Menace in Beautiful Venice!\"", "text": "I found this book on an Amazon Kindle special, and I was pleasantly surprised!  \"Red Blitz\" is the first work by James Raven I have read, and I know I shall try another.  The terrorism theme in the book is sadly becoming more and more plausible in today's world; I think if I had read this 20 years or so ago, its \"realism\" would not have been as great as it is today.  In the first few chapters, we discover that dozens of bombs have been hidden throughout Venice by a terrorist who is found dead.  But, as time quickly passes, things are not quite what they appear to be.<br /><br />The story line was good; it was not the most challenging story I've read, but it was enjoyable and kept your interest. It is more of a novella than a fully developed novel - about 150 pages, but once you get reading, the pages turn faster and faster and suddenly you are done. Still, the plot was original, and the pace certainly drove the action along. The setting of Venice is beautiful and inspired. The characterization was good, and there were some well-rounded, nicely thought out characters. The shortness of the story limited some character development which would have strengthened the book. I especially liked the central character of  Armond Cali who is the current leader of Venice paramilitary police force, known as the Carabinieri. His character did actually seem like one who could evolve in another story.  I did struggle over three or four stars due mainly to the \"shortness\" of the story; I felt that more develop in story line and character would have helped.  However, due to the gripping, innovative nature of the plot which did create a \"page turner,\" I gave it four stars.  \"Red Blitz\" is a tense \"thriller\" which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre.", "images": [], "asin": "B00AFJOA1Q", "parent_asin": "B00AFJOA1Q", "user_id": "AEYY4B2QKL3TBBXEYIO5PG7LWA4Q", "timestamp": 1412013123000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "\u201cEvery ugly toad thinks that sooner or later he is going to get to eat the meat of a swan.\u201d", "text": "Mai Jia, a popular novelist and winner of the Mao Dun Literature Prize, China\u2019s highest literary honor, writes here under a pen name after serving for seventeen years as a member of the People\u2019s Liberation Army and its intelligence services. Decoded, originally written and published for a Chinese audience in 2002, and newly translated and published in English, provides a fascinating study of cryptography and its dedicated cryptographers, many of whom give their lives (and even their sanity) to their work.  The exciting and revelatory translation by Olivia Milburn and Christopher Payne provides new insights into worlds that have been closed to most of us, not just the hidden world of cryptography and the psychological toll it takes on those who dedicate their lives to it, but also the world of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the thinking of many of its people.<br /><br />Astonishing in its focus on the travails and inner torments of one major character, Rong Jinzhen, the novel features a psychological, individualized approach, something I did not expect for characters living within the group culture of China, especially among characters from the army and its secret intelligence services. An orphan who grows up within two adoptive homes, Rong Jinzhen, known in childhood as \u201cDuckling,\u201d is a mathematical genius, called \u201cIdiot Savvy\u201d in school, but he never stops feeling isolated and apart, however praised he might be for his brilliance and dedication to intellectual goals.  He counts ants, the days that his \u201cDaddy\u201d has lived on earth before his death at age eighty-eight, invents his own multiplication tables, and becomes a chess player at the highest level of competition.<br /><br />The older and more dedicated he becomes to what he is learning, however, the more preoccupied \u2013 even autistic \u2013 he becomes.  With his lively mind focused totally on intellectual goals, he evokes our concern as he fails to make friends or find any happiness or inner peace. When he is eventually selected to work as a cryptographer for the state, he must leave behind everything he has ever known to participate at a remote and secret location on a project which will eventually consume him \u2013 the deciphering of PURPLE, the most difficult cipher ever created.  Once Rong Jinzhen (often called Zhendi by those who remember him) disappears into Unit 701, he is essentially lost to everyone else who has known him as he works to break this code for his country.<br /><br />The remainder of the novel appears in the form of interviews with two people, Master Rong, a female member of his family whom he saved during the Cultural Revolution, and Director Zheng, the man who persuaded him to join the cryptography unit.  These interviews convey Jinzhen\u2019s history and his story, but they feature much \u201ctelling about\u201d the action, instead of creating lively stories told from \u201cinside the moment.\u201d The author\u2019s use of dreams, often disorderly, reveal Jinzhen\u2019s state of mind, and a shift in style from narrative to Jinzhen\u2019s internal reveries to convey his inner turmoil in the middle section of the novel show his alarming changes. A literary novel, unique in its focus, setting, and subject matter, Decoded lives up to its title, providing exciting new insights into many aspects of life in the People\u2019s Republic of China - and if a reader also happens to be a mathematician or serious games player\u00ac, this novel will be utterly irresistible.", "images": [], "asin": "0374135800", "parent_asin": "0374135800", "user_id": "AHZZL323ORE6AHMIB2OCLYNCRXJQ", "timestamp": 1397785497000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

It's the result of the Washington Post's exhaustive coverage of the event, which employed over 100 photographers and reporters.<br /><br />It makes a nice bookend with the new New York Times book [[ASIN:1594488932 Obama: The Historic Journey]] as well as, of course, [[ASIN:B001J8ULZ6 The Audacity of Hope]].<br /><br />Big and beautiful enough to be a coffee table book, The Inauguration of Barack Obama is more than a collection of photos. Also included is a stirring foreword by Washington Post Editor-at-Large Ben Bradlee, who recalls the first inauguration he attended, of John F. Kennedy, and writes: \"This shift of power is orderly, but it's always exciting. It's the essence of democracy.\" Though the coverage of it isn't as thorough as in the Times book, Obama's story is detailed, too, from childhood through young adulthood -- when he, in his own words, burned inwardly with a \"knotted, howling assertion of self\" -- through his marriage and family life. At the back of the book is the full text of the Inaugural Address.<br /><br />I like the variety of photos. One spread shows the thousands gathered for the ceremony itself, another simply Obama's hand encircling his wife's waist on the Day of Service. A sober tribute from Obama and Biden at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery is followed by a sweet portrait of Biden holding his young grandson. My favorites are the more candid, silly shots: First lady Michelle Obama getting her gown stepped on by her husband while dancing; daughter Sasha playfully holding her hand in front of her sister Malia's camera, ruining her photo; bundled-up fans at 4 a.m. on the National Mall looking like mummies in their sleeping bags.<br /><br />The presidential seal on the dust jacket is embossed into the glossy paper.

The opening episode with the rattlesnake (also depicted on the cover of the book) is gripping, and it offers a hint that there will very likely be more elements of a thriller to come.<br /><br />Despite the positive features mentioned above, I had a rather middling response to this book.  For me, it lies somewhere between a cozy and a thriller, but from the synopsis on the back cover, I had expected a cozy.  There are no endorsements from other authors on the cover, which can offer a hint about the genre, and it took me a while to confirm that this is not a cozy.  There is excessive gore, crude language, and sex throughout, none of which in my opinion adds much at all to the story or characterization.  For readers who may be deciding whether to give this new author a try, I would say that if you like the mysteries of J. A. Jance (and I do like them myself), there's a good chance that you will like this one too. Jance's characters have more depth though; Mims doesn't give us any insight into the psychological side of Cleo Cooper's motivation.", "images": [], "asin": "0738734233", "parent_asin": "0738734233", "user_id": "AFH7WM5TULLDJQMUD6NJFSVVUBAQ", "timestamp": 1369221058000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Sustainable Ecosystems and Fire", "text": "Contrary to Smokey T. Bear, fire is an integral part of healthy ecosystems. The biggest problem with wildland fire is suppression, not burning. After a century of aggressive fire suppression and the myth of Smokey T. Bear, we now see clearly that fire is integral just as soils, sun, wind, water, insects, snow, ice and other natural processes. Put an increment borerer into a tree and you can read the fire history of an ecosystem back up to 3,000 years.<br /><br />Core into soils, meadows and adjacent streams and you can often retrace almost 10,000 years of fire history in the sediments, buried logs and stumps. Learn the behavior of wildland fire in the presence of sun, upslope wind, rain, snow, clouds, humidity, katabtic winds and air temperature and you begin to catch a glimpse of how we have artificially imposed politics, wishful thinking and pseudoscience on wildland ecosystems.<br /><br />Media and politicians speak of \"catastrophic\" and \"charred\" ecosystems, but fail to speak of the catastrophe of sprawling urban development imposed upon fire-maintained vegetation and soils. We live in wood houses with wood shake roofs and wonder why our houses burn when the surrounding air super heats.<br /><br />We have made many mistakes with fire. The first mistake is labeling wildland ecosystems uninhabited \"wilderness\". As Kat Andersen reminds us in \"Before The Wilderness,\" this was never wilderness, people have always lived here AND used fire as a tool to maintain healthy ecosystems for more than 10,000 years.<br /><br />It was the European invasion that labeled fire as \"bad\" and Disney and Bambi who drove the message home. It is only through the dedicated work of scientists and wildland managers in places like Sequoia-Kings Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone Natl Parks since 1970 that we have begun to understand the basic role of fire. The Leopold Commission in the early 1950s clearly identified the potential for large fires from all the biomass that was and continues to build up.<br /><br />There is still a large residue who label fire as \"bad,\" and don't understand the role of fire in healthy, resilant, durable ecosystems. Air Quality districts now impose their mandates on when to burn.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Impossible to categorize --or to put down", "text": "What makes you decide to read a book? It does not matter that the book was inspired by Louise Brooks but that could be intriguing enough for a start.  It is encouraging when someone like Borges- the fantasist - recommends it.  Comparisons to Philip K.Dick or Chesterton are handy, perhaps, as a hint. You may wonder how all of these very different references fit in this slim book.  But finally, when you do read it, all those references have to fall away (but perhaps not too far away) and the book must stand on its own.  Bioy Casares has created a surprising little marvel.<br /><br />Our hero is escaping the police for an unnamed capital crime, and finds himself on an island (a map is provided) decorated with three pristine buildings on the hill, but otherwise a barely hospitable place of vicious high tides, mosquitoes, swamps, reeds and misery.  As you work through this environment, Borges does come to mind, as it seems fantastic, with the imagery that seems a signature of South America genius.  You'll find yourself trying to determine whether what he describes is real or his own imaginings. After exploring every cranny of the buildings --and the descriptions remind me of art deco drawings, clean, clear, balanced but at the same time ornate-- he finds one day that the island is suddenly inhabited.  Not wanting to be discovered, he skulks around the visitors, drawn especially to the pensive and lovely Faustine and the book slips from Borges to a period mystery, a la Chesterton.  His understanding of the situation increases and it becomes more like a science fiction invention (the reference to Philip K Dick)... but still there is more, and when you realize there IS more, it becomes Casares' own novel, and stands on its own.<br /><br />It becomes a meditation on the nature of reality and our inability to separate the appearance from the nature of what is observed, the thin border between our own projections and fact, and even our willingness to consciously live in delusion. Does our hero become insane or is the answer to the mystery the whole answer, and his solution rational?<br /><br />This is a very short book, with twice the atmosphere.  It is intriguing even while it feels like it is of its own time (1925 or so). When you finish it (in a day perhaps) you may want to read it again to take the time to notice how Casares has molded so many elements into a coherent story, building dread, curiosity and solutions incredibly cleverly.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The first detective novel", "text": "THE MOONSTONE opens with the theft of a fabulous jewel from an idol in India. From this exotic location the action then goes forward in time many years to the English countryside.  The jewel, the Moonstone, has become a family heirloom soon to be presented to a young woman as a birthday present.  That very evening the Moonstone disappeared leaving behind suspicion and tragedy.  A professional detective is called in but before all is revealed there will be deaths and long hidden secrets brought to light.<br /><br />The story was originally published in the mid 1800's which can cause a problem for a modern reader.  The style of writing is much more verbose than contemporary readers are accustomed to, the vocabulary is often unfamiliar but perhaps most difficult for the modern reader are the conventions of mid Victorian society.  The class distinctions and the restrictions placed on women, particularly young, unmarried women are completely foreign to the 21st century.<br /><br />Despite these challenges THE MOONSTONE is an excellent story on its own merits.  The characters are interesting and believeable.  The plot is well thought out, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing until the very end.  For fans of detective fiction it is interesting to see the various elements of this story and recognize them from their more modern forms.<br /><br />THE MOONSTONE has been called the first detective novel.  It introduced many of the characteristics familiar to fans of this genre, the outsider, professional detective, the bumbling, incompetant local police, the clueless sidekick, the red herring clues that lead the reader astray and the premise that all clues must be available for the reader to solve the crime.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fragile", "text": "Wow, what a sweet sweet story. Fragile reminded me of A Walk to Remember and Blue Sky Days- and not just because they dealt with cancer, but because they all had beautiful writing, and even more beautiful characters that really appreciated the beauty around them. Fragile helps puts things in perspective. I enjoyed reading Fragile. It warmed my heart. Sometimes you just need to read about some great people finding each other.<br /><br />Not that Fragile is all happy-go-lucky. Not at all. The main character, Miracle, is so giving and kind. She is one of the good ones, and I am in awe of her amazing attitude. She just lets everything, and I do mean everything, roll right off her shoulders. She can always see the good in everyone. But she has serious kidney issues. This hit home with me. My grandpa has kidney problems and he has been on dialysis for years. I know how tough it is watching someone you love go through that. The saddest part, was that even though she was always fighting for other people; fighting to see the good, fighting to spread her warmth, she didn't fight too much for herself. She seemed resigned to her sickness and it just made my heart break for her.<br /><br />But even thought Miracle didn't fight for herself, Hardy continuously fought for her. That was the thing I loved most about him. He never gave up on her. I wanted to see a little bit more about the foundation for his feelings for Miracle, but on the other hand I loved seeing something so pure and strong as his love for her. It was really beautiful. Hardy is more than swoon-worthy!<br /><br />Fragile, is sweet, sad, beautiful and deep. It made me happy, melancholy, made me think and I loved every second of it. If you are a fan of realistic fiction, you need to check out Fragile.<br /><br />*Disclaimer- I got this book for free in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any compensation for my thoughts.", "images": [], "asin": "1475158378", "parent_asin": "1475158378", "user_id": "AFMXAJQ2HGQ22JZW4332OYDGQUJQ", "timestamp": 1351134067000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not the best Grisham", "text": "John Grisham has written a number of very good legal thrillers. The Appeal is not one of them. I have three reasons for my low rating.<br />1. It is too black and white. All the bad guys are uniformly bad and the good guys uniformly good. The main plot involves a chemical company dumping toxic wastes that contaminate the water supply of a small Mississippi town resulting in numerous deaths from cancer. Finally, after her husband and son die from cancer a woman sues the company. A husband and wife team prosecute the case and the jury awards the woman $41 million. Of course the company appeals and a group of sleazy political operatives arrange for a young lawyer to run for the Mississippi Supreme Court with the intention of overturning the verdict.<br /><br />2. It Is hard to tell fact from fiction. In the Author's Note Grisham admits that much of the novel is made up. At the same time some of it is factual. It is hard to tell the difference. For example Grisham cites statistics the show Mississippians to be gun-loving, religiously conservative bigots and the appellate justice system to be corruptible.<br /><br />3. The ending is unsatisfying and incomplete. The reader is left with a feeling of injustice being done. For fans of Grisham there are many of his other novels that are worth reading,", "images": [], "asin": "B003B02PFY", "parent_asin": "B003B02PFY", "user_id": "AFJPFJDJY7I3BI7LNHR5SJ456O6Q", "timestamp": 1624120241897, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I'm just not as comfortable cooking with seafood because it's much more delicate and easier to screw up.  I guess i was looking for a bunch of ways to cook shrimp on a weeknight and this is more of a fancy dinner party recipe book in my humble opinion.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love this guy's work. A national treasure of Ireland.", "text": "I've read Irish author Donal Ryan's first four books and loved them all. As for FROM A LOW AND QUIET SEA (2018), ditto. With its first three sections of fifty pages each, it seems almost like he's given us three very separate, gem-like novellas. The first presents Farouk, a British-educated doctor, who flees with his wife and small daughter from the war in Syria to the West. The second centers on Lampy, a twenty-ish young man, jilted by his lover, who lives with his unmarried mother and grandfather and is stuck in a loveless affair and a dead-end job at a local old folks home. The third concerns John, much older, reflecting back on his unscrupulous ways as a successful \"lobbyist\" and how he learned early on the advantage of a well-placed lie. All three stories are set in and around Limerick (a city Ryan knows well, as he teaches at the University there).<br /><br />These three seemingly disparate lives all come together in the most moving and unexpected ways in the closing chapters, as Ryan works his usual magic, employing an unerring understanding of human nature. Did I say I loved this book? Well I did, and I do. Donal Ryan is destined to become a national treasure of Ireland.

I haven't read any of the other stories referred to in Nameless' chronicles but will have to remedy that. I like having all the stories in one volume so I can go from one to the other.

In my doctor's waiting room I burst out into giggles and had a bunch of people look at me rather strangely, but they weren't seeing in their minds eye two of the characters hiding in a pile of pig poo. I love having the book on my Kindle Fire because I can touch a word to get the meaning, very helpful with the British slang terms used.
