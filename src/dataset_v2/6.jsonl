{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Whine and No Love", "text": "I was hoping this book would be a legitimate critique of the influence of a few wine writers like Robert Parker on the wine business.  Instead, the \"Battle for Wine and Love\" contains a narrative of Ms. Feiring's personal issues disguised as a combination autobiography and manifesto related to her job as a writer.<br /><br />The reason for not giving this book just one star, is that despite the annoying, self-indulgent nonsense, she does make one valid point.  The wine industry, including both large and small producers, are modifying their products to achieve high ratings from Parker, the Wine Spectator, and other influential publications.  As a consequence, more wines are emphasizing fruit over complexity, and the uniqueness of regional character may be falling way to a globalization of taste.  But in her discussion, she fails to recognize that wine is a product to be created, sold, and consumed.  The small producers for whom she has such affection produce wine to make a living; a fact that seems to escape the author.<br /><br />Burying this point in a sniveling diatribe that is as much about her upbringing and depressing love life (although there seems to be very little love involved)completely ruins what could have been an interesting read.<br /><br />Feiring sets up Robert Parker as some kind of evil force; but, when she interviews him she neither provides the full interview nor adequately captures the essence of it.  She makes it clear at the end of the chapter containing the interview that she really wasn't looking for a dialogue, but wanted to just tell him off.<br /><br />It is the author's self righteous tone that most diminishes the value of this book.  She claims to have a superior palate; she finds her surprisingly loyal friends to be an embarrassment; and she seems surprised why she has real difficulties with relationships.<br /><br />After completing this book, I poured a much needed glass of wine and took the time to enjoy it.  I have no idea if anyone rated it.", "images": [], "asin": "0156033267", "parent_asin": "0156033267", "user_id": "AHX52W2T4HLC5ZCYLFDCR6LSZDVQ", "timestamp": 1267032556000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good first book for those just starting the road to living debt free. Falls short for most others", "text": "Not much originality in this book to be honest. If you've read articles on debt repayment, none of what Mr. Ramsey has to say should be new to you.<br /><br />The idea of a debt snowball is ONE approach to tackling your outstanding debts. As he himself admits, it is not the most number-driven approach. Attacking the highest interest debt first makes the most sense, while the debt snowball method takes care of smaller amounts of debt offering small, quick victories. He likens it to a marathon- it is tough to go from walking less than a mile to finishing a marathon. Basically, celebrate the small victories even if it does cost you a little more in the end.<br /><br />My major problem with his approach, and many others, is the emergency fund. It is essential for a family to have a &#34;rainy day&#34; fund. Bad times will happen. It is not a matter of if, but when. Mr. Ramsey advocates saving $1000 and using the rest of your available money that is not already earmarked to tackle your debt. If you have a small, unexpected expense crop up, use your emergency fund and stop repaying the debt until you've reestablished your emergency fund. Sounds like a solid plan. It keeps you from borrowing more money when faced with life's unforeseen circumstances.<br /><br />What happens when the emergency surpasses that $1000 mark? Sure you could reduce the money you're repaying on your debt, but that assumes you will have enough to cover the expense. What if you don't? You'll be back to borrowing money, the very thing you were trying to avoid. Now, I'm not advocating amassing a huge emergency fund while your debt continues to pile up, but 1,000 seems extremely low for most families. In Mr. Ramsey's defense he does say to eventually build up your emergency fund to a 3 or 6 month reserve, but it is the in between that makes me nervous. Why not build more of your emergency fund first and then tackle the debt? That way you would have some cushion and not need to worry as much about things cropping up unexpectedly that will likely surpass a $1000 price tag.", "images": [], "asin": "0785289089", "parent_asin": "0785289089", "user_id": "AF2PPSBAI2BQZR66C2U7FS2DMIFA", "timestamp": 1460466873000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Conflicting Chapters", "text": "Hailey Dean is a top notch prosecuting attorney who has never lost a case.  She experiences \"burnout\" when her most recent case reveals a hardened killer (Clint Cruise) of 10 victims by strangulation.  He is up on a charge of an eleventh victim; however, he admits guilt (to the reader only) of the first 10 but not number 11.  Hailey prosecutes him and wins her case.  She then decides she has had enough of the dregs of society and moves to NYC from Atlanta to begin a new career as a psychologist.  Two years pass and Cruise is set free due to a political move by a corrrupt Judge looking to become Governor and following the orders of the man in charge of getting him to the Governor's mansion.  Now with Cruise out, Hailey is being followed and her patients are meeting untimely deaths.  The climax is an unexpected twist as to \"who did it.\"  I wasn't particularly crazy about the method of writing going from one storyline to another every other chapter.  The whole story regarding saving the beaches of St. Simons Island, GA was a drag and took away from the main storyline.  We do see a subtle link at the end to the main character but it seemed unnecessary to the main story.  Had Ms. Grace stuck to the murder plot and embellished on that throughout the book, I believe it would have enhanced the continuity of the story and made it a much better read.", "images": [], "asin": "1401303455", "parent_asin": "1401303455", "user_id": "AFYS3KBCPS6L5TTARMUUQM4X5ULQ", "timestamp": 1287172419000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Heyer and Austen need not worry", "text": "(Gratefully borrowed from the Greater Phoenix Digital Library, which is why this is not a verified purchase.)<br /><br />It's possible my expectations were set too high, but wow, what a letdown. Whoever wrote the book description, &#34;a novel to make Jane Austen proud and Georgette Heyer envious,&#34; had delusions of grandeur. Jude Morgan can write well, but his skills of characterization need improvement; his characters fall flat. Here's what I mean:<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS...<br /><br />First, there is no hero in the novel. Three possibilities for the role don't pass muster. One, modeled after Darcy, I suppose, is cold, haughty and reserved, all right, but his character is too disgusting to redeem. Sensing this, the author merely throws in an equally-frigid character he can win more easily. Another, whose sullenness the heroine for some unfathomable reason finds attractive, is meant to be Heathcliff-like, or Byronic, or something, but instead of charming, he comes across as pouting and angry for no clear reason. Any charming aspect of his character is too poorly conveyed by the author to be noticeable. And a third one is such a dull wooden character that I'm not at all surprised that the heroine never had a clue he felt anything at all for her. I was still debating that myself, as the novel ended.<br /><br />An attempt to include characters whose quirks can reliably amuse us is a little more successful, but the most humorous ones are near the beginning of the story and are dropped as the book progresses. One would have thought that Mrs. Lappage, for example, carefully drawn at the beginning of the novel, would play an ongoing role, but she disappears 35% into the novel. Another promising character, Miss Rose, a female Uriah Heep, is, regrettably, dropped after only a few memorable contributions to conversation.<br /><br />Caricature and subtlety do not work well together; therefore, I assume Mr. Morgan did not intend to call more attention to the quirks of Sophie, who perhaps was intended to be a less disingenuous Isabella Thorpe. Whatever his intention, Sophie is not clearly developed. Nor is her mother, whose character, I think, was supposed to be a more easily pleased Mrs. Bennet, any more fully-realized.<br /><br />Two villains in the novel also suffer from lack of character development. Suspension of disbelief for the femme fatale is especially difficult, and the couple's longterm lifestyles and machinations are not believable.<br /><br />A secondary character, sister of one of the supposed heroes, intended to be sympathetically portrayed, I think, is yet another whose personality is barely developed and whose action in the plot is lacking.<br /><br />The author's wry observations, and the graceful writing, are striking. Perhaps that makes the letdown worse. I started reading this novel wondering how I could find his other novels, since so few are in e-book format, or even in paper form in my library. Having read this novel, I am less inclined to search for any others.", "images": [], "asin": "1250038189", "parent_asin": "1250038189", "user_id": "AFICUW7LDQ23GIKDGQEISONHHKEA", "timestamp": 1532835448570, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The new social structure is in trouble  \ud83d\ude44", "text": "3.5 stars<br /><br />In Pierce Brown's 'Red Rising Trilogy' which precedes this book, humans - who had colonized the entire Solar System - were separated into caste-like Color categories. The ruling &quot;Golds&quot; were on top and the low-level &quot;Reds&quot; were on the bottom. The Reds were essentially slaves, who had short brutal lives in the underground mines of Mars. Other Color groups worked as medical personnel, soldiers, police, artists, sex workers, bureaucrats, household help, and so on.<br /><br />The original trilogy revolves around Darrow, who was born a Red. After being surgically transformed to look like a Gold, Darrow infiltrated Gold society and - after rising through the ranks - became known as Darrow au Andromedus of Lykos.<br /><br />Darrow eventually led a revolution that overthrew Gold rule. This led to the establishment of a democracy that would (theoretically) allow all Color groups to have equal rights. Thus, at the end of the trilogy I thought things in the Solar System were running down the right track.<br /><br />NOT SO FAST!!<br /><br />In 'Iron Gold' - the first book of Pierce Brown's new series -it's ten years after the revolution. A Solar Republic has been established, with an 'all Color' Senate on Luna (Earth's moon). The Senate debates and enacts legislation, with input from all sides. The head of the Senate, and elected Sovereign of the Republic, is Virginia au Augustus - a Gold who happens to be Darrow's wife. Darrow is the military leader of the Republic, and he's in big trouble.<br /><br />After the revolution, Gold factions retained control of Mercury, Venus, and the Outer Rim. The Golds hate Darrow, whom they consider a Red usurper, and call him the 'Slave King.'<br /><br />To wrest control of Mercury from the Golds, Darrow unleashed a massive bombing attack on the small planet - called an 'Iron Rain.' This was successful, but resulted in immeasurable damage and cost hundreds of millions of lives. The Senate didn't give permission for the Iron Rain and plans to put Darrow on trial. However, Darrow has no intention of allowing this to happen.<br /><br />To further peace in the Solar System, Darrow feels compelled to free Venus, which is under the thumb of Gold leader Magnus au Grimmus, also known as the Ash Lord. Darrow plans to kill the Ash Lord, a feat that's almost impossible since Magnus never leaves his impregnable fortress home.<br /><br />Darrow devises a complex plan to slay the Ash Lord, but he must first escape from Luna with his most loyal supporters.....leaving his wife and their son Pax behind. Darrow is torn between his duties as a warrior and his responsibilities as a husband and father, and this haunts him throughout the novel.<br /><br />Though Darrow is an important protagonist in this new series, other characters also take center stage. These include:<br /><br />Ephraim ti Horn, a Gray who fought for the revolution, but became disillusioned after his husband was brutally murdered. Grief-stricken and angry, Ephraim left the military to become a professional thief. Ephraim recruited a small group of helpers, and now accepts commissions to steal specific items such as artworks, weapons, and so on. When a vicious crime lord hires Ephraim to steal some very valuable commodities, big trouble ensues.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Lyria of Lagalos, an 18-year-old Red girl who was liberated from the Martian mines after the rebellion. Lyria and her extended family were placed in a refugee camp on the surface of the planet, and promised assistance from the Republic. The administration didn't come through, however, and Lyria lost most of her family to a terrorist attack.<br /><br />When the government finally sends troops to Mars, Lyria rescues an injured Gold warrior named Kavax au Telemanus from drowning. The wealthy man repays Lyria by taking her into his household on Luna, where she works as a servant. Uneducated, na\u00efve, and lonely, Lyria falls under the influence of a dapper, charming older man. Once again, this leads to trouble.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Lysander au Lune, a 20-year-old Gold who's the grandson of Octavia au Lune - the Sovereign who ruled the Empire before the rebellion. After his grandmother was killed, Lysander was taken under the wing of Cassius au Bellona - a Gold who was once Darrow's friend....but is now his mortal enemy.<br /><br />As Lysander and Cassius are wandering around the Solar System in their armored craft they come upon a stranded ship in deep space. This leads to the rescue of a young Gold woman named Seraphina au Raa, who's the daughter of Romulus au Raa - leader of the Outer Rim. As a result, Lysander and Cassius - instead of being thanked - are made prisoners of Seraphina's mother, the merciless Dido au Raa.<br /><br />Lysander and Cassius learn that Dido is planning a massive attack on the inner planets, to try to re-establish Gold rule. The newcomers can either assist with the assault.....or face the consequences. Tough call!<br /><br />*****<br /><br />The book is chock full of clever tactics, stealthy maneuvers, and deadly battles, and the characters have all manner of futuristic weapons and protective armor - which I picture as flexible 'Iron Man' suits. Pierce Brown populates the book with a large array of characters, including several favorites from the Red Rising Trilogy, such as: Sevro au Barca (Darrow's best friend); Victra au Barca (Sevro's wife); Dancer (Darrow's former mentor, now a powerful Senator); Kieran (Darrow's brother); Rhonna (Darrow's niece); and more.<br /><br />The author wisely includes a list of characters at the beginning of the book, with thumbnail descriptions, which I found very useful. Pierce Brown also provides a map of the Solar System, with the location of the various factions, which helped me orient myself in the Solar Republic.<br /><br />For me, 'Iron Gold' didn't stir the same positive emotions as the original trilogy. In the first three books I cheered on the abused Reds who were struggling for freedom and equality. In this new trilogy, the narcissistic, entitled Golds are scheming to re-take (what they think is ) their rightful place in society.....and I'm not on board for that.<br /><br />I almost wish Pierce Brown had just started a new series that takes place in a different world with new characters.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the story is well-written, exciting, and suspenseful, and I recommend it to fans of science fiction/adventure tales. The book could be read as a standalone, but for maximum pleasure it's best to read the Red Rising Trilogy first.", "images": [], "asin": "042528591X", "parent_asin": "042528591X", "user_id": "AHNZRQNJHNSBVKERNXSWNLKOZ6YQ", "timestamp": 1525734382667, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Lovely, likeable", "text": "THIS IS AN EDIT OF THE ORIGINAL REVIEW:  APOLOGY TO ALL WHO READ THE ORIGINIAL REVIEW: SHOULD HAVE PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS!  This may be the most expensive book and horrible time-waster I've ever seen. I was so excited when first getting the book with such great outfits, I didn't pay enough attention to the back of the book with the \"patterns\". Just saw the sturdy paper there and planned on copying on printer.. Big mistake. The \"full-sized patterns\" are a horror.The patterns are on 20\" x 30\" paper, laid out to conserve space, and impossible to fit onto a printer. The pattern pieces are arranged so poorly that you'll be lucky to get 2 pieces on an 8x12 sheet of paper. Many of them are too large even for that and must be pieced together for the full size. There are 98 pieces --it will take a full cartridge to print them. Plastic sheets for the pieces? $$$. Transfer paper? probably 40-50 sheets. The best description I can give to the way the patterns were done is: CHEAP,CHINCY,DUMB. ORIGINAL REVIEW:  First-had ordered the book, Doll Fashion Studio: Sew 20 Seasonal Outfits for Your 18-Inch Doll, from another seller for a slightly lower price, but it was backordered for 6-8 weeks. Amazon to the rescue--ordered,Prime, and a few days later, it was on my doorstep. Instant love. Yes, it does have 1 drawback, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. The patterns are printed on both sides of the pages, but it's such a minor annoyance, you'll forgive Joan Hinds. Also, I plan on making templates of the pattern pieces, so tracing them out won't bother me a bit. You'll really like the fact that the pattern pieces are on sturdy paper at the back of the book. You'll be able to utilize the instuctions (really liberal with pictures of all the pieces) without leaving the instruction pages for the outfit. The book also answered another question I've been trying to decide on what to craft for St. Jude and other children's charities. It has several projects which will be great for dolls, but can also be adapted for little ones undergoing treatment. Just wish I could have afforded the DVD. Hope everyone will have as much fun as I plan to have with this great book.

That being said, this book is kind of a let down after that.  While it was still well written for children and does envelop the horse culture that is Chincoteague, the story almost seems incomplete and not very fleshed out.<br /><br />Its the next Pony Penning day at Chinconteague and before all the wild ponies of Assateague can be driven over to the island, Paul and Maureen are approached by some movie makers wanting to buy Misty, their pony they had gotten the year before.  Misty is beloved to them and they have a hard time letting her go, but need the money to send their uncle to college and also think other children should be able to experience the wonderfulness that is Misty.  With the emptiness that fills their hearts after letting her go, they need to find something to ease the pain.  Luckily, they find an orphaned foal whom they call Sea Star and claim him for their very own.  He doesn't want to eat however, and is not thriving very well. Maureen and Paul have to find a way to save him.<br /><br />The characters in this book are not as fleshed out.  Although they are the same as from the previous books, they just don't have as much warmth to them and even Grandpa Beebe seems a little less cheerful.  Grandma Beebe gets a few more lines in this book which was nice to see, but still remains a minor character.  The book mostly focuses on Paul and Maureen but they are often doing things rather than experiencing them and showing emotion (the exception being when they make the decision to sell Misty).<br /><br />This book is still very well written for kids.  Most of it is easy to read and understand and has a simplicity that even the younger ages can handle.  There isn't anything offensive in this book and it is appropriate for all ages.  I do find some flaws in the writing though, although a lot happens in this book there is scant description and the ending seemed incomplete.  Another fifty pages or so would definitely help the book and bring the story along more.<br /><br />It was an ok book, just not as good as some of Henry's others.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Highly Imaginative", "text": "I chose to read From a Buick 8 by Stephen King as a Lovecraftian read. I had heard mixed opinions about the novel. Some people hated it, and other people felt it is very underrated, overlooked, and deserves more credit. In other words they love it. I have to say I am a bit torn as to my opinion, but maybe my review can shed some light.<br /><br />From a Buick 8 is a story that focuses on the son of a deceased Pennsylvania State Trooper, and a mysterious Buick Roadmaster that shows up in their town. Ned is the son of the late Trooper Curtis Wilcox, and the men and women of Troop D decide to sit down and talk with Ned. The aged Troopers tell Ned a tale that leaves him with more questions. Will their complete story answer questions from days gone by? Will the Buick\u2019s mysteries be revealed? Will more death ensue?<br /><br />I love King\u2019s writing, and of course his story telling and descriptiveness is amazing. From a Buick 8 is a book I feel may grow on you in time. I really enjoyed the telling of the story that spanned from the late 70\u2019s to 2001. It was also interesting how it was told by the older Troop D Troopers. A lot of the descriptions require a lot of imagination. (When it comes to the Buick). I am also torn by the ending.<br /><br />Overall I give From a Buick 8 by Stephen King three and a half stars out of five stars. I really enjoyed the book, but it wasn\u2019t my absolute favorite. It definitely is a book that makes you think, and use your imagination. There was an issue I saw where King said in one chapter that Curt was the one Trooper who didn\u2019t Smoke when they went to the diner. Then a few chapters later it said his wife nagged him to quit smoking for years. That bothered me. I also felt a little bummed at the end outcome even though the journey was fantastic.

If you don't have a live model or photo reference, you can use this book to look up a variety of poses from a wide variety of angles (front, back, 3/4, high, low, etc.).<br /><br />The author provided many reference illustrations: mannequins and parts of mannequins from different angles and anatomy labels for the ear, hand, foot, a full skeleton, and major muscles. He described in step-by-step detail how to draw a head, hand, and foot. He also described in a generalized, &#34;it'll be about here&#34; way how different angles affect the apparent placement or size of various features.<br /><br />The author assumed a certain amount of previous experience in drawing figures. For example: in his first section, he explained perspective and how to draw a box in perspective. He then gave a two-step lesson: (1) a rotated box viewed from low perspective (2) a fully rendered figure in that box. I was hoping for help in drawing a mannequin correctly into that perspective box or through using perspective lines. That help is never provided beyond a few, brief tips.<br /><br />The mannequins were all super-hero types (skinny women or muscled men) and many of the references were from extreme angles or of exaggerated movements.

Ronnie's girlfriend, Tracy, tells Detective Inspector John Rebus that Ronnie was distraught before he died, and repeatedly cried &quot;hide, hide.&quot; At first it looks like Ronnie overdosed, but Rebus learns that Ronnie's dope was tainted with rat poison.<br /><br />Because Rebus is involved in a drug case his boss, Superintendent Watson, invites the detective to lunch with a few Edinburgh bigwigs who are involved with an anti-drug campaign. Rebus seems to be of interest to these rich, successful men, who invite him to a classy party and give him an 'honorary membership' in a gambling club.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tracy reports that she's being followed, and Rebus notices that he's being followed as well. It's clear that someone is interested in Rebus's investigation, and he has to find out why. To assist with his inquiries, Rebus reaches out to Sergeant Brian Holmes - the cop least likely to complain about Rebus's numerous demands.<br /><br />It turns out that Ronnie was a threat to some people; Tracy knows more than she's telling; and Edinburgh's upper crust citizens have dark secrets. Some side plots in the story involve illegal dog fights, a gay character, and Rebus's ex-lover - Gillian Templer - who has a new radio DJ boyfriend. Rebus pines for Gillian and wants her back.<br /><br />The book gets over-convoluted and some plot points don't make sense. Still, Rebus has good intuition and identifies the criminals in the end.<br /><br />This is an early book in the Rebus series and he's kind of 'Rebus light.'

If you want to know more about how that process works, try reading the original screenplay and see how it served as the blueprint for what followed.<br /><br />The novel may be great in its own right.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing historical fiction read", "text": "I could not get into any type of good reading groove with this one. The beginning was confusing to the point in which I had to read the publisher's synopsis to figure out what was even going on. Then a little bit of the backstory is introduced about the two sisters and I start getting my hopes up. But that was short lived and I just never felt fully invested in the characters or the story. I think this is a case of a book just not being the right fit for me.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1912 and from my understanding of the Author's Note this book is a work of fiction but the writer did draw some inspiration from real life events and people. This book can be placed in the historical fiction genre but much of it is the product of the author's creativity and imagination. Thea and Kay are half-sisters and there is a bit of an age gap between the two of them. After their father died, Thea put her plans of marriage on hold to relocate and raise her younger sister. Now ten years later, Thea is recently married to the captain of the Morning Light ship. The newlyweds and Kay set off for a lengthy voyage.<br /><br />I felt like I was able to better understand after reading the Author's Note what she was going for in the book and I appreciate the attempt to bring something different to the historical fiction genre. Unfortunately I had a hard time with the actual execution and had a bit of a choppy reading experience. Early on I felt like it was setup for me to care about the two sisters, but ultimately I just didn't, especially in regards to Kay.<br /><br />Judging by some of the other early reviews, either the story hits home with you or it is a complete miss.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice small-town setting, noncredible protagonist and denouement", "text": "Samuel Craddock, chief of police in Jarrett Creek, Texas, is missing the wonderful baked goods his neighbor Loretta Singletary often brings over to delight his taste buds, but he becomes very alarmed when her other friends reports she has disappeared. His concern grows when he discovers she has been using an online dating site to meet men, and a full-scale investigation by Craddock and his deputy Maria Trevino ensues. Then another middle-aged woman disappears in a neighboring town under similar circumstances. With all of this going on, Craddock does NOT need the distraction of trying to referee a challenge to the local Catholic  church\u2019s control of the popular annual goat rodeo by the new Baptist minister.<br />After the reader is introduced to the issues the chief faces, the book turns into a fairly straightforward police procedural made more interesting by the glimpses of small-town life and characters. I was almost immediately put off, though, by the way the character of Craddock was portrayed. He comes across as quite the country bumpkin, who has almost no idea what online dating is about and does not even know enough to Google to find information.  He is not a Millennial, by any means, but he was police chief previously and then a successful businessman in the oil field before returning to Jarrett Creek. It is not believable to me that he would not have more expertise with computers than is described. To strain credibility further, this same man then sits down at Loretta\u2019s computer and looks at the history of her searches before she disappeared. Where did that more sophisticated expertise come from? He is not much more believable when it comes to police procedure. When he comes out of his house and sees that someone has apparently broken into Loretta\u2019s house, he runs to the house without apparently taking his gun. And when the police from a neighboring town tell him another woman has disappeared, he does not even think to ask the woman\u2019s name (nor does the other police officer think to give it to him).<br />After this it was not surprising to me that the denouement came from left field and had some big unexplained aspects to it, including just how Loretta was captured and successfully held captive.<br />I had read the first book in this series and enjoyed the atmosphere of the small Texas town. It was easy to pick up the context---it was no surprise that Samuel Craddock is now chief of police, and I think this is a series that readers need not read in order. If you enjoy small-town atmosphere and are not too picky about flaws in plot or character, you might like to visit the folks of Jarrett Creek, Texas.

I made it for about a 100 pages and hit my limit.<br /><br />I rarely understand the need to jump back and forth over time. To what end? I don't mind being challenged to keep track of a narrative thread, but it has to be done for good reason. It takes a special book and a special reason in the hands of a very competent author to pull this off and pull it off well. Even in those cases if I were the editor I would ask, \"why are you choosing to tell the story out of order?\"<br /><br />The additional challenge for Kushner was to build points of view through the eyes of two young children. The challenge, as always with young adults or old children, is choosing a vocabulary and awareness that truly matches that perspective. It would be helpful if it were an adult recalling what he or she thought as a young teenager, for instance, but Kushner never suggests that it's anything but the youngster's point of view.  Coupled with relatively flat and dispassionate writing, the result is a challenging narrative to swallow.  A sample: \"Maybe we should have seen it coming. It takes a while to put thing together. You can't always do it while it's happening to you. A week before the fire started, the rebels closed down the main highway east to Las Tunas. That meant they had control of Oriente, so much of which was owned by Americans. Us, and the American government, who ran the Nicaro nickel mine. Batista was persona non grata with the Cubans and we were caught in the middle. Fidel and Raul, these were local boys, and I think Daddy was hoping he could reason with them. But after the embargo on U.S. sales of military planes to Cuba, that was in March of '57, Batista put pressure on Daddy to convince John Foster Dulles--Mr. Dulles was a friend of Daddy's and a stockholder and his brother Allen was on the company's board--to find a loophole to get a sale of bombers through.\"<br /><br />I know kids are smart and put lots of information together (I've got two teenagers), but this kind of info dump back-story being told by a young person didn't connect.  I wasn't sold.<br /><br />The writing is detailed and the atmosphere is certainly evocative of Cuba, although I've never been there, but I wish the character believability and the plot matched the setting.", "images": [], "asin": "141656103X", "parent_asin": "141656103X", "user_id": "AEYFCXNFRVL5ISYTH7AO2CZH4WZQ", "timestamp": 1230406896000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Random action, unlikeable characters, never gets to the point...", "text": "The biggest fault I had with this book was that it took almost the entire 500+ pages to truly (I think) start the story.  The rest is about the meanderings (well ok, battle filled meanderings) of characters from a wide variety of areas.  Probably the best comparison I can make is with \"Fellowship of the Ring\" by Tolkien.  Both books involve a quest that is a major turning point in the characters' lives and the world (I assume so anyhow for \"The First Law\" series, not having read the latter two books).  But whereas \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" places the start of the quest relatively early but after a buildup which makes the necessity and gravity of the quest apparent, \"The Blade Itself\" waits til the end and the quest appears to come out of nowhere with no indication as to why it's important.<br /><br />The rest of the book comes across as a weak \"Song of Fire and Ice\" clone, with sections focusing on different characters from different political entities but none of these sections really grabbed me or made me care about what might happen to the characters.  One is a bitter, crippled torturer.  One is a pampered, spoiled, lovesick noble.  One is a barbarian well known for his abilities in battle (I'll admit, this character did provide a rather well done plot twist at one point).  One is a wizard who has an ulterior motive.  Etc... The different political factions fight against each other, but I rarely got a sense as to why certain things were done.  Battle scenes were thrown in pretty much at any opportunity.  One of the characters is training for a contest, and those scenes seem nothing more than some medieval version of \"Rocky\".<br /><br />The upshot is that for me, this novel was a slow read, punctuated by somewhat random (if reasonably well written) battle sequences, peopled by characters I couldn't empathize with, in a world with somewhat simplistic connections between the different factions, and left me just as confused as to where things were going at the end than at the beginning.<br /><br />To be clear, I don't need to be hand-held when reading.  I don't mind a bit of mystery, or surprising changes of direction.  But for a change of direction to be surprising, there has to have been another solid seeming direction beforehand, and I never got this impression when reading.<br /><br />I also didn't feel like I'd wasted my time after reading it, but it failed at its task of getting me interested enough to buy the next novel.", "images": [], "asin": "159102594X", "parent_asin": "159102594X", "user_id": "AG6ZZLTMTLBPX7M42WP2VCD32NWQ", "timestamp": 1229022261000, "helpful_vote": 28, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Curiosity-Inducing", "text": "THREE QUICK POINTS<br />* Point 1: A bit chilling. At least, the beginning was. What would you do if some creepy dark creature offered to eat your fears?<br /><br />* Point 2: Mmmm, cheesy clich\u00e9 filling. The entire middle section of the book is devoted more to shock value than fear factor.<br /><br />* Point 3: The end is curiosity inducing. If I didn't know better, I'd say I'd been devoured because I'm anxious to read the next installment.<br /><br />SHORT SYNOPSIS<br />When her mother ups and leaves, Regina must help take care of her younger brother Henry while their father runs his construction business. Reggie, along with her best friend Aaron, is an avid reader and horror fan. One of her rituals with Henry is to read him scary bedtime stories, the most recent of which is from the journal of a seemingly crazy woman where she talks about frightening creatures called Vours. On a lark, Reggie and Aaron decide they're going to summon a Vour. Of course, they don't really expect anything to happen, but something does--to Henry--and it's up to them to solve the mystery and save Reggie's little brother.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br />Some parts were good, and some parts were lame, but something must have been done right because I have a burning desire to read the next book.<br /><br />The story unfolded well; the process of Henry's devouring was downright chilling (that makes up the first quarter of the book). I was hoping the momentum would continue, but it petered out and the story became something straight out of a B horror movie.<br /><br />Although Henry is acting differently (like people and pets dropping dead in his presence), neither Reggie nor Aaron wonder whether he's possessed until well after any clear thinking person would have. But I was willing to forgive that.<br /><br />What I had difficulty forgiving was the gore-for-scare effect filling out the story, some of the dialogue was pure cheesy clich\u00e9, and character development left much to be desired.<br /><br />Call me jaded, but anyone who's ever watched more than a few classic horror movies would see right through it--in fact, I laughed a couple times. I truly wish it had more of the creepy ominous psychologically frightening effect displayed in the beginning (that section should not be read at night or in the dark), but if wishes were pennies, I'd be a millionaire.<br /><br />What has my panties in a bunch, though, is the fact that I really, really want to read the next book. The Devouring ended at the beginning of a bigger mystery. It's not to say that The Devouring wasn't a full story in and of itself--it was, thank goodness--but the story left me wondering: Who is Eben really? What are the Vours? And what is their ultimate plot? (Which is what a good series style book ought to do.)<br /><br />That's why this book was so difficult to rate. On one hand, a chunk of the story I would consider lame in the horror department, relying more on clich\u00e9d gore than suspenseful gore, but on the other hand, it did an amazing job of painting a larger story, piquing curiosity, and it *was* a fun read. So I'll just say this: if you're a fan of horror and have read/watched many horror novels/movies, you won't find too many surprises here, but the mystery of the Vours is great.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7gDIOwzL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7gDIOwzL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7gDIOwzL._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "031602712X", "parent_asin": "031602712X", "user_id": "AGHVMWDAR6SUDKW2DI373YCDG7NA", "timestamp": 1274413270000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Doesn't Gallop, Canter or Trot", "text": "\"The Yonnahlossee Riding Camp for Girls,\" Anton Disclafani's debut novel could have been much more impressive if it had engaged the reader with more of a sharp bit between the teeth persistence in its opening 100 pages.  Instead of packing a walloping punch, immediately exploring main character Thea's fall from grace, Disclafani relies on a gentler more meandering telling, using a \"girl and their ponies\" technique that seems innocuous but hides a sad and willful maturity that almost coldly defines her adolescent's natural fifteen-year-old self-absorption.<br /><br />Told in the first person, \"RIding Camp\" voices the first person experience of Thea Atwell after she is banished by her family-Florida citrus growers during the Depression Era to atone for her sins at an equestrian camp for girls, an odd punishment for someone who simply adores horses.<br /><br />Perhaps, as we learn that Thea and her brother Sam are virtually isolated, prowling about their 1000 acre property without supervision or any other society, Thea's \"imprisonment\" at the school/camp entails that she adjust quickly to the company of girls her own age, if not of her own social standing. No longer is she the reigning queen of her domain.<br /><br />The author takes her time, describing the camp and its inhabitants with the kind of stereotypical detail a young fifteen year old might use to categorize her competition.  Unfortunately for this reviewer, the overly lush depictions of the camp and its denizens although nicely accomplished from its adolescent vantage point fail to kindle enough interest to keep me thoroughly absorbed. Even though I could not wait to discover the big secret, the everyday activities of camp/school life did little to entertain me along the way.  The eventual reveal presents an event already guessed; the narrator defined as someone to which I do not wish to relate whose actions I cannot condone.<br /><br />What Disclafani achieves is a perfect portrait of an amoral young girl from her own part juvenile, part world weary perspective which, as it should, bounds about to eventually disclose the entire story from the priority standpoint of a fifteen year old.  Nevertheless, the ultimate effect it elicits for me is one of apathy, despite the wonderful prose, and the flawed untrustworthy main character.<br /><br />For some reason--perhaps the blurb promising this book to be the \"read of the summer,\" elevated my expectations to the standard of Donna Tartt's [[ASIN:1400031702 The Secret History]], another novel of secrets and boarding schools.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Those reading \"The Yonahlossee Riding Camp For Girls\" should add a star if they spent their own adolescence riding and loving horses.  For those who have not, this coming-of-age tale does not engage as rapidly as it should despite the lovely descriptions and depictions of the usual suspects in a boarding-school scenario.  Thea, the main character, is complex but not altogether likable which makes recommending this novel iffy at most.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\"reneofc\"", "images": [], "asin": "1594486409", "parent_asin": "1594486409", "user_id": "AHMSKOYKE32N5P6E7AK7PQXGPA7A", "timestamp": 1370309954000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

I really did. I wanted to like it. An unknown-to-me author selling a book at the fantastic Tucson Festival of Books by an independent dealer; what's not to like?<br /><br />Where should I start? If you like adjectives and adverbs, this is your book! Clearly, Mr. Malory has not taken Stephen King's writing advice to purge every possible adverb from your writing. It's silly (and lazy) to use an adverb when your prose should better describe what's going on.<br /><br />Every descriptive list, and there's a lot of them, has three items; not two, not four, three. Boring! Mix it up a little. Not every describable entity has three properties. Some have none at all!<br /><br />Our author describes our hero in innumerable ways, each one more clever than the last. Or perhaps that is what he would like you to think. I just found it fatiguing. What's wrong with calling our hero \"Rick\" or \"him\"? Using emotive descriptions each time he's referenced is amateurish.<br /><br />So in this story, Rick Archer is something of a child prodigy, easily taking up mechanical principles and applying them to all manner of fascinating things a child's curiosity wanders into. He grows up in an eventually broken household, breezes through his technical training in the conscripted military, does equally well in tech school, lands a wonderful job in the aviation industry, and meets an unbelievably super girl. (Do you want more adjectives and adverbs? Get the book, now!)<br /><br />By the time I got to the chapter entitled \"So This Is Hell!!!\" I thought I really was in the aforementioned locale and just couldn't take it anymore. Sorry, Mr. Malory, but you beat me. I'm not sure that was your intention, but you did it.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Making Sounds for the Movies", "text": "It is sometimes said that sound makes up half a movie or video. I'm not certain what the proportions are, but Kahra Scott-James and I agree that sound can make or break a moving image.<br /><br />This book begins with a history of the use of sound in movies and videos, including experimental works. Scott-James then proceeds to discuss the use of sound before, during and after production. Her examination is of the process involved rather than on the techniques of creating sound, with a major emphasis upon animation (which has significant differences from the live action process). The milieu she looks at is major productions that can afford producers, directors, cinematographers, and with regard to sound, sound designers, composers, editors, mixers and so forth. Nothing is aimed at the lone wolf videographer, although a few ideas can be derived from the multi-staffed productions.<br /><br />The book does not go into technical details, like how to mic a performer or operate a digital audio workstation, but that's not surprising. Given the wide variety of equipment that's available for both recording and editing, the reader should only expect to get that kind of information in a dedicated book. On the other hand, it would have been nice to have further exploration of what I consider the aesthetic aspects of sound; for example, what levels of detail in the sound matrix might best support a particular genre. (I've seen few texts that actually do this, and then only in the most general way. The aesthetic aspects seem to require a critique of actual work rather than a lesson.)<br /><br />There is a companion website, although the URL given only yields an error. I had to search the publisher's web site, using the author's name, to find the page. Ultimately, it mostly provided the names of a few full-length motion pictures recommended by the author. It's too bad the companion site wasn't full of clips that could have played sound and video to make the author's points.<br /><br />The book is aimed primarily at narrative fiction, with little mention of documentary or other types of filmmaking. The history of sound in movies and video was much longer then needed and seemed more like a separate academic treatise.  Picking a nit, the book had many long quotes of a kind usually indicated by set-ins or a different typeface that could only be distinguished from the main text by a citation at the end.<br /><br />If one has never read a book on the process of creating sound for movies or video this book will do. Otherwise, filmmakers will not discover anything new.", "images": [], "asin": "1474235115", "parent_asin": "1474235115", "user_id": "AG5PK25GTSF3Z5KDP2464Y7Z4J3Q", "timestamp": 1573601231777, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

I kept hoping Tess would develop more about this unusual sword and where it got it's power, but she just sort of drops the subject. I thought it was strange the characters weren't more curious about the sword's power. I know I would be!<br />The main character is a woman named Jix.

During this time, Jix and Jamie are &quot;guests&quot; in a castle run by a man that wants his son married off. You guessed it. Jix must marry him, or the sword won't be returned to her. No fireworks fly between Griffin and Jix. Jamie and Jix play cat-and-mouse with thier real feelings. There is a tiny side plot where Jamie must rustle some cattle and nearly gets killed, but I never felt any real suspense.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Taliesin", "text": "I really like Arthurian legends.  And this one was supposed to be a good one.  In some ways it was, and in other ways I did not enjoy the book at all.<br /><br />This goes way back in the Arthurian legends to tell the tale of Merlin's parents.  The beautiful strong Charis of Atlantis.  And Taliesin, the enchanting druid bard who is son of a king.  The book divides its time between the two and their families, telling of their early years.  For Charis, this is the start of a war for her nation, her time spent as a bull dancer, and the fall of Atlantis.  For Taliesin, his tale shows the meeting of his parents, his training as a druid, and how he meets Charis.  Charis especially meets with a lot of hardship and her story is the more interesting of the two.  Taliesin seems to live a charmed life and is thought of as lucky and fortune favored.<br /><br />The characters were well written.  They had a lot of depth to them and Lawhead took the time to give them a full history.  Charis is written as cold but capable.  Taliesin is charming.  There are many other characters that are all essential to the book.  My only complaint about the characters is that Lawhead made the Christians perfect in action and the pagans somewhat evil at times.  It was a little disconcerting to find that in what I thought was a fantasy novel rather than a religious work.<br /><br />Lawhead is very descriptive.  He gives an engaging plot and does a wonderful fantasy telling of the earlier parts in the Arthurian legends.  He makes his characters mostly believable and especially in Charis' case, you want to know what is going to happen to them and care about them as a character.  Nothing is overtly offensive in the wording and there isn't a lot of harsh language.<br /><br />Let me touch on some criticisms however.  As stated before Christianity is considered very good in this book.  Lawhead took it to the point where it felt very preachy to me.  I don't care that a writer reflects his religion in his works, but please don't announce it as the be all end all of religion because that can be offensive to some readers with different beliefs.  In this Arthurian legend especially, where a lot of paganism is involved, it is very disconcerting to read a book that expresses the beliefs this way instead of being a fabulous work of fantasy.  Also, for the purists who read this, the timeline seems a bit strange.  For most, Atlantis takes place hundreds if not thousands of years before the time of Arthur and even though this is a couple generations back from Arthur, it still seems to be too close.  There are some other historical data that doesn't quite sync up with normal Arthurian tales as well.  While it is a fantasy tale, there are some genres like the Arthurian legends, where are you taking a risk by deviating well accepted norms within the genre.  I think Lawhead dances a very fine dance on the line with these aspects.  Overall though, these things brought the book down a bit for me and really were a disappointment.<br /><br />I have the next book in the series so I will be continuing on.  I can only hope they improve and become less preachy and truer to the Arthurian legend.<br /><br />Taliesin<br />Copyright 1987<br />452 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good story about cops vs. a sociopathic serial killer", "text": "In this fourth book in the series, Detective Chief Inspector Erika Foster's big mouth and abrasive attitude have got her booted off Lewisham's Murder Investigation Team (MIT) and stuck with a boring desk job. When the horribly battered body of a half-naked young woman is found in a London dumpster, Erika - on her own initiative - connects the killing to another murder a few months before. Desperate to get back on the MIT and investigate the appalling crimes, Erika is willing to do almost anything - even apologize to her nemesis, Superintendent Sparks.<br /><br />Before long Erika is the Senior Investigative Officer in the cases of the murdered girls, working with her usual team, including Peterson, Moss, and Crane. Erika thinks a serial killer is at work, and she's proven right when a third body turns up in a dumpster. The top brass at Scotland Yard, fearing bad publicity and public backlash, put pressure on Erika to catch the perp - but budget constraints limit the resources assigned to her.<br /><br />We learn that the killer is a short, pudgy office worker who resents the fact that attractive women won't look at him twice. Wanting revenge against women, the killer repeatedly creates fake profiles on social media to 'catfish' a pretty brunette and lure her into meeting him. He then kidnaps, cages, tortures, and murders the victim. When a not-so-attractive woman - the perp's awkward co-worker - invites him to a movie, he can barely stand to be with her.....which is pretty ironic.<br /><br />The story alternates between the police investigation and the killer's activities. The description of the perp's step-by-step method of tracking, luring, and torturing his victims ratchet up the tension, and I had to take periodic breaks from the book. I hate the killer, despise his parents (a dismissive father and weak mother), and I'm not crazy about his dog, Grendel (though she doesn't know any better).<br /><br />On the other hand, I admire the hard-working, dedicated detectives, who work day and night to stop the murderer and hopefully rescue a fourth victim. Erika is still experiencing angst about her cop husband who was killed in the line of duty, but a burgeoning relationship between Erika and Peterson may signal better times ahead.<br /><br />The story held my attention and I was anxious to see how things played out. It was also interesting to see how the detectives discover clues, make deductions, and track down the killer. My one quibble: books that feature cops vs. a sociopathic serial killer are pretty common, and the story has a familiar ring.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend the book to people who like thrillers, especially fans of Erika Foster.<br /><br />Thanks to Netgalley, the author (Robert Bryndza) and the publisher (Bookouture) for a copy of the book.", "images": [], "asin": "B06VY6NMZ3", "parent_asin": "B06VY6NMZ3", "user_id": "AHNZRQNJHNSBVKERNXSWNLKOZ6YQ", "timestamp": 1494556977000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Although there is some content in the book about issues faced more commonly by women, it should be noted that all of the illustrations in the book are of men.

My decision to purchase both What's Your Poo Telling You? and What's My Pee Telling Me? was a mistake.

Reunited with her brother Sam, the world is slightly less terrible than it was before. If she wasn't constantly butting heads with Ringer or arguing about how Evan would be back for her and that he isn't like the Others, things would be almost normal. For a few seconds, anyway, until it looks like Ben is taking a turn for the worse, Ringer and Teacup disappear, and the gang is being watched. Can the gang survive this time? Or has their enemy finally caught up with them?<br /><br />Biggest concern with the book - Ringer. I cannot for the life of me be interested in her character or her story. I find her insufferable and annoying most of the time and to be perfectly honest, I skimmed most of the parts that focused on her. I was expecting Ben, Cassie, and Evan as the main focus and for a few chunks of the book they were, those parts kept me interested. In fact, I loved the parts with Cassie as the narrator, because everyone else made it seem like she was stupid or complaining all the time. Ben made me mad this time. He was obviously in serious need of medical attention the entire book, but continued to push himself, which I think will certainly hurt him in the next book. Even Evan's part made me interested! We got to see more into the lives of the Others and it really shows just how different he is from the rest of them. But why, why, and I can't stress this enough...WHY was there not more of the romance between Evan and Cassie like there was in the first book? I love that so much. Overall, I think this would have been a 4 or maybe even a 5...if there wasn't the POV of Ringer in there.

I had never heard of Stuart Woods, though I do often read and enjoy mysteries.<br /><br />I want to compare my experience with \"Short Straw\" with my readying \"Brass Verdict\" or \"The Lincoln Lawyer\" by Michael Connelly. The lead character of both authors is a lone-wolf lawyer. Both lead characters have had failed relationships. That's about the only similarity, other than that both lawyers face uncertainty, hazard, and adventure in the journeys of their stories.<br /><br />Connelly's characters are human. They express fear, concern, hope, despair. Those of Woods express nothing. Occasionally the stress of a situation causes them to vomit; then Woods' story continues. The characters in \"Short Straw\" interact for often-unknown reasons, but they never have relationships or display reasons for what they do.<br /><br />But the story is pretty good. If you're not looking for characterization or scenic description in a novel, Woods writes well. There is no mystery to \"Short Straw.\" Early on, readers know who did what. The two reasons for reading the book are to find out how it ends, and I can't think of what the other one was. But, I enjoyed the story; I was pulled into the action. Some scenes were unusual and interesting. The dialogue was \"snappy.\" I just bought from Amazon the prequel to \"Short Straw,\" \"Santa Fe Rules.\" If you're tempted to read \"Short Straw,\" do yourself a favor and read \"Santa Fe Rules\" first.<br /><br />The way to read this novel is when your internet collection is slow and you have a few minutes while files are downloading.

It's better than a lot of fiction out there, but I didn't think this book was the best thing for vampires since the invention of the blood bank.  It's not bad, which is why I put my rating in the middle, but the plotting is definitely lackluster and the protagonists are too predictable.<br />What I liked-- the villains.  Rashad is far more interesting than the male protagonist.  A creature of wit, style and sentiment.  You wouldn't catch Rashad drinking himself into a stupor.  The villains are more complex than the protagonists, more three dimensional, and have the added fillip of doing bad things for a reason, not just being evil because the author needed some evil villains.<br />The concept of the Noble Dead.  I don't know if this is original with the authors or they picked it up somewhere, but it's a nice term that resonates with some of the other terms used to describe dangerous creatures that we don't want to offend.<br />The part I wasn't particularly interested in: First, the reader who doesn't know where the series is going is very new to vampire fiction.  The title gives that away.<br />Second the protagonists are ok but don't particularly compel interest:  Young female with a mysterious background who ran away from home at an early age with mystic items left for her by her missing father of significantly higher social status-- Young half elf who drinks to forget his tormented past (but we are told all about it 3/4 of the way through the book). The dream of the female half of this odd partnership is to settle down in a real home.<br />So they try to settle down and that's when things get really dangerous.<br />The quest is a mainstay of adventure stories but it has to shine hard and bright not soft and soggy as a stale cookie.

It was well-written for it's target audience (teens), I thought, and very entertaining for me. I found myself quickly entwined in the lives of Bella Swan and Edward Cullens. I tore through books 1 - 3 in the series and while they weren't without some flaws, they were really great reads. SO, I forked out the money for Book 4 \"Breaking Dawn\" believing that I'd be entertained beyond measure because that's when the clinchers fall like rain and surely all the bad reviews I was hearing about it were wrong since books 1 - 3 were great. Authors save the best for last, right? I was very sadly disappointed. The book starts out wonderful enough with a beautiful wedding. Then we jump to the honeymoon (which doesn't go into explicit details and keeps the reading at the intended age) and see Edward and Bella enjoying married life until something threatens their happiness - but instead of focusing on that we jump into another story. WHAT?! After I gathered my bearings, I sluggishly trudged through the most boring portion of the book. The thoughts/insights/perception of Jacob Black (\"werewolf\"). From that point on, I mostly sighed dejectedly through the book. It just seemed so hastily written that you couldn't wind your way fully into the story. Renesme could have definitely been reworked a bit to make it more believable, Jacob's imprinting shouldn't have been so ridiculously stupid, the whole \"battle\" was even more laughable - though you are happy to have certain characters still intact by the end of the book. My biggest issue was the speed in which all the changes start taking place and the huge leaps that were made to make some concepts believable.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not an heirloom recipe", "text": "I got this on the cheap, remaindered at Borders, and was in the mood for something like this. It's a quick read, has its fun moments, but it's not some fantastic book. I like the premise, that Julie Powell is feeling a bit of a life crisis: Close to age 30, feels a bit aimless in life, and decides she wants to cook all recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It looks like a fun, unusual challenge, and reading about it is enjoyable. But I'm getting tired of women who are so horrified of turning 30. Seriously, it's not such a bad thing. Thirty isn't old anymore!<br /><br />But in between you read about her government job, which she doesn't like, but what she complains about doesn't sound that horrible. Government jobs have their reputation for red tape, etc., but for someone who wanted to be an actress but for some reason never followed through and starts up a cooking blog, it's almost, why complain? Just do something about it! But I guess that's where the 'project' got started. Worst is I get the impression she doesn't even like to cook (in the book she says she started to impress the guy she ends up marrying). That's not really a passion for cooking, but just an attempt to bait a guy.<br /><br />As for the cookbook, she tackles all recipes. It seems like she did them in order, which makes no sense to me, as I think you'd want to bounce around for variety's sake. But there almost isn't enough cooking in this cooking memoir, and in between you hear about her eccentric friends, selling her eggs for money (and her fertility issue) and her supportive husband and her blog and some of the attention she gets. It's a cute, real fairy tale, but it's missing something: A little bite, a little spice.  The parts I liked best were the tidbits between the Julie chapters about Julia Child's life. I wanted more of these mini-chapters. But when those little amuse-bouches prove more enjoyable than the main course, that's not good.", "images": [], "asin": "031610969X", "parent_asin": "031610969X", "user_id": "AFMX6ZAW5QT3ZP2W5QYSVNN4MWKA", "timestamp": 1237210588000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Emotionally unengaging, and too much unexplained to involve the reader", "text": "It's always a toss-up whether post-apocalyptic/dystopian novels will be successful at connecting with the reader's emotions. The best of them can do this, whatever the context. Unfortunately, The Wall misses the mark. It has an interesting premise, but the reader is never really engaged or given enough information about the general circumstances to feel much towards the main character or to judge his perspective.<br /><br />Kavanagh has reached the age at which every male and female serves two years as a guard on the cement barrier built around an island nation inundated by rising oceans, trying to keep out everyone else (The Others). The island appears to be England, with the station Kavanagh serves at called Ilfracombe, which today is a town on the north Devonshire coast. Hundreds of thousands serve at any one time around the perimeter of the country. It's a lonely, desolate job, with 12-hour shifts and constant cold, boredom, and fear. \"Others\" who manage to get past the Wall are usually caught quickly because they aren't chipped and are easily identified. But for every Other who makes it and isn't caught, a guard is expelled in a boat to become an Other. Kavanagh makes friends with the guards in his unit, with whom he sometimes spends his holidays (one free week each month or so), and he begins a tentative romance with one of them. The parents of this generation are routinely despised, at best, for it was on their watch that the world fell apart, and yet they elected to bring children into this new world. On the other hand, Breeders, couples who decide to get pregnant, are given special privileges so that the country won't completely fail and the Wall will always have enough guards.<br /><br />There are the makings here for a fantastic story, but it just doesn't gel. The focus is on 1) the misery of the job, 2) the fear that one will become an Other or die if there is an attack, and 3) the misery of the job (yup, the book dwells on it that much). Very little historical context is given. Kavanagh clearly knows how his country works, what's happening around the world, and what the actual apocalypse was. He just doesn't bring it up in telling his story. I would have liked an explanation of how the oceans could have risen an implied minimum of 15 or 20 feet in one generation. The older members of the society still watch TV and are addicted to movies and documentaries about how their lives were \"before\" (especially anything with scenes of beaches, which have been made impossible by the Wall). Transportation, weapons, clothing - all seems pretty much from our today. Food is limited by what currently grows in season. Innovation has largely stopped. In other ways, little has changed: the wealthy still find ways to live in luxury, paying for Help (captured Others who have chosen to become life-long servants rather than be sent back to the sea) and flying off to places around the world as they will. In other words, this is not civilization building.<br /><br />So, give it a go if you enjoy this genre, but you've been warned: you might find it wanting.", "images": [], "asin": "1324001631", "parent_asin": "1324001631", "user_id": "AHUFQMXOCVT7H7C4ICHWMKDKXFYQ", "timestamp": 1553216215473, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I Wanted to Like This Book Far More Than I Did", "text": "This review is of \u201cSavage Abandon\u201d by Rochelle Wayne.<br /><br />The book begins in 1854, in a Comanche Indian village afflicted with cholera. Among those afflicted is Lone Bear, a 12-year old child. His family leaves him due to die in the village to save themselves. He is found by two white men, Jacob McAllister, an Army scout, and Carl Morgan, a doctor. The two men nurse Lone Bear back to health, and Carl adopts him and takes him back to his home in Boston, renaming him Travis Morgan.<br /><br />Fast forward 18 years. Shelaine Evans, the heroine of the book, has come to Arizona to be with her father, Army major Robert Evans. (Robert and Shelaine\u2019s mother, Jennifer, were estranged over Robert\u2019s wish to remain in the Army in the west, as opposed to moving back east. Jennifer has since passed and now Shelaine is going to live with her father). Before she arrives, however, she nearly drowns trying to save a child from a carriage accident in a raging river. Shelaine is saved by an Indian named Tsalalute, whom she is immediately attracted to. She is heartbroken, however, to discover that Robert passed three days before she arrived. Shelaine then becomes the companion to a young woman, Diane Gardner, whose father, rancher Forrest Gardner, wants someone to teach Diane-who is a tomboy-to be a lady. (There\u2019s more to the story than that). Diane later falls in love with Tsalalute\u2019s friend, Daring Wolf. This creates problems with Diane and Forrest, as he has a deep hatred for Indians of any tribe.<br /><br />When Shelaine meets Tsalalute again, she sees him in a different way. This time, he is in his other guise, as Travis Morgan. They become lovers.<br />When Daring Wolf is captured and accused of staging raids, Lone Bear, as Travis, frees him. Afterward, Travis and Daring Wolf \u201ckidnap\u201d Diane and Shelaine. (Diane and Shelaine aren\u2019t entirely unwilling to go with them). Daring Wolf marries Diane, but Shelaine refuses to marry Travis. They argue over the reasons, as both assume untrue reasons why the other won\u2019t marry them. We also learn more about Lone Bear\u2019s history as Travis Morgan and about his mother, Little Doe. Shelaine and Lone Bear agree to marry as soon as he reunites with his mother and they can be married at an Army Fort.<br />Gardner wants Diane back-for reasons that have nothing to do with love-and posted a reward for her return. This encouraged a group of ruffians to try to take Diane and Shelaine out of the Comanche village; this effort doesn\u2019t succeed but a second attempt led by Gardner does. When he finds Diane and discovers she is pregnant with Daring Wolf\u2019s child, Gardner imprisons her in their home; he also hatches a sinister plan for her unborn child.<br /><br />Shelaine is kidnapped by a Comanche brave who is angry with all whites due to the fact that his wife was killed by Forrest when he entered the Comanche village where she had been, but wasn\u2019t at the time. Travis later frees Shelaine, they agree to marry, and they-as well as Diane and Daring Wolf-have their Happily Ever After.<br /><br />Upside: Ms Wayne is pretty much at her typical writing style here, and that\u2019s a good thing. She produces likeable characters in Shelaine and Travis, and few authors of her time spent more time on their supporting characters than Ms. Wayne did.<br /><br />Downside: I didn\u2019t find Shelaine or Travis to be that deep, especially Shelaine (her entire backstory is told in chapter 1, and from there, the focus is on where she is in the current phase of the book. They also aren\u2019t particularly dynamic characters who can carry the lead of a book. Neither, for that matter, are Diane and Daring Wolf. It\u2019s never explained exactly why Forrest Gardner hates Indians with such passion.<br /><br />In every one of Ms. Wayne\u2019s books, a female character finds herself in peril and needing to be saved by a male character. Those who read my reviews know how I feel on this subject, so I won\u2019t repeat those views here.<br /><br />There are plenty of scenes in \u201cSavage Abandon\u201d which have high emotion potential. Ms. Wayne doesn\u2019t bring out those emotions, however.<br /><br />Sex: Multiple sex scenes. Most are fairly mild.<br /><br />Violence: Attempted rape, assault and battery, shootings. None of the violence is graphic.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A pleasant book, but had the potential to be much more.", "images": [], "asin": "0821715054", "parent_asin": "0821715054", "user_id": "AF57ERGRF5IBJURVL5SOCCEVU7IQ", "timestamp": 1565222226389, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

To make a comparison: I may be one of few people who didn't like the film, [[ASIN:B000TXP56C Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]; it seemed more a series of dry philosophical debates than a story. Well, this book felt very much the same. As in the quote above, Matthiessen felt he needed to write it as fiction, but it reads like an essay. Its group of stereotypical (and mostly unlikeable) characters just debate a series of heated topics, among them whether Germans should feel guilt; whether Jews were passive and co-responsible; whether there's any place for Holocaust commerce (art, literature, tourism). Emotion comes into the book through two sub-plots, but one left me unsatisfied and the other annoyed me.<br /><br />I liked the language enough that I'll likely try an earlier novel by Matthiessen.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not worth it.", "text": "\"Brothers In Arms\" by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton.  Subtitled \"The Epic Story Of The 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's  Forgotten Heroes\". Broadway books, New York, 2004.<br /><br />Studying History gives you exposure to the overall events of World War II, and the general ebb and flow of the European Theater of Operations, such as which unit attacked which enemy unit and the results. After an MA in History,  I am always seeking more interesting personal accounts, i.e. personal reminiscences, describing what really happened.  This book, \"Brothers In Arms\", appeared to be just that: the personal memoirs of black soldiers in a tank battalion in the EOT, with all those daily minimal details, woven into a real and personal story of the men who served.  Even more interesting, these soldiers were black.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the book did not live up to its promise.  The stories about the individuals involved, with the possible exception of  Leonard \"Smitty\" Smith, did not, in my humble opinion, bring those individuals alive.  Even the nice repetition , (but disrupting to the continuity of the book), of Baseball's Jackie Robinson's wartime experiences were not truly a personal remembrance.<br /><br />Then there are the unnecessary mistakes.  As other reviewers have mentioned the worst gaffe, the German word for panther, is \"Panther\" and \"Panzer\" means, basically,  armor or tanks.  See page 47.  The Luftwaffe's  rotund Hermann Goering is probably rotating rapidly in his grave since this book identifies him as the skinny Nazi propaganda minister.  On page 45, the authors state that  in the Pacific theater, in 1942, \"American and Japanese forces were at a stalemate\".  Sorry!  The Battle of Midway, June 1942, was the turning point and it was downhill for Japan after that. The \"stalemate\" characterization  was wrong.  On page 70, the authors have General George S. Patton being born in 1895; he was born in 1885.  Just as another example,  the book states that the German \"Teller\"  Anti-Tank mines had about one pound of explosive in them.  I could not understand why a \"Teller\" mine should threaten a Sherman tank, so I went on the Web.  There I found that the early models of the German Teller mines  had about 23 pounds, or about ten kilograms, of explosive.  I could see that this concentrated explosive force could do damage to some parts of the Sherman.  My complaint is the book's authors let this poundage gaffe go into print.<br /><br />So , for the personal memoirs, I gave four stars.  For the mistakes , (too many!) and evident lack of knowledge about the History of the EOT, I gave zero stars.  Average: two stars.", "images": [], "asin": "0385503385", "parent_asin": "0385503385", "user_id": "AGFNB7T2TJ6IS7RFQXSV4LG6UJOQ", "timestamp": 1111088447000, "helpful_vote": 18, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "It's always risky...", "text": "...to read the novel before seeing the film adaptation. Because usually, the comparison does the movie no favours.<br />However, as I've learned here, sometimes there's a greater risk to seeing the film first.<br /><br />As much as this is meant to be a review of the novel, the truth is that having seen the film, my view of the book is informed in so very starkly a way that I fear I cannot offer up as objective opinion as I otherwise might have.<br /><br />As a screenwriter/novelist, I'm always fascinated to see how the migration from one medium to the other is achieved, and to what extent it's successful. In the case of 'The Jane Austen Book Club', one thing was consistently apparent: the adaptation succeeded marvellously. In fact, in many ways, the film is a far more satisfying experience.<br /><br />But allow me to clarify.<br /><br />Firstly, I have no history, no relationship with Austen's novels. I've read not a one. So clearly, what Fowler waves through her story Austen-wise, was lost on me. Not that I couldn't appreciate that she was clearly a lover of Austen's works and had fashioned a tale as an homage to the writer. I'm sure that a fan of Austen's books would have added many a satisfaction-point onto their final score. But I suppose what struck me most in this sense was the fact that the movie seemed to do a far better job of utilizing the themes and characters than the novel does.<br /><br />Secondly, while the film is focused, the novel is...well, a lot more of a riff. And perhaps this can be chalked up mostly to the narrator's voice. In the film, it's a typical 'third-person omniscient'. In the book- Well, I still can't figure out why Fowler decided to tell it in first-person omniscient...and then, never really declare that it's being told by Bernadette. In fact, I don't know why she chose to use the narrative voice she did, at all. It makes no sense...first-person cannot be omniscient when we're talking about the narrator having access to information they'd not have access to...and in the end, came off as contrived. In fact, to a certain extent, it ruined the book for me.<br /><br />Finally, the film, while not utilizing much of the novel's narrative, uses what it does explore much better than the book. In fact, maybe this was what surprised me most, that the movie is much more cohesive, does a far better job at delving into characters...it makes more sense. These criticisms are usually made about the film, not the source material, hence my surprise.<br /><br />The novel is lovely. A little scattered, a little idiosyncratic, but with some enchanting touches. (Having read the book, I can attest to the fact that the movie missed some opportunities...but the writer/director should be proud of what she accomplished.) I wouldn't glow about it the way some of the jacket blurbs did...but then I'm not an Austen-ite...and I'm not a woman.<br /><br />I'd like to think that Jane would forgive me both.", "images": [], "asin": "B000X7CN64", "parent_asin": "0399151613", "user_id": "AHYQADUEQJRRSQK6F7YQ6EES4VTQ", "timestamp": 1235777532000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

This is the first book I've read in the \"cozy mystery\" genre, and everything about it was just a bit too cute for my taste. Much of the plot was highly improbable. The basic plot involves tea shop owner Theodosia Browning trying to figure out why a local orchid aficionado dropped dead immediately after winning a rare specimen at an orchid auction. There's not much else to say about the plot, so I'll get on to the elements I found unbelievable or troublesome. First, the prose is chock-full of description that seems to serve little purpose. Second, there's really no character development. The characters are entirely one-dimensional. Third, the elements of the story and completely implausible. What police chief allows a random civilian to drop off key evidence in a homicide investigation to him at her convenience? Finally, all the extraneous elements of the story are just a bit too perfect. Everything is the best and the nicest.- the nicest tea shop, the most popular bed and breakfast. The tea shop has an unflappable chef who can always make just the most perfect pastries. All this saccharine is more than a little tiresome.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "'Unspoken Truth' Review [MINOR SPOILERS]", "text": "I've come across more than a few reviews of this book online, and the one gleaming review posted on Amazon at the time of this posting. The reviews have really lauded this book as great, a must-read, wonderful ... but the book I read is anything but. It is horribly dull, contrived and just a step above fan-fiction that you could Google and get online. I've read both [[ASIN:0743464079 Catalyst of Sorrows (Star Trek: The Lost Era, 2360)]] and [[ASIN:0743496930 Burning Dreams (Star Trek)]], both by Margaret Wander Bonanno, and both dealing with unanswered questions from the 'Original Series' era. In brief, 'Unspoken Truth' is supposed to do for the character of Saavik what 'Burning Dreams' did for Captain Pike: give a underused character in Trek lore his/her moment in the spotlight and reveal new and interesting things about them that the tv series and movies left untouched. I was disappointed to say that 'Unspoken Truth' really is a bust and dropped the ball when it comes to doing justice for the character of Saavik. Perhaps it missteps in trying to insert the character into one of the most unoriginal plots one could think of: the heroine is pushed to her limits and is lost emotionally after traumatizing events and extreme circumstances (Star Trek: Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock and The Voyage Home). As a result, she reflects on her past and is recruited by the 'enemy' to ruin her mentor, Sarek's, career. Now, 'Burning Dreams' and 'Catalyst of Sorrows' both worked well because their plots didn't involve an outcome we were too sure about. We all know from other Trek movies, shows and books that Sarek lived a long life and his career never suffered a setback as this book tries to hint at. Thus, the reader is treated to a long, drawn out novel that at the end feels very predictable, contrived and horribly executed.<br /><br />The Good: The only good I have to say about this novel is that I enjoyed the scenes that filled-in between the movies. We're treated to what could be considered 'cut' or bonus scenes from Star Trek: The Search for Spock and Star Trek: The Voyage Home. Kirk worrying about Spock returning to his old self after the events of Star Trek: The Search for Spock and Voyage Home was actually entertaining, as was McCoy's few appearances. Another character that seemed to get a lot of great scenes was Amanda, who is seen and portrayed more as a mother in this novel than as a wife as she usually is in most novels. Beyond these two areas, there's not much to praise.<br /><br />The Bad: Where to begin. I feel 'Unspoken Truth' is guilty of really confusing and giving the character of Saavik a makeover when none was necessary. Compared to what was shown in the movies and what was written about Saavik in other novels, this one turns her into a rebellious teen with unchecked emotional problems, lacking common sense and devoid of logic. Basically, gone is the Saavik of the movies and in her place is a character from some 1980s brat pack movie. Every sentence that Saavik thinks or says seems to end with an exclamation point as if she is forever mad or on edge. This book (to my knowledge) rewrites her character's history a bit to make it so that she was found by Spock as a young child, brought home, raised by Sarek and Amanda, mentored by 'big brother' Spock ... and I'm sorry, but the author does nothing to make any of this, or Saavik's relationship with any of the characters, believable. Part of this problem is that there are two plots going on within this book that hardly go together and so both end up being short-changed. The plot described on the back of the book ... sorry to reveal that it doesn't even occur until page 209 at which point it's rushed and pushed through and never fully developed. The majority of the book deals with Saavik seeking a quiet, un-eventful mission following the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. That's exactly what she gets and what the reader must sit through and endure. The first 200 pages of this novel are for the most part a total bore. Then comes the Romulan plot to recruit Saavik to ruin Sarek's career. It's contrived, predictable and meanders without any true focus. A couple of pages in, you're able to guess the outcome at every twist and turn. Annoyingly, 'unspoken truth' appears in the dialogue various times but I must say by the end, I have no idea what the author was trying to refer to or get at with the title. The end of the novel ends with dialogue that made this feel like 'The Little Mermaid' made-over for Star Trek: Father-figure Sarek realizes he can't force Vulcan tradition on his daughter Saavik and that he and Amanda have raised her to the best of their ability and must let her go off into the vast universe on her own. Seriously.<br /><br />Let me not forget to mention that Saavik also finds a new love in this novel and behaves like a promiscuous teenager in heat, at once jumping into bed and a complicated relationship with her new guy ... even after pages of her agonizing over how mating with Spock in Star Trek: The Search for Spock was unwise and complicated her life and brought her much grief and personal shame. So, again, what in the world? I don't understand why so many readers are jumping for joy over this book when it's nothing more than a harlequin romance novel set in the Star Trek universe. This book is pretty much character assassination for the character of Saavik. It doesn't do anything to make her any more clear, likable or smart/intelligent as she was portrayed in the films and in other books. It was as if someone gave Bonanno free range to do as she pleased with the character(s) (because not even Sarek or Spock feel totally in character). On an entirely different note, was this the absolute best cover Pocket Books could come up with because it seems like a pretty lame cop-out for doing something more representative of the events of the novel. I guess this is supposed to be Vulcan, perhaps Sarek's residence ... whatever the case, it's never explained or linked to the events of the novel. Could they not have, I don't know, put an image of Saavik on the cover since the novel is about her?<br /><br />Avoid this book. I rarely give out 1 star reviews but this was by far the worst book I've read in a long time. It's dull, the first 200 pages have nothing at all to do with the book's description and even that plot is dull, lacking and poorly written. I expected a lot more from the author who has written some great novels but as said, this book certainly isn't one of them. The author managed to turn one of Trek's most interesting characters into nothing more than a cardboard cut-out from an adolescent novel. The plot does not feel original and is planted in the middle of a time period and dealing with characters whose outcomes we're aware of and thus can easily predict the outcome of the book, making reading this horrible mess of a novel pretty much wasted money and paper. The novel ends with Saavik pretty much where she was when the novel began and looking forward to getting back to duty and returning to the Enterprise if Kirk and crew will have her. Uh, we all saw Star Trek IV: The Final Frontier and the films that followed so yet again, we know the outcome of that event. This novel was, in my opinion, a missed opportunity. I'd rather have been treated to a novel that filled in a piece of Star Trek history that hasn't been covered to death and was unknown to the reader so that reading it would have created more history. Perhaps having focused on Saavik post Original Series movie era, or even before she came into the picture and really explored her alone, not attached to Spock or Sarek, would have improved the novel. Whatever the case, I can't in good conscience recommend this novel to anyone.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "It\u2019s also super fun to Google variations of the sentiment in order ...", "text": "The concept of fiction as a lie whose subtext is actually truth has been around for a long, long time. It\u2019s also super fun to Google variations of the sentiment in order to see how many quotes you can find that are variations of the tune:<br /><br />\u201cFiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.\u201d \u2013Albert Camus, author-<br /><br />\u201cArt is a lie that tells the truth.\u201d \u2013Pablo Picasso, painter-<br /><br />\u201cFiction reveals truth that reality obscures.\u201d \u2013Ralph Waldo Emerson, poet-<br /><br />\u201cTruth is stranger than fiction, judgie wudgie.\u201d \u2013Curly, Stooge-<br /><br />It\u2019s one of those witticisms that\u2019d likely be labeled a clich&eacute; if it weren\u2019t so matter-of-factly true for so many people who dabble in fiction. Authors have a tendency to write what they know. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Jo Walton personally knew a bunch of fairies at one point or another in the course of her life, but there is a subtext to her imaginings that are likely pinned on a lived and/or learned experience. Fiction is often an extreme elaboration for something gnawing away at writer. Fahrenheit 451, for example, was about the destruction of books and ideas. It wasn\u2019t that Bradbury was quaking in his boots at the thought of suppressive fascism, as it is often thought, but was a cry in the dark by a man who fiercely loathed television and believed it was a machine that made people much dumber than they ought to be, and kept them from reading.<br /><br />Also, Jo Walton is the kind of person that will use a word like \u201caxiomatically\u201d in the opening line of her acknowledgements. It\u2019s only fair to allow her the pretension of her claim that the fairies were real. Of course the fairies were real. Any reader worth his or her salt accepts axiomatically the reality of fairies.<br /><br />But allow me to dial back the harsh nature of my criticisms. Jo Walton claims the reality of fairies for two reasons, 1) because she is selling herself as an author of imaginative whimsy, and it\u2019s a good line to leave off on, and 2) she is really implying the virtues of imagination, which can have as much worth as any old bit of reality.<br /><br />About half way through the book is a passage about dolls that encapsulates the wonderful, tangible reality of imagination and the banality of the real:<br /><br />\u201cThe problem with Rosebud and her really talking was that our other dolls could pretend talk, and that was better. Our collection of dolls\u2026had epic adventures surviving after nuclear wars or rescuing dragons from evil princesses. Battered old Pippa, with her one arm and her ragged hair\u2026could stand there vowing defiance and revenge against the evil Dog Overlord\u2026and Rosebud couldn\u2019t compete when all she could say was \u201cLet\u2019s play schoo-ul.\u201d (pg. 159-160)<br /><br />Rosebud the doll is meant to emulate the really real world. Notice, too, that the doll not only represents bland reality, but implores children to \u201cplay schoo-ul,\u201d which is far from what most children want to be bothered with.<br /><br />Reality is for suckers, and that\u2019s definitely something I accept axiomatically.<br /><br />Now, I know that this review is a bit sarcasm-heavy, but I would be lying if I tried to tell you that it wasn\u2019t beautifully written. I can make that concession, though I cannot claim to be the audience for this particular story.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Ms. Evanovich Please Let Stephanie Grow Up", "text": "Ten Big Ones is not a bad book.  The reader gets introduced to Ranger's hideout (the Rangeman facility) and his apartment on the 7th floor.  Now THAT is fun because who doesn't want to know more about Ranger!  In this book Ranger still maintains that sultry classiness which makes him desirable (the classiness which he loses in book 17 when he is brought down to Stephanie's low class level).  In this book he remains an enigma.  Which is what makes his character so interesting.  We also get to see a faint glimpse of independence in the Stephanie Plum character.  A tiny bit of feminism that her character is almost always completely lacking.  Unfortunately, just as soon as we glimpse it, the author yanks it away.  Stephanie Plum isn't amusing as much as she is cringe worthy.  Which makes me sad.  I would like for Stephanie Plum to be more of a hero.  I would like her to be deserving of Morelli or Ranger.  Ten Big Ones starts out with the worn out rehash of the \"car incident\" (with a car always being spray painted, blown up or catching on fire).  The rest of the book is Stephanie making the usual questionable and even stupid decisions, Stephanie and Lula driving all around Trenton, Stephanie's life being threatened and Stephanie having to be rescued, blah blah blah.  The \"mystery\" factors are always weak and it's the same with book 10.  There is the usual page after endless page of (fattening) food descriptions.  At least in this book the author gets honest and admits the truth about the main character.  Stephanie is asked multiple times if she's pregnant.  Stephanie herself comments on how disgusted she is with her own body. There is nothing sexy about Stephanie Plum. The author asking readers to believe that either Morelli or Ranger would ever look twice at Stephanie as a potential romantic or sexual partner is really pushing the borders of fantasy.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Descending order of good", "text": "When I bought this book, I did so because I like the concept of space marines.  I did not know it was a Warhammer40k tie in, and I knew nothing about the game's universe.  When I realized what I had bought, I figured I'd give it a shot anyway.<br /><br />The leading short story is pretty good.  It's actually a pretty classic senario of small force fighting off a greater.  Quite a bit of it comes off as over the top, like how thirty men fought off hundreds over many hours.  Not great, but a good set up for the characters and their basic motivations.<br /><br />The first book, \"Nightbringer\", surprised me.  The political intrigue around the attempted raising of a sleeping being of ancient powers worked quite well for me.  I thought that the characters worked well and the interactions were believable.  I was quite pleased, actually.  But this is the best of the three books contained in this omnibus.<br /><br />The second book, \"Warriors of Ultamar\", was more of a straight \"blow everything up and move towards a goal\" story.  There was some small intrigue and several new characters, but they both seemed flat and stale.  One group of minor characters, a selfish street gang, never showed any development at all over the story which begged the question why they were included at all.  This is not a horrible book, and the alien menace is quite clever, but it isn't something that would bring me back.<br /><br />The third book, \"Dead Sky, Black Sun\", was the same sort of linear tale as the second one, but just nasty.  On the \"Eye of Terror\", an outcast planet of horrors, the author unleashes all the disgust of a bad splatter movie.  I felt queasy reading parts of it and the plot didn't help distract from the gore.  At times, this book was just a protracted bloodbath of nastiness.  The characters became even more flat, right down to the recycled dialog from \"Star Wars\".  It ends with a touch of cliffhanger, one that I will never have resolved as I plan to read no more of these works.<br /><br />The first book is worth reading, wheather you are interested in the game or not.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Stereotyping College Life", "text": "This book is about the corruption of a young American girl from Sparta, a remote mountain town in North Carolina, who makes it against all odds to a top university in Pennsylvania (\"Dupont\"), only to find out that not top-notch education but rather sex, alcohol, drugs and generlly being \"cool\" are top-most on her fellow students' minds. Tom Wolfe paints a vivid picture of college life on American campuses, or at least that's what he would have us believe, not too successfully in my mind.<br /><br />I guess Wolfe was out to write the definitive book about college life. And indeed the book is nothing but a long (700+ pages) description of the frivolities of college students. It is full of stereotypical characters: the basketball players who get academic discounts and lead a life (literally) above the rest, the drunken frat boys and the giggly sorority girls, the group of smart nerds who are after the Rhodes scholarship and, above all, the innocent hillybilly who cannot believe it all - Charlotte. Wolfe, in his charcteristic style, does not leave much to the imagination when describing Charlotte's encounter with college life. One of ther first experiences on campus are the sounds produced by a boy defecating loudly in the stalls of the co-ed bathroom (I will spare you the details). Shortly thereafter, Charlotte's room-mate throws her out in the middle of the night so that she can spend time there alone with her boyfriend; thus Charlotte learns what it means to be \"sexiled\". And so on and so forth.<br /><br />Despite its weakness in credibility - I refuse to believe this is what life in Ivy League colleges is all about - what saves this book is Wolfe's excellent writing style, captivating the reader and transporting him to a world that although removed from reality seems at the same time very realistic. I read the book while travelling between three continents and it was a faithful companion on the long flights and sleepless nights. As far as pop fiction goes, it's an entertaining read.<br /><br />One final thought. Wolfe, author of excellent books such as Bonfire of Vanities and A Man in Full, gives thanks in the foreward to the book to his daughters, who apparently let him into the secret lives of college students based on first-hand experiences. If I am Charlotte Simmons faithfully portrays what Wolfe's daughters went through in college, I shudder to think how he reacted, as a father, when hearing their stories.", "images": [], "asin": "0312424442", "parent_asin": "0312424442", "user_id": "AFB74PLDJXKWLXPWZOYZNGFDCGVQ", "timestamp": 1237192522000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Falls Short", "text": "I'm just not sure what Dan Fesperman was aiming for in his novel, &#34;The Prisoner of Guantanamo;&#34; a thriller, a character study of GITMO and its prisoners, the watchers and the watched, a comment on moral ambiguity, all the above? Whatever Fesperman was aiming for, it gets lost in the translation, as if written originally in Arabic and translated by someone for whom the language was as difficult as the culture from whence it comes.<br /><br />I will say that the novel is interesting in its portrayal of GITMO and its environs, interrogators, security personnel, and inmates, but one would be better served by using the Internet to research the prison, its operation, and culture, as long as one does due diligence on the authors and their motives. For example, Gordon Cucullu has written a non-fiction book on GITMO that's very detailed in its description of the place, but quite biased in its treatment of the operation and culture. Joseph Margulies' book covers the establishment of GITMO and its legal precedents and implications. Using the search term on the ProPublica web site will produce numerous stories covering everything from imprisonment at GITMO to trial of GITMO prisoners. The point is, if you're looking for details on GITMO and its prisoners, fiction, even by someone as presumably well-informed as Fesperman, isn't the place to get it.<br /><br />So, that brings us back to book as a representative of the &#34;thriller&#34; genre. Here too, the book falls short. Fesperman builds up slowly to a denouement that never really materializes in any sensible or even satisfying manner. The buildup is slow enough that what seem extraneous &#34;adventures&#34; (scenes) are interjected in an attempt to maintain reader interest. To some extent they do, only to let the reader down even harder at the conclusion.<br /><br />It's my belief that Fesperman never really had a final revelation in mind when he started writing the book, and when he finally got to the final chapter and epilogue he, his protagonist, Revere Falk, and the rest of us were left wondering, &#34;What was the point?&#34;", "images": [], "asin": "1400096146", "parent_asin": "1400096146", "user_id": "AGVXKM7RQQTKUOY6B4J6VAHAFETQ", "timestamp": 1361129686000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

He has zero authority beyond his own city.  And should Alex Cross execute him, it goes against all of his principles which we admire so much.  It was a lose-lose situation from the get go.<br /><br />The brutality toward Cross himself was boggling...and silly at the same time, since one day he is stripped of all of his papers, including passport and money, beaten brutally and next thing you know he is dining with friends, only to be captured and beaten again, and be released again.  There was no rhyme or reason and the violence was gratuitous, just the sort of thing I hate. I don't mind reading about violence if it seems integral to the part, but not violence to add more violence to an already violent book.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with this book.

For example for &#34;I&#34; the page says &#34;I is for ink, that makes my hands blue&#34; and has a picture of a girl holding her hands up and the hands are blue. The issue I have with this is majority of the picture is of the girl's body. So my toddler looks at the picture and says &#34;girl&#34; or points to the body parts and names the body parts. This book is supposed to help teach each letter- why would they choose ink?! There is nothing distinctive about the coloring to even make you think it is &#34;ink&#34;... In fact I covered the sentence describing the letter and asked 5 people what they thought this was a picture of and what letter they thought it was for. All 5 people said &#34;H for hands&#34; which proves my point that using &#34;ink&#34; for the letter &#34;I&#34; was a poor choice. This happens again for &#34;Q&#34;. The sentence chosen to describe &#34;Q&#34; is: &#34;Q is for quiet as the tired puppy sleeps&#34; and it shows a large picture of a dog sleeping. So now my toddler gets to Q and says &#34;dog!&#34; & this is frustrating as I have to teach her that dog is not spelled with a Q. This happens again with &#34;w&#34; described as &#34;W is for wet, when you're splashing around.&#34; While this photo shows a boy with bubbles on him, it doesn't even show water! Once again I asked people what they thought this picture could be for and they said either B for Boy or B for bubble. This is very counter-productive for a parent!! We should have books that are helpful for younger toddlers, not confusing!! even the seemingly simpler pictures, P for piglet or D for duckling.. Why not choose pig or duck? I understand that they chose the correct names (it is a baby duck, so they call it duckling), but for the sake of word association just use a picture of an adult duck. A 15 month old isn't going to be able to comprehend duckling vs duck and it only confuses the child! Lastly, they have odd choices for the sensory portion. For K they choose a kitten playing with a ball of yarn. The cut out has access to the yarn for the child to touch. Wouldn't it make more sense to put a cut out to the fur? So the child associates touching soft fur of the kitten for K? Not yarn...?<br /><br />To the author/publishing company- please change the Q page to Queen. I page to iguana or ice.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Part fascinating, part disheartening", "text": "I knew little about Cilla Black until I saw a television account of her life and realized she was from Liverpool and rose to fame during the height of Beatlemania. And that\u2019s when I purchased her autobiography Cilla Black: What\u2019s It All About? I was truly fascinated by the \u201cinsider\u201d information about the Beatles and the other groups of the time, among them Gerry and the Pacemakers and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. I loved her descriptions of her close friendships with John, Paul, Ringo and George, especially with Ringo who became a very close friend. She signed with the Beatles\u2019s manager Brian Epstein, and her description of him, their friendship, and her devastation at his death were heartening and entertaining. I loved her telling of how she maintained close friendships with her mates from younger years, especially with her childhood friend Pat Davies and Cynthia Lennon, mother of Julian Lennon and first wife of John Lennon. The book is mostly a seemingly heartfelt tribute, rather than a \u201cdish the dirt\u201d memoir. I, not being British nor having lived in England, was surprised that not only did Black achieve the status of the best-selling female vocalist in her country, but also she became a beloved television personality, hosting several long-term shows. So what just is it that turned me off somewhat to this woman? She wants us to believe she is a still a \u201chometown girl\u201d Liverpudlian at heart, simple and true to her upbringing. That may very well be true. But today the woman is a multi-millionaire, and while many celebrities seem to not flaunt that and live quiet lives, Black is so proud of it that she writes of her estate in England, her villa in Spain, and her apartment in Barbados as if we all have the opportunity to own such (or at least care deeply about her comfort.) Furthermore, she seems to want to refute every little gaff she made in her career as an \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way\u201d moment or \u201cthe press misunderstood.\u201d She seems intent, in this book, to whitewash every error she has made in her very public life, when perhaps it would have been best to ignore the tarnish on her silver celebrity status, letting it fade into the history that one forgets. And when she, at the end, lest us know she is on a quest for a perfect pink diamond, one that will cost her well over a million dollars, because she deserves a trinket of that magnitude, I felt like there is no way this boastful wealthy woman has any of her humble Liverpudlian qualities still intact. She just wants us to think that, counting on her adoring fans to say, \u201cWell, we love her and want her to be happy.\u201d She doesn\u2019t dwell on her charitable activities, although she does mention them, but I have to wonder how much that excess-of-a-million dollars would buy if it were channeled into food for the hungry rather than a bauble for her finger.", "images": [], "asin": "0091890357", "parent_asin": "0091890357", "user_id": "AEZEFRB2AQ2EXQ3ZKPLAB7SSL6QA", "timestamp": 1636915003358, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

But that's where the kudos stop.<br /><br />Book is full of errors, questions are vague or weak (but they are that way on the real exam, too). The book constantly repeated itself on many topics and missed lots of material. It was easy to see that the authors and reviewers did not review each other's work. There was some wrong technical information, especially around the crypto section. Many things the book went over heavily, and repeated through several chapters, were not on the exam (e.g. TCP/IP model, project management, etc.).<br /><br />Even their review of the TCP/IP model was wrong. The book constantly referred to the five layers of the model, and the model only has 4 layers.<br /><br />Yes, several of the book's test answers have the incorrect answer choice (as other reviewers have noted), but even worse, often the answer explanation didn't explain the correct answer. Most exam cram type books do poorly on the test questions, and this book was no different.<br /><br />Overall, I think the book only prepared me for about 1/10th of the questions presented on the CISA exam. I was scoring 85-95% on the book questions and rarely guessing, but on the exam I was guessing a lot more (80% of the time). I probably passed (I do well on most exams and I've got about 50 other certifications), but it would have been nice to have been spoon fed the possible questions better.<br /><br />But the real CISA exam is very weird, and like a lot of the other crappy security exams, one book will never prepare, so buy and study at least two.<br /><br />I did not regret buying this book, and I'll lend it to friends.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "All about ordinary guy Joe and little about McCarthy -- or McCathyism", "text": "It is too easy to knock this book, and it is a failure. This is a shame, since the author does a decent job of laying out his story, presenting the sequence of events in a turbulent period and avoiding stereotyping McCarthy as either extreme villain or underappreciated hero. He has obviously worked hard to find the right pitch and tone for his juvenile audience. The writing is crisp and clear.<br /><br />But......<br /><br />The choice of his \"Joe\" perspective and the treating of him as just one of the guys is a major misjudgment. I assume he wanted to avoid the type of demonization so marvelously captured in Richard Condon's novel The Manchurian Candidate, which is gloriously over the top, and the magnificent film version directed by John Frankenheimer, starring a superb Frank Sinatra and even more superb Angela Lansbury. He also tries not to be unfair (I choose the double negative here, because he omits assessment rather than makes conclusions) about the underlying concerns of the Red-baiters and HUAC that McCarthy exploited. (Truth in reviewing; I personally regard them as corrupt, shabby, vicious, mendacious, opportunistic, and devoid of scruple - words that I would apply to McCarthy.)<br /><br />Rather than intrude my own views of the content, here are just a few short quotes from the book that you can use to judge for yourself the likelihood of your getting much insight from reading it. \"This was not the first time... Joe was criticized for mistaking facts.\" \"Joe anxiously awaited the results of the [tax] audit.... He was elated [he got a $1,00 refund].... Joe wasn't content to let the matter end there, however.\" He \"loved to get revenge when he felt someone had treated him unjustly.\" Re Roy Cohn, of whom little good has ever been said and surely was about as vile a person as could be \"I couldn't care less about your politics. I'm only interested in your ability to do the job.\" \"He was also surprised and saddened he would not be welcome [to many Republican leaders] in their local elections in the fall.\" This last remark is about the impact of the Army hearings!<br /><br />The author skips any in-depth discussion of the substance of the political background. That's understandable in trying to write a short book targeted to high schoolers. But there's no texture and key aspects of McCarthy's behavior are skimmed over. Nixon is mentioned only in passing. Roy gets a free pass. Towards the end, his \"drinking heavily\" is mentioned, but in passing. From all accounts, this was a sodden drunk. His motivations are not questioned. His vilification and persecutions of defenseless government and academic individuals are not explained or adequately detailed. While the author lays out facts accurately, they are never fleshed out or put in context. Watch any film or TV presentation of he hearings and the great Ed Murrow counterattack that become McCarthy's fall; the passion, anger, aggression and jousting of the many power players and the sheer drama are so far from the blandness of \"then this happened.... Joe felt saddened.\"<br /><br />I rate this a one-star book, more for what it is not than what it is. It is a workmanlike work (with interesting photos). It is not a solid or resonant portrayal of a figure whose name has become a clich\u00e9. That is, it throws little light on McCarthyism.", "images": [], "asin": "0618610588", "parent_asin": "0618610588", "user_id": "AEEWQHQ6GEIU4OJFNIL6HXF2ANWA", "timestamp": 1258002916000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Returning to the origins of robots via the automatons created for the entertainment of the wealthy and royal, Wilson has crafted another workable piece of fiction centered on robots.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Sticks with you like resin from tobacco plants", "text": "Though it has now been almost 30 years since I last spent a fall afternoon cutting tobacco, spearing the stalks onto wooden staves, and hanging the staves into the curing barn, I still remember the smell of the plants, the stickiness of the resin, the glint of the cutting and spearing tools. This tenuous link to a much earlier time, the time of the tobacco wars that rocked rural Kentucky and Tennessee just before WWII, provided me with just a sliver of insight to the hard times Robert Penn Warren depicts in his first novel, Night Rider.<br />The protagonist, Percy Munn, is an affable but pliable young lawyer, happily married with a growing law practice when he is drawn into supporting \"The Association,\" an ardent band of tobacco farmers, including doctors, politicians, and other men whom \"Perse\" admires and who in turn admire him for his oratory skills, leadership, and status. Percy, himself a tobacco farmer, and the association work to break the economic monopoly exerted by the big tobacco companies (those bastards were evil well before they started lying to the public about the addictive nature of their deadly products). But when legal and ethical means are not enough, the collective leadership starts down a slippery slope of coercing nonassociation members to join or else face the consequences. Bands of \"night riders\" fan out across countryside, first destroying the crops of those who refused their entreaties to join up, then property, until even the taking of human life is justified as a means to their end once they have made the decision to torch the tobacco warehouses in Bardsville and the other towns in the vicinity.<br />Percy Munn finds himself at the center, and as other men whom he admired peel off from The Association because their moral bearing will not allow their continued participation, Percy eventually finds himself cut off from his wife; men such as Capt. Todd whom he greatly admired; Lucille Christian, the woman who tries to save him from himself; and eventually the leaders of The Association who let him take a fall for something he did not do.<br />The story is properly characterized as a tragedy even though Percy Munn is not as noble a central figure as one might expect. His great weakness is that he attaches himself to causes without much thought of the consequences. In other words, he is an idealist, but a flawed one. Though Percy's fall is in part caused by his flaws, a series of betrayals---sometimes he is the betrayer and other times he is betrayed---also conspire against him. When loyalty becomes more a currency than a principal, tragedy is inevitable.<br />Robert Penn Warren captures the speech and mannerisms of this main characters effectively, but he does not develop three-dimensional characters, with the exception of Willie Proudfit, the hard-scrabble, nearly destitute farmer who is something of a mystic who lives life fully and with a fervor Perse cannot experience as he continues his spiral inward. The landscape and settings seem more like those rendered by wood cuttings rather than a photograph. Some of Robert Penn Warren's digressions meander for pages without bolstering the story, and at times the allegorical and naturalistic elements of the novel seem at war with one another.<br />If permitted, I might rate this novel three and a half stars. Reading Night Rider is a worthwhile book for wintertime reading, butit is not the finest work by the author who was to become the first Poet Laureate of the United States.", "images": [], "asin": "1879941147", "parent_asin": "1879941147", "user_id": "AG6M46M6UWHX2LM7XTCOOPK25NKQ", "timestamp": 1014764102000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A real page turner.", "text": "The Charm School opens with a young American tourist, Gregory Fisher, driving in the Soviet Union's countryside in the 1980s. He makes an \"illegal\" stop to do some sightseeing and come across an American POW, recently escaped from a secret KGB training school where they force over 300 American POW's to teach Russians to think, act, and talk like Americans. There's no way Fisher could take the man with him to Moscow without them both being caught. Fisher calls the US Embassy as soon as he gets to his hotel and tells them what the man told him, but the KGB gets to Fisher before the  US Embassy can.<br /><br />Sam Hollis and Lisa Rhodes are the two diplomats who took the call. The Soviets insist that Fisher never checked into his hotel and in fact never reached Moscow, but was killed in when his car missed a turn and went off the road. Sam and Lisa volunteer to go retrieve the body in a ruse to get near the Charm School. They end up killing two guards and fleeing from the KGB after meeting Commander Burov, who unbeknownst to them is in charge of the school.<br /><br />The story action slows down now but you get a good picture of life in the Soviet Union, and also of life in an embassy. Though many of the Russian peasants don't agree with their government, they are powerless to do anything about it.  The government is basically ruling by terror - there is no such thing as a fair trial in the Soviet Union. You read how the common man lives day by day, paycheck to paycheck. The houses are run down, buildings are dilapidated, and the quality of life is very poor compared with Western standards. People will wait for hours in lines for fresh milk.<br /><br />We are introduced to a Soviet officer who has given Sam Hollis much inside information. He offers Sam a list of over 3,000 names of Russians who have gone through the Charm School and are now living in America, in key positions in exchange for safe passage to the West for he and his granddaughter.<br /><br />Sam and Lisa are soon declared persona non gratis by the Soviet Union and must leave. Predictably, their plane is grounded by a mysterious bomb threat and they are transferred to a Soviet Military helicopter where they are taken to the Charm School and given two choices - become instructors or be tortured and shot.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will say that though at times the book was predictable (though still enjoyable), the ending caught me completely by surprise and was perhaps a little sad.<br />This book is definitely a thriller. The beginning of the book kept you on the seat of your pants to find out what happens next, and the last two hundred pages or so were constant page turners.  The only thing I didn't like, as with all Nelson DeMille novels, was the frequent foul language and the occasional sex scene, which really doesn't add anything to the story at all.

I was friends with Lynne when we met at a Westgate Doll Show back in 1980. If you knew the real Lynne, as I did, you would never write about her most torturous end of her life. Lynne was very private, hiding behind a perfect front that she had to put on every day. Just knowing that these horrific moments of her end, would be shared with others, would make her beyond sad forever.<br /><br />Lynne and I were a month apart, and when we went to our doll shows or meetings, we had such fun. She told me, this was the only place she could be herself, without having to be the perfect wife, perfect hostess, perfect daughter or perfect mother. She was so sad about life\u2019s problems and imperfections, as she only wanted everything perfect, like the person she forced herself to be. Lynne shared with me all the things in life, that she just couldn\u2019t cope with- having rats in her beautiful  home on Wooster coming up through every opening in the home, due to Rocky River\u2019s sewer issues with rats. She would call me up crying, that she opened her kitchen drawer and there were dead rats in her kitchen towels. Then she dealt with her beloved son going through cancer and the thought of him not getting well took up all her energy. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, her husband was going to leave her for one of his co-workers. Lynne\u2019s perfect exterior couldn\u2019t cope with real life and this took her mentally down. She told me divorce was out of the question, being the perfect Catholic.<br /><br />Lynne loved our Barbie Doings at The Bain Cabin and at each other\u2019s homes. Whenever it was her turn to have us over at her home, she told me, Don wouldn\u2019t approve, as all our entertaining is for his or our friends, not mine. She lived a life for others, never for herself. She loved being the perfect mom more than anything. I often wonder if any of her family ever knew the real Lynne that I knew, imperfect, frightened of everything. The book itself would make Lynne eternally sad to hang all her dirty laundry out for everyone to see. Her image of perfection was what she lived for. Lynne was so proud of her cooking skills, and I can still see her eating her famous potato salad at our Barbie meeting at the Bain Cabin. How she loved the compliments. Lynne was a very fragile, wonderful, fun friend whose perfect exterior hid the frightened little girl inside.

I mean seriously they wandered around and just sort of happened upon things that started to make sense within the case. Leaphorn was more worried about his wife (rightfully so) then he was about actually catching a murderer on the reservation. Chee felt like that only truly intelligent character and yet very little time felt like it was spent on him as a police officer. The pacing was so slow I actively went out of my way to find other things to do rather then read. I almost had to bribe myself to even finish 15 pages a night so I could finish the book before my book club met up to discuss it.<br /><br />Of the entire 216 pages only the last 25 or so were actually something I enjoyed. I only enjoyed the last 10% of the book because it was the only part where things actually happened and the \"police\" (I use that term very loosely in this as they were mostly just lucky and not actually good at their jobs) managed to mostly figure out what was going on. We won't talk about the fact that they weren't even the ones to take down the bad guy because that just felt like a low blow from the author. We also won't discuss the fact that said bad guy was mentioned a total of around 10 by name. We met the person once and then BOOM, the bomb is dropped that they are the bad guy.

Between the actual writing, the pacing, and the extraordinarily poor characters I can honestly say I will not be picking up another Tony Hillerman book in the future. Even though technically this is book seven in the series I didn't feel like I was missing any vital information, other then who the lady Chee kept mentioning, was. I felt like everything could be read on it's own and for that I am thankful.<br /><br />Check out more reviews on beautyandthebookwormonline.wordpress.com", "images": [], "asin": "0060156953", "parent_asin": "0060156953", "user_id": "AFFF32HIHB6453ZCLBGTUFSH353A", "timestamp": 1543612218965, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Sadly, overall, this much anticipated tale seemed forced and flat", "text": "This was my second attempt to finish Dr. Sleep, which I did this time around.  The first time I tried, when it was released, I was uninterested in the plot and its characters, so I put it away when I reached the halfway mark.  On this second attempt, I started again from the beginning and  I discovered that the 2nd half is much more interesting and faster-paced than the 1st half.<br /><br />I won't give spoilers here, but I will reveal why a 3-star review.  It is a high D or low C on a grading scale, for me.  I don't particularly find Dan Torrence\u2019s adult story engaging; it is really just kind of boring. Dan has his life struggles, most of which have resulted from his father's alcoholism and Overlook possession-there are lots of personal internal and external conflicts and demons Dan needs to trap, yet he is a boring guy, so the story is not too engaging in the first half of the story.<br /><br />OK, time for some MILD SPOILERS: Additionally, I didn\u2019t find the antagonists (the True Knot) really menacing/threatening (I kind of envision them as a band of roving decaying circus vampires); King made the heroine too strong for the True Knot. The situations and conflicts created by the True Knot should be suspenseful, but I never felt tension with the telepathic battles. Many times,  I just wanted the story to be over, faster.  I think that this would have made a good novella. There were just too many pages that could have been ripped out and still not affected the continuity of the story.  In fact, a tighter story may have engaged readers more successfully. But maybe not...<br /><br />The book has its moments that drew me in and flowed well (and this was mainly in the 2nd half), but overall, this was a story that did not give this Shining fan any satisfaction.<br /><br />In the end, I was really interested in looking into the lives of Danny and Wendy and Doc once again, and now, after reading Dr. Sleep, I wish I would have left the sleeping giant slumber.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1TwezKcp7S._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1TwezKcp7S._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1TwezKcp7S._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "1982131802", "parent_asin": "1982131802", "user_id": "AFVULAE3WDPTR54GZLWBNAG22RMA", "timestamp": 1622303386108, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not Completely Grounded", "text": "\"No hobby cases, Harry.\"<br /><br />That's the message from Cliff O'Toole, the new lieutenant heading up the Open-Unsolved Unit. O'Toole thinks Bosch is overly fixated on a murder case that started during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, twenty years ago.<br /><br />Says O'Toole: \"You are the worst kind of police officer, Bosch. You are arrogant, you are a bully, and you think the laws and regulations simply don't apply to you. I'm not the first to attempt to rid this department of you. But I will be the last.\"<br /><br />Bosch, of course, put the T in tenacious and he'll even go ahead and take a `vacation' to pursue a lead. Harry Bosch has a bullet casing--a bullet casing found near the body of a female photojournalist who was murdered in an alley and now, given the intervening two decades, Bosch can put it under more scrutiny with new technology at his disposal. And he has personal motivation. Bosch had been one of the cops to find the body during the riots.<br /><br />Bosch struggles for space and freedom to pursue his instincts against the grain of police bureaucracy. Bosch follows every single scrap of evidence like the master sleuth we admire, blowing through apparent dead ends and seeing things that others have not.<br /><br />Bosch is pursuing the \"one thing that brings it all together and makes sense of things. You find it and you're gold.\"<br /><br />For the most part, \"The Black Box\" works. Bosch follows the victim's past and starts making links to a moment on a cruise ship that was used for R & R for soldiers in the Gulf War.<br /><br />For me, several things didn't quite click. I didn't think O'Toole's anger at Bosch was warranted. Bosch's alleged crimes within department rules seemed relatively minor. Yes, he wandered slightly outside of protocol, but his steps didn't seem to justify putting a fellow cop out on the street to trail Bosch--a cop who plays a critical role in coming to Bosch's aid at the end. And once Bosch follows his leads up to central California, I had the feeling that Connelly wanted Harry Bosch to teach Jack Reacher a thing or two about toughness and guile. The Hollywood-esque ending felt a bit over-the-top.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is one of the best at breaking down a case, figuring things out, asking questions, pursuing every angle and, of course, never giving up. He's also a rogue cop, albeit a rogue with heart. \"The Black Box\" is a good read but I wish the climax had its feet as firmly on the ground as the first four-fifths of the story.", "images": [], "asin": "0316069434", "parent_asin": "0316069434", "user_id": "AEYFCXNFRVL5ISYTH7AO2CZH4WZQ", "timestamp": 1355666178000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "What took him so long?", "text": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK!<br />This is an interesting book.  I enjoyed reading it because it chronicles one of America's greatest music groups, and shows what went on behind the scenes of that perfection machine known as The Eagles.  Granted, that inside glimpse comes from Felder's perspective, but it is the only expose` I have read that shines some light on the dysfunction within this group.<br /><br />Felder tells of his humble beginnings in Gainesville, Florida; his growing love of music; the sibling rivalry caused by being compared to his brother; and his own reckless behavior that caused a long-lasting rift with his parents.<br /><br />He was complimentary of his fellow band-mates, quick to give praise to the musicians who helped him get his start in the music industry.  He even admitted to his personal failings while touring on the road.  It is not every man who can stand up and tell the world that he drank, did drugs and cheated on his wife.  One thing came through clearly and repeatedly as he told his story, Don Felder did love his wife Susan and their four children. Having said that, I wondered about Felder's cavalier attitude in explaining away his behavior.<br /><br />It was mildly annoying that when speaking of Don Henley and Glenn Frye, they were always referred to as \"The Gods.\"  I found it self-aggrandizing that Felder constantly patted himself on the back for his accomplishments; but this is, after all, his biography.  It was difficult to read about his emotional weakness at the time Henley and Frey ended his partnership with the Eagles.<br /><br />The manner in which Felder informed his wife that their marriage was over was disturbing. The fact that he found a girlfriend before either he or his wife had filed for divorce, was more than a minor character flaw.  I will always love the music of the Eagles. I have Felder's album \"Airborne,\" and I think he is a gifted musician; but this book truly changed my opinion of Don Felder the man.<br /><br />The reader never gets to the truth behind the title of the book until it nears its conclusion, by then I asked myself what took him so long.", "images": [], "asin": "0470450428", "parent_asin": "0470450428", "user_id": "AHNVHDN7XDCNRF7GZTDNLSABU5OQ", "timestamp": 1283113914000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false}

Author Hunter borrows and invents words like \"Mentat\" and \"I-filters\" to describe mundane, everyday concepts. Mentat is taken from Frank Herberts \"Dune\": a Mentat is essentially a human computer. The bottom line is that we rely on others to help us in reaching decisions and - surprise - those others may not have our best interests at heart and may, in fact, be using our \"secrets\", like our music preferences, to influence our decisions.<br /><br />  This is not news.<br /><br />  Hunter not only likes movies, he draws life lessons from them. There are dozens of references to movies in this book.<br /><br />  Hunter has a few schmaltzy rules that he has created, like \"When everything is known, no one knows everything.\" Ponder that. But don't expect to get paid for it.<br /><br />  Ultimately this wandering book of nostrums, recycled newspaper stories and references to Hollywood movies as sources of wisdom comes down to a muffled sales pitch for Gartner, \"the world's largest technology research firm.\" \"Lots of systems administrators aren't taking these basic steps now, and that's a prime reason why their systems get cracked.\" But fear not is the implied message, Gartner can help save you! \"Any credible vulnerability assessment will find two out of three Web servers connected to the Internet are vulnerable to simple attacks that can ar least result in changing the contenrt of the Web server,\" my Gartner colleague said . . .

It is obvious that they have paid attention to the details and are trying to put together the most plausible explanation of how life might have been in the transition from the last ice age. The people live in clans and are dependent upon each other for survival. They struggled for leadership just as any other group of humans and fought over the viability for the best ideas of survival. They fought change, they tried hard to maintain their contact with the spiritual side of existence and they were deeply respectful of life.<br />We follow the mammoth hunters as they struggle for survival during the stress of &quot;others&quot; forcing them from their normal hunting grounds and camps. They struggle with the balance of peaceful coexistence and warring to protect the life they know. And then they face the incredible challenge of going against all their accumulated knowledge to follow Wolf Dreamer under the ice to a new land. In many ways, this is a perfect &quot;Campbell hero story&quot; and as such, is inspiring, interesting, and has lessons for us even in this far removed time. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.", "images": [], "asin": "0812521331", "parent_asin": "0812521331", "user_id": "AE5WP6EZJSAAQ7625S3XDV46GYQQ", "timestamp": 997373613000, "helpful_vote": 22, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Great idea, poor execution", "text": "I received this book from the LibraryThing.com Member Giveaway.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. The book summary sounded intriguing: a story about an ancient Celtic treasure in the time before the Arthurian legends. The author's note indicated that the book had been painstakingly researched, even though it was fiction. I usually LOVE this type of book - right up my alley! However, the language of the book detracted so much from the story that it was laborious to read. The writing was, at times, stilted, other times, just awkward. At times, I felt I was reading a book that had been written in another language and then poorly translated to English. Other times, it just felt like there had been little effort in the editing - grammatically, there were split infinitives, sentences ending with prepositions, subject/noun agreement, and distracting passive voice. Typographically, there were distracting misspellings (for example: 'dessert' instead of 'desert' and the non-word, \"drunkened\" as in (p237) \"...drunkened with the sensuous craving....\").<br /><br />Some of what bothered me may have been mere stylistic choice - I am not fond of the overuse of inanimate objects taking actions - throughout the book, faces hovered, swords launched, daggers propelled, and on p192 a \"thump bounced around inside the house and they turned towards it.\" Other descriptive terms were awkward, as well - there was a description of a \"tender thud\", and while I understand that there are many authors that use the phrases, \"he embraced her to him\" and \"he curled his mouth\" turn me off. Also, every other expression of good humor was described as \"light\" - the characters laugh lightly, chuckle lightly, smile lightly - I think once, someone even frowned lightly. Sometimes it just felt like the wrong word was chosen from the thesaurus.<br /><br />The story itself was rather entertaining, however I figured out the male lead's secret about 1/3 of the way through the book and spent the rest of the book wondering why the female lead was so dense. I felt the book did not have much in the way of character development, and I did not feel drawn to any of the characters. This felt more like a romance novel that happens to be set in Dark Ages Britain than a story about Dark Ages Britain that happens to have some romance.", "images": [], "asin": "0966037103", "parent_asin": "0966037103", "user_id": "AHUZIFVMEWUQPVQRBO6KIHOR4G3Q", "timestamp": 1264555976000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Both sections are terribly light, with basic instructions but lacking the kind of depth or detail that other art books often offer. This is especially true of the section about creating comics, which is generic in its content--it really repeats basic comic advice that can be had in a dozen other books, without offering anything new.<br /><br />The software itself (a trial comes with the book) seems an awful lot like Photoshop with a lot of preset custom brushes and such, but then lacking the versatility that PS offers to do more than Manga.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Kim goes all-in for God on a Mission Trip", "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect from Found in Translation, all I remembered about the book was that it was a Christian YA novel. Anything else had been forgotten as it had been sitting on my kindle for so long. Too long that it is now actually considered to be out of print. This book starts with Kim heading to Mexico for a mission trip. However, from the get-go it seems that this trip is cursed for her and that Satan is tempting her to quit. From missed emails to wrong clothes. From the get-go, Kim is being tempted to quit and take the easy road and has been given many opportunities to bow out. However, Kim is determined to prove those who have ridiculed her wrong and that she is ready to spread god's word to those who need to hear it. Kim and the rest of the group arrive in a small Mexican village that has been ravaged by tragedy. During the book, Kim meets a wide variety of different characters and makes a collection of friends and frenemies. My favorite part of this book was the relationship that Kim had with a little Mexican girl who others teased and told was cursed. The little girl attached herself to Kim and as they were both one-armed, they worked together. This part reminded me of my What If ? plan that I have always had, if I wasn't in a relationship- I have always said I would go overseas and work in an orphanage with the children and be there with them as I would find that challenging but rewarding. The other thing at the time of reading this book was that I could relate to Kim with her broken arm as while reading this book I too was recovering from a broken wrist.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "California weird approach to organization", "text": "Liz Franklin bills herself as a \"Cubicle Anthropologist\". She strikes me as just another Californian with a weird approach to a simple topic: keeping clutter out of your life.<br /><br />  Franklin calls herself a humorist - and there is what appears to be a definite attempt to emulate the late Erma Bombeck and the still-very-much-alive Scott Adams. But it is a poor imitation of both.<br /><br />  Franklin makes up her own categories for people: \"sparklebrains\", \"linears\" and \"cross-dominants\", each of whom gets their own symbol. Then she divides them into \"spatials\", \"visuals\" and \"chronologicals\", each of which style also gets its own symbol. Simple, isn't it? This explains why you live in a clutter.<br /><br />  However, the space ship needs to make a stop to explain \"synesthesia\", people who associate words, objects and events with sounds, colors and smells. They can see vowels glow or smell words. If real, very, very few people have this trait, but like a child with a new grown-up word, Franklin spends pages on synthesetes. She even includes a test with questions like \"[h]ow does a three smell?\" and \"[w]hat flavor is June?\".<br /><br />  When Franklin returns from orbit, she gets to the real business: handling paperwork. Yes: paperwork. Though the book was published in 2003, Franklin doesn't touch the subject of electronic data. Weird.<br /><br />  Silliness abounds. Franklin tries to be brilliant, so she offers advice like \"verbing\" your tasks. Don't use nouns, use verbs. Of course, Franklin begins this section with a mistake: she fails to recognize that (at one time) \"Xerox\" was often used as a verb in addition to being used as a noun. She trumpets her great discovery: \"Changing nouns to verbs is one of the secret tricks to making paper flow smoothly. The old nouns we used kept things in the past; now verbs move them into the future. Verbs are what motivate us to get things done.\" So just get into the habit of \"verbing\" everything and life will be fine. You bet. And don't forget to put things in verbed and non-verbed stacks!<br /><br />  Franklin is big on what strike me as juvenile word games. For example, \"soonering\" your to-dos is a way to get things done on time. If you have something due on the 15th, \"sooner\" your to-do for an earlier date so you'll have time to do the work. I am not joking: this is in the book.<br /><br />  Overall, I found this book silly. There is, of course, the pitch for Franklin to come in and organize your life.

Overall, I think I can say that the writing is done well, some forced metaphors, allusions in the first couple of stories, but after that, solid command of the language. What it left me with was that the stories just didn't hook me.  There did not seem to be much \"new\" in regards to their content (tornado, earthquake, plane crash, alien invasion) except when you get to the ending of each story.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Tedious Account of Boston Mob Boss' Trial", "text": "As author T.J. English observes in the Introduction, WHERE THE BODIES WERE BURIED is \"an account of the trial of Whitey Bulger from a particular point of view.\"  That point of view is, basically, outrage against the government law enforcement system that recruited a notorious Boston mob boss like Bulger as a \"Top Echelon\" informant, and protected him from prosecution for many years, despite his ongoing criminal activities (including murders, sex with underage girls, drug trafficking, and racketeering).<br /><br />English \"attended every minute and every day of the trial,\" and recounts the daily events in detail, in chronological order.  Thus he successfully captures the tedium of every long criminal trial.  The author's desire to see the full scandal of the FBI's unfortunate involvement with Bulger \"laid bare\" is admirable, but the scandal itself isn't all that interesting if you haven't heard of Bulger and his crimes before picking up this book.<br /><br />WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED represents a lot of research (through interviews with witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and former federal agents), and is reasonably well-written.  However, as one more reporter's eyewitness account of a famous criminal trial, it's boring.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good start", "text": "I hoped to really like this; my favorite kind of non-fiction is a history that takes something about which the received wisdom is rather straightforward and shows how much more complex it is. Books I have praised in other reviews, \"Dark Horse\" and \"Big Trouble\" described some small and obscure events in such a way as to astonish and delight. If I ever have to whittle my library down to 10 books, these two will remain.<br /><br />Not so \"Dead Last.\" Part of the problem is that Harding just wasn't an impressive guy. Genial, kindly and nondescript, he seems to have been a fellow who got along and wanted to do well for his town, his state and his country. But he had some character flaws that made him a poor judge of character and he allowed his desire for young, pretty women to get the better of him. The country that came to train tracks to watch his coffin ride by was, just a few months later, done with him. Bumbling Warren, tumbled to the bottom of the list.<br /><br />But the question is not how, but why? Why did an era that worshiped sex and money and alcohol, exemplified by the blazing couple of the 20s, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, so despise WGH? Was it merely that they didn't like the idea of old people sharing their fun? Was there more? Was it the intelligentsia's abhorrence of the small town boosterish middle class? Or his not using the \"best minds\" which has been such a recurring theme in leftist politics for a century? This was an era of a frenzied press seeking to sell papers, so stories of seedy assignations would be front page news. And spiritualism was everywhere as well; even Coolidge tried to communicate with his dead son. These were big ingredients in the 20s stew, but were never addressed. Just too much context was not captured to explain how he fell so far so fast.<br /><br />In reading much history it has always seemed to me the historical categories are defined not by any stark lines but by deciding first whom we want in and then writing our categories to fit those preconceptions. Well, we want Kennedy to be a glorious President, so we have to carefully define what he did as great and blow off the things that don't fit. (Rape? Really? You can be a rapist and pimp and be a great President?) Likewise, stuffy, stodgy Harding, opposed to the Progressive agenda, must be a bad guy, so historians, not seeking truth but seeking vindication, labor diligently to fit him into this department. And the one word line, serial philanderer and leader of thieves, is all anyone needs to know.<br /><br />Now Harding made it easy, but historians want big men who try big things, and they become great,. Wilson. Roosevelt one and two. Kennedy. Johnson. And the scowling meanies like Nixon can never become great, because they are on the bad team. Nothing Nixon did could ever vindicate him, nothing Kennedy did could ever tarnish him. (I fear we may be in a similar situation today, with historians working as hard as Pravda ever did to apologize for and excuse their man.)<br /><br />This \"Why\" is an interesting question, one I wish had been explored here, but was not. And so the author wanders all over (in rather doggy prose) discussing how Marion and Florence and his friends tried to protect Harding's reputation and in doing so allowed it to sink even further.

Her father, Gabriel, contemptuous and terrifying. When she's 18, Meridia meets Daniel, and the love is instant. Against the wishes of her father and his mother, they marry. His mother, Eva, is a harridan. Meridia and Daniel spend a great deal of energy trying to deflect, ignore and postpone Eva's rages.<br /><br />The difference, in \"Of Bees and Mist\", is that their world has more magic than ours, for good and ill. Not wave-your-wand magic, but mists that make you disappear, coincidences that pop like firecrackers, happiness that turns you into a ghost. And most of all - the bees. This imagery is riveting: When Eva wants her way, she needles and shouts and sends her bees. They surround you, sting you, enter your ears and your mouth, all the while furiously buzzing - stinging your mind as well as your body.<br /><br />The bees imagery is what saves this book. As a metaphor for the cruelty of unmitigated and virulent nagging, it is brilliant.<br /><br />What leads me to give \"Of Bees and Mist\" 3.2 stars, rounded down to 3, is that it is 404 pages of repetition. What new evil can Eva devise? What new subterfuge can Meridia propose. Who will be the next to wilt and rot?

The plot may have seemed a bit convoluted and possibly a bit coincidental until the story truly found its direction. But the jokes were there, and so was the entertainment value, and so was the group of pranksters that staggered across the page.

While not really a chronicle of the events that led up to his fathers death, this book serves as more of a journal for Finn, a place for him to express what is running through his head and heart.<br />Finn is a quirky young man, interested in the meaning of names, odd facts about bugs, and sharp observations on his feelings, his friend Melani, and how his brother and mom are plodding along after so much has changed.<br />The author has nailed the mindset of a greiving tween head on, and I have a new respect for those kids caught in the aftermath of a parents death, desertion, or even divorce.  Finn goes through the stages of grief and comes to a realization at the end of the novel that is fitting and brings home the point of why Finn likes what names mean and how its interestig to collect those little nuggets of wisdom.<br />A book that is well done, but does have a bit of lag time in the middle.  Thankfully, Finn gives us his permission to set the book aside and pick it up later when you feel like it.

His faux exegesis of &#34;Sunday Morning&#34; misses the point entirely.  Instead of explicating the poem carefully Mr Bloom spouts out Platonic philosophy, failing of course to connect it to the poem itself.

The best of the lot, in my opinion, is still the first, &#34;Killer Angels,&#34; on Gettysburg and  which won the Pulitzer. &#34;The Fateful Lightning&#34; is the final book in a four book series on the war in the west, and in the interest of transparency I admit to not having read the previous books. But it suffers from what I see as some of the characteristics that make reading a Shaara book such a chore...it is huge at over 600 pages and would have benefited from being reduced to half that length, and the cast of characters is equally huge. It has the usual mix of real people (Sherman, Joe Johnson) and the fictional in the person of the enslaved Franklin. It gave a fairly balanced look at Sherman, who continues to be a byword in the South to this day for many. All one need do is to access any Civil War website, particularly on Facebook, and you will read claims that Sherman, or at least some of his men, did everything except eat a baby...As a descendant of Union veterans, including one great grand uncle who marched with Sherman, I have a different view.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "6 yr old loved the book!", "text": "Bought this for a 6 yr old and she loved it!, especially the journey of the tree through the seasons and the apple pie recipe at the end, that family gave it 5 stars. My son would have considered this book ok though, I don't think he would have fallen in love with it, he read another apple theme book as a toddler, meant for slightly younger kids, that he loves. The plus point of this book is that it covers a lot of information subtly-the life cycle of an apple tree along with a side track of a robin family nesting on it. Like some of the reviewers, I too feel that the illustrations could have been better (they are kind of colorful but could have been cuter, with more fall colors while showing that season), and I also feel that apart from being very informative, the language could have been more engaging to read. I reduced the 2 stars for the average illustrations and the bland writing style, still worth a buy if you find it cheap(used copies), for the wealth of information it gives within the simple story. The book is too pricey brand new so I got a used one.<br />Recommended age 4-7 yrs. Below 4 yrs is definitely too young to actually notice and understand all the processes this book teaches.

It was recommended from another purchase I made on Amazon and the reviews are so great!  I was underwhelmed by this book because I felt like I got nothing out of it.  I love motivational content that reinforces how strong, powerful, and capable women and entrepreneurs can be but the book is mainly Rachel's personal stories as evidence of those motivational concepts.  I admire how open and honest she is about her personal life but it wasn't worth the cost of the book to read.  Since I wasn't familiar with Rachel prior to this book I did not realize how much religion is a part of her brand.  I'm not disappointed or upset with her brand and how she presents herself, but I don't tend to agree with the idea that a Creator leads people to the right paths and decisions about their lives and businesses.  Rachel brings up points like that several times in the book.  If you are a non-religious entrepreneur looking for encouragement and motivation to pursue your goals and be more confident about yourself you may be unsatisfied with this book since many of the stories lean heavily on religious beliefs.

Many of these are minor stories by name authors; see TOC link at first comment. One suspects the anthology was published so editor Mohan could pay the authors something. There are a few standout stories:<br /><br />* \"The Gauze Banner\", by Eleanor Arnason<br />A wry, amusing Hwarhath tale, never reprinted per ISFDB. Nominated for the 1998 Tiptree Award.  Worth seeking out, if you're an Arnason fan. And you should be  ;-]<br /><br />* \"The Experiment\", as by SN Dyer (Sharon N. Farber). Dark humor about two f-ckups in Vietnam, drafted into an LSD experiment back in the World. Entertaining but slight.<br /><br />* \"Visitors\", by Laurie A. Taylor.  Post-apocalypse visitors to a partially-functional automatic house, &agrave; la \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" by Ray Bradbury. Nice story;  grim, plausible ending.<br /><br />* \"Hardware Scenario G-49\" (1991), by James Alan Gardner. George, a kindly hardware-store manager, meets Diana, Goddess of the Hunt. Hijinks ensue. This is a  variant on the [[ASIN:1447403355 The Night Life of the Gods]] schtick, but the story that immediately came to mind  was Keith Roberts' wonderful \"Ariadne Potts\". Not quite in that class, but pretty darn good. This, the second of four reprints in the book, was also reprinted  in Gardner's 2005 Gravity Wells collection.<br /><br />* \"Unchosen Love\" (1994), a Hainish story by Ursula K. Le Guin. This well-received story was nominated for three major awards, and has been reprinted three times, most recently in a third edition of The Birthday of the World and Other Stories (2010).

It is one of my favorite genres. I have read little about France and was interested in this story. The very first chapter threw me off as it contains french words that I could not define (despite trying). As a result I did not know what was being said.<br />Chapter two was much easier and not so much use of French words. I actually got very interested in the story and read like crazy at that point. Then at about 23% or so you lost me again with lots of French words and dialogue that it was sometimes hard to tell who was talking to whom.<br />It's obviously well researched and the author is knowledgeable but it just lacks the ability for fairly simple digestion by the reader.

If you're looking to be carried along by silken prose, you'd be better served looking elsewhere.<br /><br />What I liked about the book: lots of information.  I enjoyed reading about a cowboy's relationship with his horse, and reading actual examples of tombstone inscriptions that were placed on those few horses that made such an impact in life that in death they deserved not only burial but a marker with an inscription.  I enjoyed reading the story about the traveler at the train depot hearing good news, and how a nearby group of cowboys - upon overhearing the man's good news - suddenly raised a ruckus simply to help the man celebrate.  I enjoyed reading how important a cowboy's hat and saddle were, the detailed descriptions of his gear, his gait, and the physical deformities he suffered from a lifetime riding a horse - even riding a horse, rather than walking, when no more than 200 yards separated the cowboy from his destination.<br /><br />What I did not like about the book: Most of it reads like this (or worse): \"Associated with these men, obedient to their leadership, taking color from them, and so also a factor in formulating the social and political system of the Range were such of the cowboy's fellow employees as, not being cowboys, were therefore of a station more humble than he was.\"  Sentences are unnecessarily cumbersome, and frequently I had to stop and re-read sentences or entire paragraphs in order to get it.  I understand the book was written 80 years ago, but I'm not accustomed to reading this style of writing.  The author also used quotes excessively.  He often made sentences using the words of the time, but he quoted every word which I found very distracting being that it occurred page after page, chapter after chapter.  In addition, there's no story here, no evolution of learning, no sense of being carried through time or of having a picture of cowboy life magically painted before your eyes.  It read more like a shopping list: Cowboy gear was: item 1, item 2, item 3.  Cowboy personality was: item 1, item 2, item 3.  And so on.<br /><br />The bottom line for me was that it was good information but, to be quite honest, I often found it hard to stay awake and generally could only manage half a chapter before I had to put it down and do something else.

Once I yelled loudly \"I hate him!\" This is NOT romance, love, or even lust. This is abuse. Many times Rhydon hurts Sallie by grabbing her wrists, and \"crushing\" her with kisses. What made me the most angry was how manipulative he was, how mocking, sneering and uncaring he was towards her. Yet she always puts up with it and surrenders to him so fast, it's maddening.<br /><br />He takes away everything she loves, grounds her from traveling and doing her job, basically pinning her in, and she knows it! She just succumbs to it. No career anymore? No excitement? No problem!<br /><br />Not only that, but several times he tells her to \"shut up!\" and calls her a fool. Several times she knows she's in danger because of his temper, the look in his eyes, and he threatens her many times, even threatening her that he knows a lot of people and she'll never work in this town again! Does that sound like love or romance to you? She barely makes a whimper when he takes everything away from her!<br /><br />I shudder to think what kind of young girl I was 30 years ago that thought this was an excellent book.

I never heard of Vanishing Twin Syndrome until today and learned something new yet again!<br />This character shines with her faith and despite tragic circumstances, finds the will to go on. Beth is not perfect by all means but I sympathized all heartily with her reactions particularly as she deals with her mother's lack of sensitivity.<br />Beth' strength, her determination to survive and to find joy around her, her willingness to forgive makes her beautiful, a true Christian.<br /><br />On the other end, you have Suzanne, her mother. She too is hit by tragic circumstances beyond her control, but has little faith and is emotionally dependent on others.<br />I think I disliked this character from the moment she denied comfort to her daughter, thinking instead of her own need. It does not stop there either and I found myself hard put to be charitable.<br />Despite my wish to be fair and not to judge, I found myself wondering how a mother could simply walk out on her child and use emotional baggage to justify her attitude.<br /><br />Perhaps the plot line was to effectively balance the weakness and the strength in both main protagonists, highlighting Christian compassion and forgiveness as shown in sub characters as well.<br /><br />My feelings were however ambivalent and in the end, I wish I could have cut the book in two and made it just Beth's story...<br /><br />3 Stars.<br /><br />Thank you to Christina and Sherrie for the gift of the Ebook!

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "This historic opus of horrors is dull and boring", "text": "This historic opus of horrors is dull and boring, despite the subversive and gruesome subject matter. Admittedly, the S&M scenes ARE still often stomach-turning and blasphemous; however, the author writes in an inventive style of his own which, frankly, puts each scene on the page with such nebulous and confusingly unique grammar that it makes the reading of this 'classic' a chore (originally written in French, there are four English translations - I liked this one best of the two I read). However, although individual sentences often sing with glory, even in translation, and some particular nightmarish descriptions of the narrator's activities have apparently sent generations of readers into ecstatic creative productions of Surreal Art, the only reason for anyone to attempt reading this book would be out of curiosity or for a Literature class. It is strictly a 'History of the Novel' read.<br /><br />If googled, there is a lot of expert guessing about the author and his purpose in writing this unique book - was it transformed from real events or was it all imagination? The horror stories we see now every day on cable television, with vivid graphic gore commonplace and accessible to us sitting in our living-rooms would only be known to Ducasse either through conversation, pictures, books or having seen or done something similar in real life, in my opinion. I think this book is the work of a juvenile, or perhaps a schizophrenic, mind - intelligent and educated, but juvenile, a young man playing at being a 19th-century male goth; or he was simply unable to control the fantasies and images which may have been assaulting him. I think it is possible the author actually did some of these things (in a manner with no fantasy elements) or saw them done. Heavy use of alcohol-drugs give a schizophrenic or psychotic madness to thoughts and dreams, too. I was sure that the author had to be in bad health when he wrote this; when I read his bio (what there is), apparently it may have been as bad as I guessed - even if he only starved to death from Napoleon's war - but I suspect he was diseased as well. Syphilis, perhaps? In any case, he died at age 24.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />&#34;&#34;Ducasse was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, to Fran\u00e7ois Ducasse, a French consular officer, and his wife Jacquette-C\u00e9lestine Davezac. Very little is known about Isidore's childhood, except that he was baptized on 16 November 1847 in the cathedral of Montevideo and that his mother died soon afterwards, probably due to an epidemic. In 1851, as a five-year-old, he experienced the end of the eight-year Siege of Montevideo in the Argentine-Uruguayan War. He was brought up to speak three languages: French, Spanish and English.<br /><br />In October 1859, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to high school in France by his father. He was trained in French education and technology at the Imperial Lyc\u00e9e in Tarbes. In 1863 he enrolled in the Lyc\u00e9e Louis Barthou in Pau, where he attended classes in rhetoric and philosophy (under and uppergreat). He excelled at arithmetic and drawing and showed extravagance in his thinking and style. Isidore was a reader of Edgar Allan Poe and particularly favored Percy Bysshe Shelley and Byron, as well as Adam Mickiewicz, Milton, Robert Southey, Alfred de Musset and Baudelaire. During school he was fascinated by Racine and Corneille, and by the scene of the blinding in Sophocles' Oedipus the King. According to his schoolmate Paul Lesp\u00e8s, he displayed obvious folly &#34;by self-indulgent use of adjectives and an accumulation of terrible death images&#34; in an essay. After graduation he lived in Tarbes, where he started a friendship with Georges Dazet, the son of his guardian, and decided to become a writer.<br /><br />After a brief stay with his father in Montevideo, Ducasse settled in Paris at the end of 1867. He began studies at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, only to abandon them one year later. Continuous allowances from his father made it possible for Ducasse to dedicate himself completely to his writing. He lived in the &#34;Intellectual Quarter&#34;, in a hotel in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, where he worked intensely on the first canto of Les Chants de Maldoror. It is possible that he started this work before his passage to Montevideo, and also continued the work during his ocean journey.<br /><br />Ducasse was a frequent visitor to nearby libraries, where he read Romantic literature, as well as scientific works and encyclopaedias. The publisher L\u00e9on Genonceaux described him as a &#34;large, dark, young man, beardless, mercurial, neat and industrious&#34;, and reported that Ducasse wrote &#34;only at night, sitting at his piano, declaiming wildly while striking the keys, and hammering out ever new verses to the sounds&#34;.<br /><br />In late 1868, Ducasse published (anonymously and at his own expense) the first canto of Les Chants de Maldoror a booklet of thirty-two pages which is considered by many to be a bold, taboo-defying poem concerning pain and cruelty.&#34;&#34;<br /><br />The above information is from the following Wikipedia article: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comte_...<br /><br />The historical record explains this book enchanted many artists who later read this book. Presto! The Surrealist Movement was born!<br />The below quote from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Surrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont, and for the line &#34;beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella&#34;, and Arthur Rimbaud, two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.&#34;<br /><br />Many Literature readers and literary critics of ancient Canon Great Books love these intelligent, talented, drugged-out alcoholic, usually male (millennia of prejudice meant women were often forbidden to read anything but their religious books, if they could read at all) writers of genius whose real lifestyle invariably involves abuse of wives and children and prostitutes, while living in decrepit attics with filth on the floors-walls and insects crawling on them in their stupefied sleep, starving from having spent whatever cash they had on alcohol/drugs. Some of these authors ARE very good, and worthy of being respected as great writers (if not family guys), but others seem to have become totally psychotic and took up a pen while blitzed or having an episode of mental derangement. The world of mostly male Literature experts applaud wildly and buys every copy printed. Is it of value? Reluctantly, I say yes. At worst we females gain insight to the male mind. At best, some really wonderful books are written.<br /><br />But this isn't one of those.<br /><br />I think Ducasse appropriated the style of writing from the Revelations book in the Bible, but he wrote from a Lucifer follower's viewpoint, and placed his nightmarish scenes (dreams?) in his contemporary Paris, along with including particularly revolting religious imagery with the idea perhaps of creatively and satirically attempting to toss writing conventions (particularly in the grammar rules which identify the subject, i.e. 'I, you, me, they', so that there is a struggle by the reader to understand which narrator is speaking) and social mores of decency out the window. I understand the intellectual point of this. I can imagine the shock of a 19th century reader. However, for a 21st century reader, this book is a tremendous bore. I think there are lots of satirical transformations of other authors' philosophical writings and stories included (I saw references on the Net from experts who say that Ducasse stole entire sections of material, verbatim, from other books of the time.", "images": [], "asin": "0982046480", "parent_asin": "0982046480", "user_id": "AH35PYPHPOU3AZKZPC46ANU7NAGA", "timestamp": 1429953047000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "3 1/2 Stars - Hit and Miss", "text": "Hit and Miss<br /><br />I went into this book as a player of SWTOR and a fan of the lore. I had modest expectations and in some ways it greatly surpassed them while in others it fell short. I'd like to start with the strongest point of the book though, the main character, Theron Shan.<br /><br />Theron is a rather interesting main character and he has a unique perspective on the things that take place around him. He has history with the Jedi even though he isn't a force user himself and is knowledgable on their beliefs and practices though he doesnt follow them. Theron displays this by often going from cynical and indulgent about things such as the force to naive and idealistic on matters of state and the war. That being said, this is such a good main character. Regardless of his views on things he is very analytical and is written in a way where you can really understand what he is thinking as he acquires more information. I always thought the Republic SIS (the republic's covert spy and operations network) was underused in the old Republic era lore and this really adds some nice flavor and depth to their agents and operations. That being said, Theron also has a bit of a backstory with Grand Master of the Jedi Satele Shan and Supreme Republic Commander Jace Malcom and this is where it starts to become more of a mixed bag as the story that is included often feels tacked on for dramatic effect or is just awkward.<br /><br />There are more characters than Theron, Satele, and Jace though, and these characters often feel flat and uninteresting even when you want to feel otherwise. Theron has a female Twilek friend in a criminal gang that he often goes out of his way for and seems to really care for from his youth and his past with the Jedi. However, nothing ever really comes from or changes in<br />their odd relationship aside from her proving to be a useful contact later in the story. He is also accompanied by Master Gnost Dural whom some will remember from the SWTOR historical archives. He is a typical Jedi Master with the twist of the main villan being his former apprentice. He has little interest in saving her though and the only reason I cared about him was because of him being the same character who narrated the historical archives on the SWTOR website. He does his job as a Jedi well, but there is little depth or emotional connection to be had with his character. The villians are what you would expect from the Sith and, like Gnost Dural, they do their job without having any real depth or interest aside from the political machinations of the sith.<br /><br />Another thing that was nice in this book was being able to see the latest events in the Old Republic timeline and how the war between the Republic and Sith Empire was going in its latest incarnation. They throw you a bone with some glimpses of politics and comments pointing to the larger scope of the war but its nothign particulary in depth or substantial which I found a letdown and took away from the sense of scale and conflict. But in the end this is Therons story and all other devices<br />serve as a medium to tell it.<br /><br />It's a decent book in the Old Republic series and the character of Theron Shan is really the selling point of this book in my opinion. I would even like to see more SIS operations detailing new events in the war centered around his viewpoint or have him reappear as a supporting character in future peices of lore. But if you are looking for a good stand alone book that can really suck you into the Old Republic era I would give this a pass.", "images": [], "asin": "0345529413", "parent_asin": "0345529413", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1358988708000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

What I have liked about her other books are the non-stop action and the clever plot.  This book wasn't really a novel.  It's an editorial thinly wrapped in a story.  And the story plods.<br /><br />Ms. Sellers is using this book to press for decriminalizing drug use.  Her passion is so strong that I believe that she or someone very close to her spent some time in jail for drug possession.  When you are so passionate about an issue, I think you lose the perspective you need to write an interesting book.  For instance, the Amazon book description says that the main character is undercover but finds the group she's infiltrated to be sympathetic.  I don't think the writing in the story supported that contention.<br /><br />If you're considering this book as your first Sellers' story, I would select another one.  It isn't characteristic of her work.<br /><br />If you've looked at the other reviews, you can see that lots of people disagree with me.  If you feel as passionately as Ms. Sellers, you may like this book too because you'll be ardently agreeing with what she says and you won't notice that there is very little story.

This book reminded me of Zusak\u2019s Underdogs trilogy, probably because of the personality of the main character. I didn\u2019t really like those books, and I didn\u2019t really care for this story either.

I didn\u2019t dislike him either though. I did think the book\u2019s plot was smart. The ending was pretty great too, and although I should have guessed it, I didn\u2019t. But then the actual ending after the reveal was disappointing and left me with the obvious questions of who? I don\u2019t like not getting answers in my books.<br /><br />I like the message of this book: everyone is struggling with something and everyone needs help, and anyone can benefit and feel better after serving another.

In turn, the novel is divided into a 100+ very short chapters.  Alexander McCall Smith's intended audience was the Edinburgh newspaper readers who had to follow the novel on a daily basis.  Consequently, the novel is filled with insider references that Edinburgh readers would appreciate.  Afterall, it is always a little bit thrilling to see one's home town mentioned in a story.  All these inside references to neighborhoods and local politics are less interesting to a reader living in another country.<br /><br />I am a loyal fan of Alexander McCall Smith.  His Number One Ladies Detective Agency novels are subperb and the Professor Von Igelfeld stories are some of the funniest stories that I have ever read.  Unfortunately, McCall Smith does not deliver in this novel.  The story line is jagged and many interesting threads are never persued.  There are some very humorous moments but all in all the novel is strangely disjointed.<br /><br />Writing novels in daily or weekly chapters must be one of the most daunting tasks that any novelist can undertake.  Unfortunately, only the greatest writers can do this well.  Dumas and Dickens come to mind.  They were successful because they took on ambitious story lines with very wide scopes of detail and character.  McCall Smith fails in this novel because his scope is too narrow and pedestrian.  These small intimate Edinburgh stories are not made for daily newspaper deadlines.  Unfortunately, he could not realize this novel within the constraints of one newspaper column a day.  This would have been a much better novel, if he would have sat down and wrote it like a conventional novel.

Which, of course, is the main reason people would flock to so called \"evidence\" of \"intelligent design\".<br /><br />Darwin had the same initial reservations about his theory as most creationists have had ever since, but, he also dispelled them in a chapter written just for that purpose. You can go through his thought process with him as you read it. T. H. Huxley reportedly exclaimed \"How stupid not to have thought of it!\" in his excitement of reading it (he was Darwin's \"bulldog\" there after).<br /><br />Most, of the faithful, probably, don't get around to actually studying evolution.

One of the main objections is always this idea that evolutionists believe that life originated \"randomly\".<br /><br />Natural Selection is anything BUT random (though, not in need of supernatural forces either!). It accumulates over time - hardly difficult to understand. But, if you fear evolution - like so many faithful do, you're not likely to accept it anyway. :)<br /><br />Other fine books to look at are Dawkin's the Blind Watchmaker, and his recent missive the God Delusion.<br />Whether or not you believe, deny, or are on the boarder, the arguments are worth being aware of.<br /><br />As for this book, it's unnecessary. The God bias is clear, and the arguments OLD.<br /><br />Lastly, most creationists no matter their faith, assume that if they can SINK natural selection with some \"magic bullet\" that creationism will be the next obvious choice for how living organisms came about. They ridiculously imagine that there's only Natural selection and God as explanations.<br /><br />However, there are endless other less supernatural and MORE supernatural explanations than the faithful can begin to dispel.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "and I liked his voice and narrating on this book", "text": "\u201cJournal of an Outlaw\u201d is a satirical comedy written by Mick McArt giving the listener a view into the life of a rogue fantasy game character who finds himself in a land called the Unremembered Realms.\u00a0 The book is narrated by Faust Kells who has a few other fantasy type books performed under his name, and I liked his voice and narrating on this book.\u00a0 It was my first time listening to an audiobook by this narrator.\u00a0 If you like stories poking fun at not only other fantasy literature but also include such items as D&D, social media, along with many modern items, you may find the book enjoyable.\u00a0 For me, I found it to be too disjointed and the humor overall not very whimsical even with fantasy books being my favorite genre.\u00a0 I will say that I liked the artwork of the book\u2019s cover, it drew me into wanting to listen and learn who this odd character was.<br /><br />The book contains one-hundred and twenty (120) journal entries which the author says are not told in chronological order.\u00a0 Yet, many of the later records reference items from earlier sections and you can feel the progression as the book moves along.\u00a0 These journals entries are simply small vignettes, or snippets, where I would have preferred the story to be told in a more traditional fashion. Although there were a few times where I cracked a smile, I found the flow of the story to be difficult to follow and the humor felt forced and often crude in nature.\u00a0 \u00a0But, as a whole, the story was quite imaginative and unique in the way it was presented to the listener.\u00a0 It must have taken some time for the author to create all the various quips, puns, and pokes for the various events you will experience in the book.<br /><br />I liked that the author included many of the known fantasy tropes such as troll and even maintained their known weakness against such things as fire.\u00a0 He seemed quite knowledgeable in fantasy works.\u00a0 A few of the creatures were unique while others were what one expects generally to find in a book of this category.\u00a0 I enjoyed the scene with the gelatinous cube as I have myself faced such a creature in my own role-playing adventures.\u00a0 The characters themselves I found to be rather non-dimensional and flat.\u00a0 I understand that in a book consisting of only journal entries, you will not have a lot of narrative or backstory to fill in these important details.\u00a0 What you do learn of the main character, the author of the journal, is that he is quite the outlaw with very few morals.\u00a0 He is a rather selfish character who is always looking out for number one, even during battles.\u00a0 The audiobook has promise, I would have liked to have had more depth and complexity than simply all humor; understanding this was a piece of satire.<br /><br />The audiobook\u2019s narration was well done with only a few noticeable audio artifacts; mainly swallowing which was not edited out.\u00a0 Nothing that would prevent you from listening though.\u00a0 The volume of the book was consistent from the start to finish, and I do not recall any other issues with the audio itself.\u00a0 The narrator\u2019s voice was believable as the main character and even the other characters he voiced along the way.\u00a0 I look forward to hearing future narrated books to see if they are as well performed.<br /><br />For parents and younger readers, as the author himself says, the book is really intended to be listened to by adults.\u00a0 Yet, some of the gaming and fantasy humor will be picked up by younger readers, I think much of it will be over their heads.\u00a0 As stated earlier, some of the humor is rather crude and may not be suitable for younger readers.<br /><br />In summary, I liked the short chapters (journal entries) as it made consuming the book easier when large blocks of time could not be set aside for listening.\u00a0 I really wish this was told more in a traditional story with more depth and character development than it was.\u00a0 I think one can still have a fair amount of humor and satire told in a story more than the numerous journal entries.\u00a0 I do have to give the author credit for thinking outside the box and attempting to tell the story in this way.<br /><br />Audiobook was provided for review by the author.<br /><br />Please find this complete review and many others at my review blog.<br /><br />[If this review helped, please press YES.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Quick, Easy Read", "text": "The third installment of the Women\u2019s Murder Club, by James Patterson and Andrew Gross, begins when Lindsay and Martha (her dog) are jogging and run into Jill Bernhardt, a good friend and part of the Women\u2019s Murder Club.  Jill has some bruises and Lindsay asks her about them, but is brushed off with an explanation that she was caught in the shower door.  Lindsay doesn\u2019t buy it, but after Jill has gone, Lindsay sees a beautiful, expensive townhouse explode.  The townhouse was owned by Morton Lightower, a businessman who supposedly cheated his investors out of millions of dollars.  Lindsay rescues a young boy from the home, but the parents are dead, and a group that calls themselves August Spies takes responsibility for the murders.  The au pair is missing, and also the family\u2019s baby, so Lindsay not only is investigating a murder, but also a kidnapping.  A few days later, a businessman who is responsible for cutting the insurance coverage of thousands of poor people, is murdered by ricin; again August Spies.  Cindy Thomas, another member of the Women\u2019s murder club, receives an email from August Spies, and she becomes involved in the investigation with Lindsay.  As more murders occur, there is panic in the city, and there is pressure to solve the crimes and find August Spies.<br /><br />During the course of the novel, there are issues with Jill, her husband, and the bruises; Lindsay meets Joe Molinari, a big wig in the FBI who lives in Washington.  Not only is there chemistry, but Joe becomes Lindsay\u2019s love interest in this and subsequent novels.  These sub-plots add interest to the novel, but there is suspense during Lindsay\u2019s investigation, since she and others are in danger, and as the investigation continues and she becomes closer to finding the real murderer.  The investigation becomes personal as a member of the murder club becomes a victim.  The other members are devastated and work together to find clues as more murders are occurring in the form of bombings and poisonings.<br /><br />The Women\u2019s Murder Club series is a little lighter than James Patterson\u2019s mainstream novels; they are simply written, easy to follow, and very quick.  Although there are murders, the descriptions of them are not as graphic or violent as in the novels written strictly by James Patterson.  The Women\u2019s Murder Club series is more about fun, mindless reading than about weaving characters through researched details and real or historical scenarios.  Readers who are fans of Lindsay, Jill, Cindy, and Claire will enjoy this third installment; it\u2019s fun to follow their personal lives, and they almost seem like real acquaintances.  Besides the suspense, there is a little romance, a little drama, and a little humor.<br /><br />This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.", "images": [], "asin": "0446696641", "parent_asin": "0446696641", "user_id": "AF2LZKZEDQKGQMIFLQQAOIVL5BHQ", "timestamp": 1393218813000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "people or substance", "text": "First, this is a \"people\" book more concerned with the personalities that created DARPA than what has come through the doors of DARPA that has contributed to the technological advancements for both the department of defense and the public-at-large. He seems concerned that the reader not only understand the individuals but how clever he has been in being able to gain access to those personalities who know what is happening behind the walls.<br /><br />Second, it is clear that Belfiore gained considerable knowledge about rockets from his previous book. He is more comfortable in writing about this area of DARPA rather than about the game-changing world of computers and artificial intelligence or the larger DARPA agenda. He frankly admits his lack of understanding and seems willing to let that lack of knowledge ride in exchange for defaulting to the personalities working in these arenas.<br /><br />He points out that much of his information comes from DARPA contractors who aren't veiled in the same \"secrecy\" or opaqueness of DARPA itself. Yet he has not taken the time to explore the breadth of this contracted research but limits himself more to the historic, the visible and his personal zone of comfort.<br /><br />What Belfiore hits by accident and dismisses in order to retain his narrow focus is that while DARPA is \"edgy\" it is only the tip of a very large iceberg of military research by each of the various branches, some of which are of a similar nature to what DARPA is doing. One would think, from this book, that DARPA represents where the defense industry's research and development's edge is today.<br />It's not sufficiently technologically detailed, and does not significantly clarify what is currently going on behind the closed doors. It is more a personal tale of travel through the corridors of history and personalities than the essence of what makes DARPA a force on the frontiers of research today and for the future.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Movie Script in a Book", "text": "Storyline:  The story is about a boy, Mike, who runs away because he doesn't like the rules in the house.  He and his dog, Barney (who I pictured to be much smaller in the book than is shown in the trailer), get trapped on a railroad car traveling southeast.  When the train stops, they discover that they have been on a circus train and have traveled quite a distance from home.  Big Bob is a circus clown who takes Mike and Barney in.  And the story goes from there...<br /><br />Strengths:  The book moves at a good pace and flows well for the most part.  Readers are put in the driver's seat to imagine what everything looks like.  The book is a very fast read with simple language and sentence structure.  My husband felt it was a very competent book.  I asked his opinion since I happen to be a woman and not a man.  He felt it would be a very easy read for a child who is used to watching television and video games rather than reading books.<br /><br />Weaknesses:  This book is written at a 2nd or 3rd grade reading level, in my opinion.  It has as much description as Dori Hillestad Butler's The Buddy Files series.  Whereas, I felt the description was appropriate in The Buddy Files series, that is a weakness to me in this book because I would want even reluctant readers to learn to comprehend writing that is more detailed and specific.  This book (as you can see by the trailer) is really set in the 1950s or 1960s rather than today.  That isn't specified in the book.  There were also several points in the story that were very stilted to me.  For example, I wasn't sure how he got home in the first chapter of the book.<br /><br />Best Audience for this Book:  This book would be great for a child that is used to watching television and isn't used to a lot of descriptive language in a book.  It is written like a movie script without illustrations.<br /><br />My conclusions...<br />Is this a book you could hand your child and not worry about?  Yes. So, if you are of the mind that you just want your child to read and just want to make sure there isn't anything in the content to be concerned about, then this book would be fine.<br /><br />Is this a book I would recommend across the board?  Well...what we read becomes our model for how and what we write.  We want to read good examples of writing with description and good sentence structure because it helps us become better writers.  Reading helps our children learn how to write, how to spell, and even how to speak.  In education theory, there is an idea explained by Vygotsky about scaffolding.  We want children to read a step or two above where they're at.  We don't want them to get frustrated, but we do want them to be challenged.  This book is written at a 3rd grade reading level for readers 8-13 years old.  I think it would be appropriate reading for a 3rd, 4th, or 5th grade boy who is a reluctant reader.  If a boy is in middle school, they will need more examples of description so that their own writing can improve and they can grow in their ability to complete their school assignments.  This book is what I think a middle school boy might write.  That is fine.  But, by Vygotsky's theory, you want them to read a step or two above that.  The book I received in the mail today from the Christian Heroes: Then & Now series is a good example of that step above for a middle school reader.<br /><br />Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this book from Comfort Publishing for review.", "images": [], "asin": "0984559841", "parent_asin": "0984559841", "user_id": "AGAN3VWXL6UMM45GV4JJSEIDIXCA", "timestamp": 1302121669000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

For that, he had unlimited money, the best engineers, and the green light and obsession of his owner Henry Ford II, to win the race of ANY WAY.<br />And who was the enemy to be beaten? Ferrari A company that at the time had the expertise to make ingenious and coveted machines, whether for racing or for the public, but with an infinitely smaller budget than Ford. Ferrari had not been sold to Fiat yet.<br />Therefore, Ford's eventual victory was a certainty, all that remained was to define the year. There was no miraculous enada. And to make matters worse, when they finally won in 1966, it was unsympathetic and a little shameful, taking the almost certain victory of duo Ken Miles / Denny Hulme. MIles accepted the order, an employee who was grateful for the opportunities he received in life from Ford, but was embittered. He died two months later testing a Ford.<br />In short: GO LIKE HELL doesn't sweat that what Ford did was gigantic.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The Good, Bad, & Ugly", "text": "These books are addictive, or I would not still be reading them, but IMO, the series has a number frustrating faults. On one hand, Mr. Martin can write chapters that are downright brilliant and are as good as any fantasy I have read. Most of the characters are well drawn with a sly sense of humor that can make me laugh out loud. Mr. Martin has a fertile, original imagination.<br /><br />On the other hand....<br /><br />After almost three thousand pages of reading, I am convinced that these books are intentionally padded with fluff that even Mr. Martin's considerable ability cannot sustain. Some scenes are bloated like a wordy first draft that was never edited.  The ability to write economically and move the plot along without unnecessary detail is not one of the author's strengths.  Characters have circular arguments that go on and on, even though the outcome is obvious. This kind of thing happens so often that it's got to be an end in itself.  These books are designed to be loonnnngggg, to bulge on bookstore shelves. I thought  \"Storm of Swords\" was better in this respect than the previous two volumes, but there were still segments I found just plain boring and needlessly over written at the expense of other plot lines.<br /><br />The way that most characters lose out most of the time in this series is a bit depressing and makes me wonder if the author was dealing with some personal demons. It's like a detective novel where the hero inevitably gets beaten up at the beginning, so pay back is sweeter in the end.  Well, there's been thousands of pages of \"beaten up,\" with very little \"payback.\" Also, there's been little romantic love or sex in this series, while there's been quite a bit more sex that's been either forced or paid for.  Why?<br /><br />Much has been made by some reviewers of the author's \"inventive\" killing off of main figures or radically changing their characters, or changing plot direction in this volume.  I just found this capricious and undisciplined. It's like Martin grew tired of some of his characters or didn't quite know what to do with them, or just had too many to deal with, so he bumped some of them off.  While this was done within a plot context, it had the air of simple authorial execution rather than really being plot driven.<br /><br />From the get go, I believe Mr. Martin has spent his writing day focusing on whatever he felt like. He introduces characters or locations that are quickly dropped for no apparent reason, yet he spends an inordinate amount of time on trivial behavior of other characters.  I really think he is making this stuff up almost as he is typing it. If he has any kind of overall vision for the arc of the plot, it appears to change all the time. This mutability is not the imitation of reality, it's authorial self-indulgence. (I am tempted to call it laziness, but the guy has cranked out several thousand pages.)<br /><br />Mr. Martin is particularly effective at manipulating the reader by generating suspense through parallel plotting and cliff hangers. This suspense is often cheap or artificial.  For example, a character appears to die at the end of a chapter. It turns out later that they did not.  Anyone who was in the room when they \"died\" would know they didn't die, but the author has miss-represented the facts to the reader to create suspense. Yes, that's an authorial tool, but I'd call it cheesy pulp writing and not very inventive. Mr. Martin uses such crutches to keep the reader interested. If his pacing was brisker, with tighter scenes and focused plotting that has internal logic, he wouldn't need such tricks.<br /><br />Mr. Martin is very diligent at setting lots of such manipulative suspense hooks to keep the reader reading and buying more books.  It's a needed spur for the reader to get through the boring bits.  \"Well this chapter is really dull, but I must push on to find out what happens to Tyrion in the next one.\" \"That last volume really dragged at times, but I've got to see if Dany gets to Westros with the dragon's in the next one.\"  When a reader has invested thousands of pages in a storyline, it's hard to just put it down, even if it is sometimes dull, especially if the author keeps hatching more intriguing plots than he ever resolves.<br /><br />I have read that there is a rumor that this series will end at six volumes.  Given the pace of plot development, I'm not sure Martin can or wants to end it at only six.  A better series title might be, \"George R R Martin's Perpetual IRA Machine.\"", "images": [], "asin": "0553106635", "parent_asin": "0553106635", "user_id": "AFMEVKYQSE7PPEKPK4Y2JKFE6IMQ", "timestamp": 1150396681000, "helpful_vote": 26, "verified_purchase": false}

And it was easy reading; good writing with only a few unusual words for a Western.  Probably close to Bill Johnstone's writing style.<br />But I like my Westerns to have decent endings, this one ended badly.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Full of Mystery and Fright", "text": "Twelve-year-old Victoria Wright believes in perfection. Being top of her class isn\u2019t just an achievement, it\u2019s her right. Her best friend Lawrence Prewitt is nothing like her. Easily distracted by his piano and unable to remember to tuck in his shirt, Lawrence would be a lost cause without her. Then one day without warning Lawrence disappears. Victoria is baffled, especially when the people of Belleville don\u2019t seem as concerned by his disappearance as she is. When Victoria\u2019s investigation leads her to the mysterious Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls, she\u2019ll discover just what goes on behind its closed doors and that being perfect comes at a price.<br /><br />Claire Legrand\u2019s The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls is full of mystery and fright. Told from the view point of the ambitious Victoria, Legrand\u2019s book is a lesson in individuality, that being different is more valuable than being perfect. Belleville is a pristine town, where following the rules is imperative, and anyone who deviates from the norm is labeled strange. But Victoria discovers stranger things still when she begins to notices several children missing and something off about the perfect smiles of the adults around her. Victoria receives several perplexing warnings to be careful, but instead of being the perfect example of good behavior, something she\u2019s extremely good at, Victoria is determined to find her friend even if it means breaking the rules.<br /><br />Victoria is at first awe-struck by Mrs. Cavendish, who runs the Home for Boys and Girls. She is lovely, kind, and for some reason thoughts get a little fuzzy in Victoria\u2019s head when she\u2019s around her. Mrs. Cavendish is also a perfectionist and though it terrifies Victoria to think so, for there is something evil hiding behind that pretty smile, she is a lot like her. One thing I missed from this book was the presence of adults, aside from the villains. Victoria\u2019s parents have little to do than to present perfect personas that convince me they are the reason for Victoria\u2019s unrealistic expectations of herself and others. And when the mystery of the missing children is finally resolved, little seems to have changed for the adults in the story.<br /><br />I also couldn\u2019t quite grasp why Lawrence\u2019s musical gift would be looked down upon, but perhaps this is my own biases speaking. I would have liked the book to have set up his and Victoria\u2019s friendship more before his disappearance. We are told that part of Victoria\u2019s disapproval of Lawrence lies not only in her desire for everyone to care about school and rules like she does, but also because she is a little jealous. I would have liked to have seen this rather than being told. The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls is a fun quick read that has a lot of elements similar to Neil Gaiman\u2019s Coraline, but lacked enough distinction to really pull me in entirely.", "images": [], "asin": "1442442921", "parent_asin": "1442442921", "user_id": "AERQG2U5GKGCRVI2VVHK5DQZO3ZQ", "timestamp": 1427813982000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Interesting Ideas but wasnt for me", "text": "Julia Crane tackles the interesting idea of \u201cCyborgs\u201d in her newest book \u201cFreak of Nature\u201d. The main character is a cross between a feminine version of Data form Star Trek and Robocop. She is strong and much to the chagrin of her creators she has a mind of her own.<br /><br />Having donated her body to science she never expected what the out come could be. Free will and the right to choose what happens to your body are all questioned in this sci-fi saga.<br /><br />While quick moving, this story delves into a romance which seems illogical and unrealistic. In one breath a character can\u2019t feel something as simple as wind or get cold but then she\u2019s excited and feels pleasure at the touch of another\u2019s skin against hers. To be fair the moral implications are truly well thought out but end up unconvincing due to the hit and run style of the author.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Trek Isn't Supposed to be Depressing!", "text": "But this is! The book has 3 short stories set in the Star Trek universe, but from different perspectives of time. What would have happened if this person died or this person lived, or this person accepts a transfer to another ship or makes a scientific breakthrough, what have you. Well I don't want to give anything away, but the answer is pain, and unyielding horror and suffering apparently. The Trek as it played out on tv and the movies is apparently the only one worth living in as it is the only one with a potentially hopeful future.<br /><br />Both of the first two stories made me so sad I really didn't want to read the third. Nothing good happened. Usually with Trek even when they face terrible circumstances there is a sense of hopefullness, the possibility of coming through victorious. There was nothing of that here. Something bad happened and then something even worse happened after it and there was no end in sight. Kirk's doomed son, David Marcus is a main character in the first story \"The Chimes At Midnight\" and I can't think of another more tragic character with the possible exception of Othello or King Lear maybe. I haven't read a Shakesperian tragedy in 15 years, what does that tell you, that I should think of such a thing while reading this?<br /><br />It makes me sadder than I can say to give a Star Trek book only 2 stars. Really I'd give it 2 1/2 just cause its Trek but they don't do that here, more's the pity. Still the third story Brave New World was good. It had hope. It has nearly isurmountable odds that our intrepid heroes overcome with cunning and and intelligence and good old fashioned sticktoittiveness. Get the book for that story alone.<br /><br />I'll say this: if you like never ending drama, like the new BattleStar Galactica series, then you should be alright with the first two stories. I wasn't able to watch BSG after Season 1 but I know it still has a lot of raging fans so it must appeal to somebody. But if you like your scifi with relatively happy endings, I don't think that 2/3 of this book is for you.", "images": [], "asin": "1416571817", "parent_asin": "1416571817", "user_id": "AFBA7QHDLQD6ASAGXWPATBTJZSNQ", "timestamp": 1218594876000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Reads like a Bob Goff memoir. A great book idea with poor execution and little biblical support.", "text": "So many people rave about this book. I don\u2019t. But maybe you should still read it. The point of the book is to spur us on to love all people, all the time. While I personally had some issues with the book, if reading this will help you love others better, then don\u2019t let me stand in the way! And to his credit, Bob Goff is funny and a great storyteller, and I truly believe he loves the Lord and is doing a lot to help people and love on them. I cannot criticize him for lack of effort!<br /><br />So what was the problem? After each time I read part of this book, I came away thinking \u2018I need to be more like Bob Goff\u2019 or \u2018Man, I\u2019m never gonna be like Bob Goff.\u2019 And it\u2019s not about Bob Goff!! It\u2019s about being more like Jesus and loving like Jesus. It read more like a memoir of Bob Goff\u2019s life than a biblical book on looking like Jesus.<br /><br />We constantly hear the message \u2018Love others\u2019 or \u2018love your neighbor\u2019, etc. And I\u2019ve been struggling to figure out what EXACTLY that means. How do I, in my life, do this better? What does it mean to love? Can I still be loving someone if others don\u2019t feel like I am? Bob Goff did not answer these questions for me. A lot of the stories he tells, as other reviewers have observed as well, are not relatable to me in where I live and what I have access to. I can\u2019t send people to Disneyland. I can\u2019t fly back and forth to Uganda a bunch of times. I'm not going to let a homeless man hang out in my minivan during the day in between carting my children around. The practicality was not there. And maybe I\u2019m looking for answers that just aren\u2019t going to be cut and dry, and that\u2019s something I need to sit back and consider. But either way, this book does not take you by the hand and help you identify ways you can make a difference in your community. It overwhelms you with grandeur and paralyzes you into feelings of inadequacy.<br /><br />A lot of his stories seemed irresponsible. No Bob, don't go flying your little plane through this very risky place just for the heck of it- get those groceries back to your wife! The writing was a lot of disjointed stories peppered with a few lines of \u2018profound\u2019 analogy that most times didn\u2019t connect for me. I kept thinking, \u2018Wait, what point is he trying to make??'<br /><br />I also had issues with the way Bob did and did not talk about the Bible. I believe Bob has a high view of Scripture, and granted, a lot of the things he said, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t MEAN it that way, but perception is reality, and I wish he would have taken more care with his words. With every quote from the book below, I\u2019m sure he could explain further how it\u2019s not what I think, but here are my thoughts:<br /><br />\u201c[God is saying] \u2018You got this. You know enough.\u2019 \u201d<br />Um.. no\u2026? I think God would tell us \u2018I got this\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m enough.\u2019<br /><br />\u201c[Jesus] demonstrated the word with is much bigger and worthier and more accessible than any ten Bible verses.\u201d<br />I\u2019m thinking he maybe meant something like actions speak louder than words, but I don\u2019t think he has the authority to tell us what word is worthier than God\u2019s very Word.<br /><br />\u201cThere\u2019s a verse that says 'Do not despise these small beginnings'. I love that.\u201d<br />He gives no biblical reference and no context. It\u2019s an obscure verse in Zephaniah (I looked it up) and I\u2019m not entirely sure if he used it properly. And then says \u201cHe already believes in me, just as much as He knows the outcome. He already believes in you too. He\u2019s so confident we already know what to do next that He\u2019s willing to be silent even when we ask for His voice.\u201d I don\u2019t think we need God to believe in us. It\u2019s not about us. And He is not silent because he\u2019s confident in our ability to discern right and wrong. I don\u2019t think we can begin to explain why God is silent.<br /><br />[Talking about Ananias and Sapphira] \u201cSo why did they drop dead? I don\u2019t think anyone knows for sure\u2026They had probably said what they hoped to do so often they actually thought they had done it.\u201d<br />Um. Again, no, Bob. For one, he likes to talk about the Bible and say \u2018We don\u2019t know, but I think [insert either a bad idea or something that\u2019s already widely known]\u2019. For two, I\u2019m pretty sure they knew exactly what they were doing. They didn\u2019t want to give away all their money. And they didn\u2019t want to tell people that. It\u2019s that simple.<br /><br />\u201cHe continues to be with us\u2026He\u2019s sent us books about Him and has included a lot of letters, and He\u2019s sent us friends too.\u201d<br />And, also, Bob Goff, he sent HIS SPIRIT. Missed opportunity to talk about a pretty significant thing.<br /><br />\u201cWhen we draw a circle around the whole world like grace did and say everybody is in, God\u2019s love gives us bigger identities that we used to have.\u201d<br />And later he talked about the thief on the cross with Jesus, that Jesus didn\u2019t give him a quiz, he just said, \u2018You\u2019re in.\u2019 A little reminiscent of Rob Bell. God\u2019s grace is sufficient for all but not effective for all. Jesus didn\u2019t save both thieves, he just saved the one. Of course, we don\u2019t know who God chooses to save, but Bob Goff\u2019s words infer some Love Wins theology, which is not biblically accurate.<br /><br />He likes to tell us what God is thinking. Which, obviously, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our domain. But even the few places where God lets us know what he\u2019s doing, I think Bob still gets it wrong.<br /><br />The intent of this book is great and important and relevant. But not much of the content fell into any of those categories for me. His humor and good storytelling didn't make up for the lack of strong biblical support and frankly, his arrogance. Like: he says they are teaching witch doctors to read using the Bible....and his own book. What?! Why not just use the Bible? He appears to be equating his words with God's words. And then he casually drops that he got to meet the president at the White House with the man he brought back from Uganda. That part was not relevant to the story; I think he just wanted us to know he got to go to the White House. And then there's the parts where he passed all these hard law exams on his first try, he holds his office somewhere that would require people to pay $100 just to talk to him, their family's private lodge, etc.<br /><br />I can't deny that this book DOES remind you to see people, listen to their stories, involve them in your life. And that is worth noting and keeping with you.<br /><br />I want to love everybody, always, but this book wasn't doing it for me. There was way too much Bob to sift through to get those few sentences of value.

In my youth I read every one of the [[ASIN:0060751401 Judge Dee Mysteries]]  by Robert Van Guilin several times each. As with this book, they are full of sex and violence as well as historical information.  One thing each of the Judge Dee books had was a Dramatis Personae: a list of all the named characters, something this novel sorely needs, because there are dozens of characters who maddeningly pop in and out. Put the book down for a few days, and you are likely to forget who is who.<br /><br />For an historian, especially a British historian, it\u2019s disappointing how many anachronisms are contained within these pages. The story takes place in the the mid-sixteenth century (1584), but late in the narrative, the country doctor gives the hero laudanum, something which was unknown until the 1660s.  Likewise, Carr has people firing rifles. Firearms with a rifled bore (hence the name) were not made until the next century. Carr lists two weapons historians he consulted, yet he puts safety catches on matchlock pistols. (He\u2019s off by three-hundred years on that one.)<br /><br />There is a rich history of sixteenth-century Spain, but the novel is not worth it. Worst of all are all the descriptive passages which make reading this a rough slog. There are several road trips, each with detailed descriptions of the countryside and villages.

So, let's start with the characters. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan need no introduction. However, there is this character Rael Averross,who is supposed to be a Jedi, but dresses like a slob, smokes, drinks alot, sleeps around and doesn't seem to have anything to do with \" The Force \". Also, he made a bad decision, that obviously should not have been made, that got his Padawan killed. Ok so the Jedi Council sends him off to rule a planet until its princess , who is a child, is old enough to be crowned Queen. Really? This guy can't handle the job so he asks for back up namely Qui-Gon with Obi-Wan his Padawan, who are at odds for most of the story because they each think they have failed the other. Also, the Jedi Council has invited Qui-Gon to join the Council. Now Qui-Gon  believes in old Jedi prophecies, which the others including Obi-Wan don't, and he actually seems to be one with The Force, when needed. He has a record of being at odds with the Council at times and a bit of a free thinker which master Yoda certainly doesn't care for since he voted against the invite.  So, before Qui-Gon decides off they go to help Rael. They get there and the story drags on and on about the usual corporate greed, mining, using slaves, etc. Now there's a story line involving a couple of jewl thieves that should've been completely left out, imho, since it takes away from the main plot, which is infantile at best, again imho. There's a group of bad guys who are good guys that actually want to save the planet from the other bad guys etc. It's a mess but not one that makes sense in the end. Real is so useless as a Jedi he doesn't have a clue as to what's going on  even at the end when his precious child Queen, whom he adores, turns on him and loathes him more than any other creature in the galaxy.

Smart and resourceful, he\u2019s managed to keep himself alive for years with gadgets and gizmos until one day his radio signal picks up a human voice. He follows it, comes face to face with death, and wakes up with a cybernetic arm that grants him awesome powers. Will he use his newfound powers to save humanity? Or join the dark side?<br /><br />The concept and science behind this book are extremely interesting. The physics of how the technology works while affecting the landscape are explained in a way that made me believe this could all really happen and that I understand how time/space dimensions work. (I don\u2019t know anything about time/space dimensions.) I got Mad Max vibes mixed with Terminator - a duo I can appreciate.<br /><br />However, I will say, a lot fell flat for me. I think this book could have greatly benefited from line editing, cuts on repetitive expositions, and more in-depth dives into the world itself and how Wyatt came to function properly after being alone for so long without memories. There wasn\u2019t really a climax or any character development - everything happened exactly the way a good guy would want it to happen with evil doers turning good the moment of conflict which is not very believable.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Stupid is as stupid does", "text": "I write this for those who are not deterred by the negative reviews. I wasn't! wasn't expecting much, but at least hoped for some fun. Wikipedia is actually my idea of fun so I at least thought a thriller about fun things like codes and history and conspiracy theories such would be at least entertaining, even if the majority of the book consisted of People Talking About Things. Moreover, my standards for popular paperback thrillers are low (if people are complaining about the terrible writing, they clearly haven't read many bestseller thrillers. I mean, somebody want to defend the literary skills of Rollins or Grisham etc? Bahaha).<br /><br />Where do I begin with the Stupid? I will not bore you with a laundry list. Suffice it to say that the first time any character does anything remotely intelligent is in chapter *110* when a CIA agent notices wheelchair marks in the carpet (no worries, not a spolier and nothing any generic detective wouldn't figure out).<br /><br />I am a fan of far-fetched plots so long as they're logical within their world, so to speak. I'll suspend disbelief as long as the storytelling is good. I'll even excuse the bloated and formulaic plotting since I have a ffwd button I don't mind using as the same pointless details/dialog are repeated for the 110th time. But all of the above is so dumb I could only imagine that Brown was making stuff up as he went along. Plot twists actually rely on people doing stupid, illogical things. This is not fun.<br /><br />Critics have panned Brown for his latest book being nothing but a glorified travel guide, and even that doesn't bother me! So long as it's interesting and absorbing enough. I didn't mind the Dan Brown Wikipedia Lectures in the beginning...until the story began to fall so flat that my mind would start wandering as I imagined Dan Brown on his 3-day tour of DC grabbing museum brochures and recording docent lectures. Not that I don't like museum brochures. I just don't want to see Dan Brown copying them on his computer, I'd rather be able to imagine characters in those places, which my visions of Dan Brown on Tour kept blocking.<br /><br />Critics have panned Robert Langdon as being supercilious and obnoxious as he lectures everyone because he's smarter than everyone else. Lecture away, professor, so long as what you have to say is actually professor-like! Okay, true, there are lots of misinformed supercilious professors out there. However! The Internet! Libraries! People who know more about a subject than you the writer and can easily be interviewed! More than one book on a topic! Robert Langdon is, in this book, weirdly uninformed about certain religious texts he spouts off about. I've been annoyed by cheap research in other thrillers too, but Langdon should know better! So should his esoteric buddies.<br /><br />I'm telling all of y'all, I should've gotten some enjoyment out of this book. My standards were low, I'm a nerd who likes lectures, I have no fear of skipping pointless passages. But I wasted my time! I should've taken a clue from the Wikipedia article on this book that was probably buffed up by a publicist trying to rebut criticisms of the book...I wondered why even Hollywood dropped the story and politely moved on to Inferno instead. I imagine that, in spite of having paid Brown a ton of moola for it, they eventually had to realize it no amount of script doctoring could make it into more than a terribly boring movie.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're still not deterred, I strongly suggest instead of dropping your hard-earned money on this disappointing story that you borrow this from your local library (tons of *free!* electronic books/audiobooks if you knew not) and be ready to listen to it on 1.5x with your finger on the ffwd button.", "images": [], "asin": "0307950689", "parent_asin": "0307950689", "user_id": "AEZ74DSSJXQICPNTBMKZVFQDQFTQ", "timestamp": 1455869303000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Disjointed and short on detail but conveys the horror.", "text": "Caruso was a Lieutenant in the 9th Marines, 3rd Marine division, which he joined towards the end of its time on Guam. He was involved in only one combat incident there but his two weeks on Iwo saw him exposed to a lot more. Unfortunately these are generally presented in short vignettes, sometimes with minimal detail and a lack of context in terms of when it took place. There are a few occasions where he does go into more detail, like when he is under attack at night, with grenades landing in his foxhole but mostly he is too sparse with the details and it is clear he left a lot out. There are quite a few passages provided by fellow veterans and some of these are quite graphic. They serve, to an extent, in fleshing Caruso's story out a little more. Caruso also includes some potted histories for some of the men he knew who were killed. Altogether these certainly convey the horror of the battle but Caruso's own story is lost at times.<br /><br />Caruso was clearly the real deal as a soldier. The five officers above him were all first day casualties and he found himself commanding the company - from the front - almost from the start. He does provide some interesting information regarding some of his decisions but mostly he is writing about his interactions with his brother marines. Many of these become casualties and he provides statistics that emphasize the scale of these. By the time he is wounded less than 40 men are left in his company.<br /><br />This is a short book that can easily be read in a few hours. It is based on some articles Caruso did about the campaign, which were apparently very well received by fellow veterans. Perhaps because of this, it is closer to a memorial to his comrades than a typical personal memoir - it is just not complete enough for me for that. It doesn't conform to a traditional narrative structure and Caruso doesn't build his story. Accordingly, in my opinion, it fails to engage the reader. I'd have liked to give it 2 1/2 stars. It is still informative in a general way though and the tragedy of it all is very clear. But there are other memoirs (see my list) where it is all revealed in a more complete and compelling manner.

The physical similarities really stood out, and the abilities were cool to read about. I like that she explained some of their history and how their society works, where they live, how they've managed to stay hidden for so long, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The main character's mother was confusing to me. I suppose she'll be explained in further detail in the following books, especially considering what we learn at the end of the book, but as it is in this one, she seemed to flip back and forth and her reactions to some things were unusual (some readers may point out that that too could be attributed to her secret but considering how long she has lived the way she does, I don't buy it). And actually I felt that way about a few characters - they made dramatic shifts in mood and opinions, and some of their reasoning didn't really make sense.<br />*Predictable. Emma wasn't that much of a mystery to me. In fact I spent most of the book wondering why it took Galen and the other characters so long to figure out what she was and why. Heck it had to basically be pointed out to them.<br />*I get that grieving is different for everyone and some time has passed, but I thought that Emma's overall reaction to the loss of her best and seemingly only friend was a bit well, it flipped back and forth. At first it seemed very realistic but then Galen showed up and it was like she forgot except for very few later points in the book that were used to further the plot.<br />*Based on what I know about shark attacks, I would say that this one was VERY unrealistic.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The book tries to be more that it is", "text": "This novel by Richard Grant is set before WWII, in 1937/8, in Germany and Washington DC.  The author follows a set of unlikely characters involved in the shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage.  Canaris, Heydrich, plus a cast of made up characters, all play their individual parts in this story.<br /><br />We follow a semi-plot of Canaris reaching out to more neutral elements in the United States, and being thwarted time and time again.  We follow a US Senator, his \u201cfixer\u201d and his delicate son as they weave in and out of the fairly convoluted plot.<br /><br />This is one of those books, to my observation, that tries to be more that it is \u2013 pointing the way towards some elusive message.  So, I had a really hard time deciding if this was a three star book trying for four stars, or if it was a four star book, failing to bring in that fourth star and only getting three.  In the end, since I cannot give 3.5 stars, I will settle on three.<br /><br />The author speaks German, and wants to brag about that \u2013 so many phrases in German and without the following translation in English \u2013 pretentious, is my interpretation.  And put in places they were not needed to move the plot along \u2013 for example \u2013 the mention that the film playing was Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cSchneewittchen und die sieben Zwerge\u201d \u2013 which translates as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2013 but the author does not tell you that \u2013 I am.  As far as I was concerned \u2013 unneeded level of complexity or bragging.<br /><br />A pet peeve of mine is the term \u201cgone missing\u201d \u2013 this is a 21st century affectation \u2013 the term is \u201cmissing\u201d \u2013 as in \u201cthe man is missing\u201d not \u201cthe man has gone missing\u201d, or even worse \u201cthe man went missing.\u201d  The author uses \u201cgone missing\u201d in this novel set in 1938 \u2013 that phrase would not have been used.<br /><br />Another pet peeve of mine, people in trouble, take out enemies and then flee, and do not pick up the weapons of the fallen enemy so they have a weapon for future use \u2013 this happens when Oskar slashes the Gestapo man with the knife, and then leaves a perfectly good weapon (pistol) as they move off.  At least the author has Von Ewigholz think to take the weapon from the other dead Gestapo agent, when his Walther PPK runs dry.  Speaking of said PPK \u2013 Oskar carries it for several days, without ever checking to see exactly how many cartridges (note, cartridges not bullets) it contained after they had acquired it.  Another pet peeve \u2013 a cartridge is the entire package \u2013 shell casing, primer, powder, and bullet \u2013 a bullet is just the lead projectile \u2013 thus it is incorrect to say how many bullets are in a weapon \u2013 the correct usage is to say how many cartridges are in the weapon.<br /><br />The author has one of the SS characters in the book standing at his Berlin office on Prinz-Albrecht- Strasse in his office of the \u201cReich Security Main Office\u201d.  The correct term is &#34;Reich Main Security Office\u201d.  For an author that keeps banging us over the head with German phrases, to get this wrong is very jarring.<br /><br />One thing I will give the author is his correct attitude of the German people towards \u201cjaywalking\u201d.  They do not do it.  He has the comment made that the people jaywalking must be tourists.  Very true \u2013 on the street in Frankfurt 20-25 years ago we watched as tourist parents took their child across the road before the light had changed, and they were yelled at by the locals saying they were setting a bad example for their child and were being bad parents.  To be honest, I agreed!<br /><br />A very detailed book \u2013 and it does give a fairly accurate feeling of how it feels to live in a police state where one has to watch every word spoken and care must be taken to whom one will speak freely, even when there is supposedly no one listening.  After all, being paranoid is not crazy when there really are people out there trying to get you.  Just ask most any student on a University Campus today.<br /><br />An interesting book \u2013 it won\u2019t be for everyone \u2013 and as I said right between a 3 and 4 star rating.", "images": [], "asin": "0307270831", "parent_asin": "0307270831", "user_id": "AGFNWLAN7XVFFQEUOG32CPTCSKWQ", "timestamp": 1489334424000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Going out of her way to shield herself from human contact to suppress her abilities has branded her as a freak at her new high school--but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste...<br />Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition.  He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets.  Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she's thinking--and he's the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head.  She doesn't know who he really is--or what he is.  Damen equal parts light and darkness, and he belongs to an enchanted new world where no one ever dies.<br />* * *<br /><br />Evermore was simply another fish in the current of mainstream paranormal romance. Admittedly, the idea of Alchemy is not a great deal common, but there are the unavoidable stereotypes that hold true throughout all of today's YA Paranormal Fantasy.<br /><br />The unearthly beautiful boy who captivates the female protagonist with his unique looks and debonair charm that NO other man could ever equate to.<br />The main female character that is utterly defenseless when it comes to her love interest.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "I don't see this helping", "text": "This does not help students.<br /><br />There are fundamental flaws with the ICTS Basic Skills Test system period.<br />It is not a cheap test to take - it is not covered by grants or scholarships, it is pretty much<br />out of pocket.<br /><br />You can use this prep material, the prep material on the ICTS website, or any of the host of other<br />ICTS 300 test prep books available, but it won't help you.<br /><br />Why?  Because you will never know what you missed on the test.<br />That's right. ICTS only gives you your numeric score and a pass/fail graph results.<br />Each test section you took has a results page. They all lead to the exact same page, which is only the graph and number (like Reading - 199).  You will never be allowed to see your test answers, never allowed to know what areas in which you are weak.<br />This is a huge flaw. ICTS claims they can't give back test results because people would cheat. Sounds to me like the only ones cheating are the folks at ICTS. They cheat the students out of any real help this way.<br /><br />Let's say you scored 180 on the math out of a possible 300 (and the needed 240). Okay, you missed the goal by at least 60 points.<br />So, where is your weakness?  Instead of results that even go so far as to say you got 80% of the algebra questions right, 40% of the geometry questions right and 75% of the basic math right, you get a blanket number with no breakdown. You won't know if you are weak in geometry or some other area. You might have had a perfect score on all the geometry, but messed up the algebra questions, and need to review algebra. You'll never know.<br /><br />As it is, this is a nice financial racket for ICTS, but only milks the students. The Basic Skills 300 is very expensive to take.<br />The majority of students now fail this test after the Sep 2010 changes. I don't think a whole set of students suddenly got dumber, but that is what this test would lead someone to think. It keeps a lot of very good students out of their desired major, because without a score of at least 240 on each of the sections of this test, you cannot get into the education programs. Wanted to be a teacher since you were in elementary yourself? Can't think of anything else you've ever wanted to do? well, time to rethink your life, because Illinois has decided for you that if you can't pass their test with random hidden scoring, you can't possibly teach.<br /><br />What this test DOES do is show who can test well, or who is fresh out of high school.<br />Those people who love tests as a challenge or personal game to be won will love it. The white-knuckle testers, those<br />who break out into a sweat when they hear the word \"test\" will likely fail.<br />Those who are recent high school graduates will have all of this sort of data fresh on their minds, and probably do okay.<br />If you are older, it has been a while since you were in school and you want to go back for a teaching certificate<br />now that your kids are older, good luck with passing! You probably won't be able to get certified in Illinois. After all, there is a<br />shortage of teachers, IL certainly does not rank highly in national testing results, so instead of helping more students<br />get into good programs, they keep them at arm's length and lock them out. There are people with master's degrees who cannot<br />pass this test. Of course, they won't know why either, because of the ICTS policy of not sharing ANYTHING about your test results<br />with you except the grand total.<br /><br />Until ICTS can help students know WHAT they missed so they can study harder, it is a total shot in the dark, and both a waste<br />of money and time. The education programs in the state of Illinois are already very limited in scope and in the amount of space for students. They don't put education as a priority here, in my opinion. I didn't grow up here, thank goodness. But my spouse who did still is lacking in some very basic skills. Much like many states are doing, teachers teach to meet federal funding guidelines, rather than making sure all students have the skills they are trying to teach. They have a tight timeline and can't really spend the time with students like they should - the principal will be on their backs about meeting the school goals for federal funds.<br />So, ICTS helps to feed the un-education machine here by putting this test as a requirement, with nothing but practice tests to go on - there is NOTHING a student can do to help find out what they are missing on the tests. NOTHING. So, students continue to practice a broad variety of skills in hopes of passing it the next time they take it. Good luck - it's another random shot. You'll still not know what you missed or didn't miss - only the little black and white graph that will tell you if you tested good enough to apply to an education program.<br /><br />So, to sum up, if you don't pass the test the first time, you won't know why. You can, however, pay even more money out to ICTS for another chance to waste a morning several months later, long after you need to have passed. You can't get into the IL education programs to help you learn to be an effective teacher until you can prove you already know everything and don't need the program.<br />Yep - if you can do a great job on the test and already HAVE all the skills, then we'll let you into the education program, and you can spend the next two or three years taking classes that might or might not help you actually be a good teacher. But hey - it's only money and time. Those are both endless, right?  Right? (And I think we've all had teachers that were very smart themselves, probably  passed this test with a great score, but who can't manage to communicate the subject matter to the students, or who makes the students hate the subject after being in one of their classes! What a waste of human resources - this test rules out a lot of very good people who are not strong test takers.)<br /><br />This test proves NOTHING except showing who is good at taking tests.<br />It shows NOTHING about the potential to be a great teacher.<br />You can practice until you see test questions in your sleep, but you still will never know what you need to work on, because<br />ICTS keeps it all a secret.", "images": [], "asin": "0738608041", "parent_asin": "0738608041", "user_id": "AFTEMMCIMU62ONZHLLXEXSME4Z6Q", "timestamp": 1312697762000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "The early material is great, but Niven's latest is awful", "text": "In 1966 Larry Niven created the ultimate tourist with his short story \"Neutron Star.\" It was the tale of Beowulf Shaeffer, a laid-off pilot heavily in debt and easy to blackmail, and how the alien race the puppeteers convinced him to make a dangerous flyby of a neutron star. Throughout the late sixties followed several other Beowulf Shaeffer stories, which were previously to be found only in the out-of-print collection NEUTRON STAR. In 1994 Del Rey released CRASHLANDER, which brought back into print the Beowulf Shaeffer stories of the late 60's, together with \"The Borderland of Sol\" (1975), a new story \"Procrustes,\" and interim material that Niven had just penned to bind the stories together into one novel, as it were (there's no table of contents and the title of each story isn't listed at the head of the page). CRASHLANDER has some good material, but the latest writing shows that Niven's treatment of his Known Space universe has become very poor indeed.<br />The late-60's Beowulf Shaeffer stories were classics of science fiction, mixing hard science with colourful alien races and futuristic fashion. In \"Neutron Star\" the reader travels with Shaeffer as he visits what was then a revolutionary concept in astronomy. In \"At the Core\", the puppeteers convince Shaeffer to take an experimental hyperdrive all the way to the galactic core, where he makes a discovery that spurs the puppeteers into fleeing Known Space. \"Flatlander\" begins with Shaeffer as a tourist on Earth, and takes him on a journey with a millionaire to a very unusual planet. \"Grendel\", the last of the golden age of the Shaeffer stories, has Shaeffer foil a kidnapping on a newly-colonized world. These stories are all excellent and are recommended reading for any fan of science fiction.<br />The last two stories, however, are incredibly disappointing, nearly enough so to taint the eariler works. \"The Borderland of Sol\" was written after the decline of Niven's writing in the mid-1970's. It nearly repeats the theme of \"Grendel\" (with Shaeffer becoming something of a detective), but with unbelievable characters, B-movie shoot-outs, and uninspired futurisms. The last story, \"Procrustes\" dates from the 1990's and is nearly as bad as Niven's novel from the same time THE RINGWORLD THRONE. \"Procrustes\" has a plot that is convoluted to say the least, and none of the characters act like they have in previous stories. Most disturbing is the Robert Heinlein-esque turn into sexuality explicit scenes that Niven made in the early 90's, as \"Procrustes\" begins with an orgy. The frame stories were written at the same time as \"Procrustes\" are are just as bad. They contradict previous Niven stories (such as mentioning the Trinocs when they won't be met for another 200 years, the Puppeteer Fleet of Worlds, etc.) and end in an inexplicable murder that is nothing but a deus-ex-machina.<br />My recommendation: skip CRASHLANDER and find the out-of-print collection NEUTRON STAR, which brings together all the golden age Shaeffer stories as well as several other fascinating Known Space short stories.", "images": [], "asin": "0345381688", "parent_asin": "0345381688", "user_id": "AHBGHXADI7434HJ2LECPDAIDKDDA", "timestamp": 1018451794000, "helpful_vote": 74, "verified_purchase": false}

It is a nice idea, but it does not work for several reasons. First of all, most of us did not read these books in English classes we took in high school. In fact few books are read in their entirety in English classes; plays, poems and anthologies being preferred as they are shorter and thus provide a wider range of reading experiences. Secondly, some of Smokler\u2019s choices are obscure or lesser works and some are not even books.  Rather, the choices seem to be preferences that the author has now in his adult professional capacity.  Third, what you read in high school depends to a large degree on what school you attended and when. Also, it may be nitpicking, but why are these books \u201cpractical\u201d classics; how does this term differ from an ordinary classic? Finally, Smokler really does not provide much of a comparison between the experience of reading these works as a teenager and reading them as a mature adult.  Instead each passage includes information about the author and some critical and usually positive commentary about the book, the sort of information that is found in standard book reviews.  In sum, Practical Classics reads more like a series of book reviews than an effort to understand books from two different perspectives. Still, the book may well be worth reading. For one, the author lists works you may not have read and in some cases even heard of. Reading this works now, for the first time, may well be a worthwhile experience.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Disappointing book and code on audio signal processing", "text": "This book is simply hideous, and if the rating system would let me give it zero stars I would do just that. The text will not enlighten you if you do not understand audio signal processing, and if you already do understand it, nothing will be added to your knowledge. The only thing worthwhile about the book is the table of contents, since it does act as an outline of the subjects you should know, in order, if you intend to learn about digital audio signal processing. Following this table of contents as a guide, you should learn about psychoacoustics, digital signal processing in general, analysis & synthesis of sound, user interface methods, and finally effects specific to sound and compression methods if you wish to call yourself knowledgeable of audio signal processing. Unfortunately, you will learn none of that from this book. Instead, what you get is a sort of wandering novel consisting of the author's memoirs and musings on signal processing subjects. There are virtually no instructive diagrams, no equations, no pseudocode, just page after page of conversational text. Sure, I grant you that the author talks about subjects that I have not found in other texts, but that is part of the whole problem- he just chatters on incessantly about these subjects without being the least bit instructive. Some authors who write useless texts at least include source code on their CD's that partially make up for their lack of talent as writers/instructors. In this case you shall have no such luck. The code is one monolithic ball of lint so deeply entrenched in windows-specific MFC code that it is virtually impossible to unravel. There are no comments to speak of to enlighten you as to what is going on in any of the code. Instead the reader will find comments such as \"i suggest somebody to fix that\" and \"saves typing later\".<br />If you do want to learn about digital audio processing, you might want to take a tip from the table of contents and start with psychoacoustics and pick up the excellent \"Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics\" by Perry Cook, which is good enough for self-study. For DSP for the music-centric reader, try \"A Digital Signal Processing Primer : With Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music\" by Ken Steiglitz- it is very instructive, has plenty of equations and diagrams, and reads like a novel. Next, for analysis and synthesis of sound, find a copy of \"Musical Applications of Microprocessors\" by Hal Chamberlain. It was written in 1985, but it is an excellent introduction to sound analysis and synthesis in general and has a very good section on digital filters specific to audio. These three volumes should get you on your way to saying you understand digital audio processing. If you are a more advanced reader, read the two excellent volumes by Udo Zolzer- \"Digital Audio Signal Processing\" and \"DAFX\"- in that order.", "images": [], "asin": "0879305665", "parent_asin": "0879305665", "user_id": "AGLMH7GYYOVSH3IFQDXJZQLWZ3HQ", "timestamp": 1131207468000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Well Written and Interesting - but not Trustworthy", "text": "This book is frustrating. It is an interesting subject and it is both well written and well documented. So if you come a cross some factoid that you wonder about - there is enough material in the text (but not in footnotes) that you can trace the topic back to its source. But the tone of the text lends a certain skepticism. Mr. Mann is an advocate not just an observer. He takes the position that the Indians who occupied the Americas before Columbus were good and the Europeans who came across the oceans at the end of the fifteenth century were bad. He has a lot of scholarship but his has a persistent anti-white bias that make the whole book questionable.<br /><br />Let me give a simple easy to understand example. He writes (on page 136) that the worst calumny against the Aztecs is the charge of human sacrifice. Mann admits that the Aztecs (which he calls the Triple Alliance) did commit human sacrifice but equates it with the Spanish Auto-da-fe. there are several problems with this account. First Human Sacrifice was not and never has been main atrocity attributed to the Aztecs. The Aztec practice that he totally ignores is cannibalism. Secondly the Spanish auto-da-fe kills only a relatively small number of people whereas the Aztec body count in their ceremonies was much larger. And of course many authorities think the reason the Aztecs were constantly at war with their neighbors was for meat.<br /><br />Wikipedia states that all the victims of the Spanish Inquisition over the entire period of the Counter Reformation were probably only about 3,000 victims. Wikipedia also cites authorities including Victor Davis Hansen that the annual number of human sacrifices by the Aztecs alone was at least 20,000 and may have been as high as 84,000. And you must remember that the Maya and other groups were also holding their own slaughters. The Spanish Inquisition took place for a few years and then stopped. The Mesoamerican human sacrifices took place annually for centuries. Another difference is that the Auto-da-Fe was for adults only whereas the Aztec and the Maya seemed to prefer to sacrifice children. Go to the Yucatan and the tour guides will show the holes where the Maya threw teenagers every year to bring rains.<br /><br />Most modern readers find it hard to admire the Aztecs because they seem to have been a large scale cannibal culture.<br /><br />On page 141 Ma section labeled &#34; Assigning Blame&#34;. Not surprisingly Mann assigns the decimation of New World Indians to the Europeans who introduced Small Pox and other diseases. But this is a myopic judgement. Small Pox may have begun in China. We can't be sure but we do know that Small Pox decimated China and brought an end to the Han Dynasty. Shortly thereafter Small Pox got to Rome (the Antonine Plague) and brought about the decline of the Roman Empire. Small Pox stayed in Europe and Asia for another thousand years . Not surprisingly when Europeans got across the Atlantic they had no choice but to bring Small Pox with them.<br /><br />Five hundred years later white people found a cure for Small Pox and exterminated the virus. You would think that whites rather than being blamed, whites should be thanked for their medical science. The Indians in the New World were victims of Smallpox. It destroyed their civilization just as it had earlier destroyed the civilizations of Rome and China.

For better or worse.<br /><br />I'm not a professional chef, nor do I have aspirations of ever being one.  I don't know the names of all of the hot restaurants and 85% of the famous chef's names dropped within the first 5 pages.  Nor do I care to.  There's nothing wrong with people that do follow those things, but my interest in Lucky Peach and food writing stems from a desire to be awesome in finding inspiration to do interesting things in the kitchen, that my family has yet to experience.  And that causes a little bit of a disconnect for me with this issue.  Entering my 30's, I can totally relate to a lot of the experiences and questions raised when one is figuring out just what the endgame is in any career choice; those things are communicated through the lens of the culinary world in this issue, but they could easily apply to any trade, from porn producer to plumber (same thing?).<br /><br />Again, it's a great read, but I can see this issue not having as broad appeal as the first two.  If you liked the first two issues, buy this.  Continue supporting fresh writing and a neat quarterly. If this is the first time for you to read Lucky Peach and are more interested in something like recipes, you might want to get your hands on the earlier issues first.", "images": [], "asin": "1936365480", "parent_asin": "1936365480", "user_id": "AELSRPBXHGSK4JXQUMNY6GSJEYQQ", "timestamp": 1331278952000, "helpful_vote": 22, "verified_purchase": true}

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it a enemies to love, or a pretending to date situation, neither quite applies. But this is a book where two characters who would likely have never given each other a chance all of their own accord were brought together by a twist of fate.<br /><br />Jess is single mom. Her daughter seems like a little Angel most of the time, but life hasn\u2019t been easy for Jess. She had her daughter right as she was finishing college and the father was never in picture. Jess has almost always lived with, or near, her grandparents. They raised her when her own mother walked away. They\u2019ve helped her raise her own daughter. Jess has a good job and good friends. She might like to have someone to love but she says she\u2019s too tired to date. She doesn\u2019t have enough hours in the day.<br /><br />River is just an acquaintance that Jess and her best friend Fizzy run into every day at their favorite coffee shop. They kind of think he\u2019s a jerk. He\u2019s always rushing, he doesn\u2019t talk to anyone and he only tips in change.<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed this book a little bit more if Jess and Fizzy\u2019s dislike of River wasn\u2019t so immediate and seemingly unfair. Based on their interactions in the coffee shop alone, I can\u2019t see any reason why they disliked him. He was just quiet and seemed like an introvert.<br /><br />One day, they find out that River is involved in the creation of a dating app that will help people find their soul mates. Basically, it takes (what Jess would consider) \u201cthe hard work\u201d out of it. You send in a spit sample and you can find people that could be your perfect match. They\u2019re also truly looking for committed relationships.<br /><br />Fizzy talks Jess into submitting her info on her 30th birthday. She\u2019s right to say that it seems like the perfect scenario for Jess.<br /><br />But something interesting happens. Jess matches with River at 98%. There\u2019s never been such a high match. At least for the sake of the company, River and Jess need to give things a try. Jess is reluctant, so the company offers her $10,000 a month to go on a few innocent dates with River.<br /><br />Being practically forced to spend time together, they realize that they do actually feel very connected to each other despite how different they seem. As it turns out, they actually aren\u2019t all that different.<br /><br />But given everything that had led up to their dating, it can\u2019t go perfectly smoothly, can it? It definitely felt like the other shoe was about to drop. And I was curious to find out what the challenge would be to their happiness.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story and appreciated the unique storyline. I\u2019ve enjoyed all of the authors\u2019 books but Holidate and Love and Other Conversations have definitely been my favorites so far, so I wanted to make sure my rating reflects that.<br /><br />I got to read an early ebook edition from NetGalley.

Can we categorically conclude from such a finding that competing against chess-playing software has a causal relationship to making someone a smarter chess player sooner, as evidenced by the younger ages of recently minted grandmasters (compared to the ages of grandmasters from decades ago)?  It seems to me there could be alternative explanations for such a finding.<br /><br />Or take the findings that technology can help improve our memory (i.e., remember things more readily or for a longer time).  While the ability to remember things is important to our ability to reason about things, memory improvements do not equate to, nor necessarily lead to, improvements in reasoning ability.<br /><br />Some of the findings discussed in this book do show, however, that well-designed computer games, for example, can be used effectively to hone children's reasoning abilities, at least with respect to some domains, as evidenced by test score differences.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is worth considering.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Saint Louis is Still in Better Shape Than This Book Ever Was", "text": "So Jonathan Franzen is the new greatest American author, huh?  With accolades over his latest novel and the cover of Time magazine, I can only assume that he has improved substantially since writing THE 27TH CITY, his first novel.  And assume I will continue doing because, to put it mildly, this clunker did not exactly whet my appetite to dig further into his works.  It is almost difficult to pull the separate strands apart as to what makes this book really quite bad.<br /><br />The characters themselves are two-dimensional, none giving us a reason to care what happens to them, and none are drawn very realistically.  Bad enough that, but add in numerous minor characters with meaningless connections with everything else, and who add basically nothing to the book except the frustration of taking the reader on meandering tangents, and one cannot help but think that Franzen put them in just to make the book bigger and more ambitious than was warranted.<br /><br />Franzen, apparently under some belief that his characters are not the only ones who should meander, treats us to prose equally confused.  Really, I do not need or even want things just spoon fed to me.  But there were times, more than a few, in THE 27TH CITY, when I had to stop and simply figure out which of the (many useless) characters was actually the focus of some such passage.  This narrative is more winding than 1970s Latin American magical realism, even more unappetizing on American soil.<br /><br />And, really, the plot?  Truly, and I mean truly, ridiculous.  Those pesky Indians coming over to old Saint Lou and just blow the place to smithereens!  Helicopter attacks on private homes, bombs exploding in stadiums.  Yeah, and no one connects the dots.  No FBI figuring out, hey, this is the same type of work done by communist insurgents on the subcontinent, and a bunch of them just moved into town; Hey, maybe there is a connection!!  This level of suspension of disbelief is usually reserved for the works of Ray Bradbury but would be a stretch even for a typical John Irving book.  That Franzen was clearly trying to write an even more realistic novel makes this plot line all the more ludicrous.<br /><br />Sometimes I read an author (Ian McEwan comes to mind) and, based on one book, I want to read more.  For Jonathan Franzen, THE 27TH CITY had the exact opposite effect.  THE CORRECTIONS, FREEDOM?

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Solid, but ten years later, already feels stolid", "text": "\"The average electrician, air-conditioning mechanic, or burglar-alarm repairman lived a life that would have made the Sun King blink.\" (3) So opens this millennial survey of how wired, networked, and tangled American lives became circa 2000. Twenty years since Wolfe's last essay collection, this marks a more sober set of reflections on what now, ten years later, seems an optimistic start to what proved a dimmer decade.<br /><br />Wolfe argues, after the salacious \"hooking up\" of the sexy title takes but pp. 5-9 to elaborate, that science and academia, along with the media and consumers, connect in ways that allow affluence to rise and, unsurprisingly, intelligence to diminish for the norm. However, those in charge in Wolfe's world continue to wield power, and his fascination with the elite and how they clash with the proles makes this an engaging, if rather stolid, anthology.<br /><br />The first section, \"The Human Beast,\" examines the meeting of men with machines. Silicon Valley's birth comes with paralleling Josiah Grinnell, who took Horace Greeley's advice first-hand and went at least to the Middle West, of Iowa. His eponymous college schooled almost a century later Bob Noyce and classmates, who would spark the semiconductored, transistored post-WWII boom. This connects with an essay on E.O. Wilson's sociobiology, and while the pair move rapidly and neatly past everyone from Teilhard de Chardin to Nietzsche to Richard Dawkins, Wolfe manages to keep the material accessible. He sums up early Wilson: \"He was a skinny runt, and then for years after that he was a beanpole.\" (78)  Wolfe's prose style has calmed down, but he still keeps an eye out for telling details.<br /><br />On the other hand, other entries here feel already familiar. True, it's always fun to laugh at \"Rococo Marxists\" and the silliness of an art world that favors a pile of rust by Richard Serra over realistic figures crafted by Frederick Kirk. Of Kirk's rejection by the cognoscenti: \"Art worldlings regarded popularity as skill's live-in slut.\" (137) I agree with Wolfe in both critiques, but in his rush past \"The Great Relearning,\" the piece is too brief to do justice to the topic, and \"My Three Stooges\" in its lengthy explanation of his book tour for \"A Man in Full\" saps the essay before it gets around to the more valuable comparison and contrast of naturalistic fiction with film. \"Scene-by-scene construction\" and \"the liberal use of realistic dialogue\" share with film the novel's craft; \"interior point-of-view\" and \"the notation of status details,\" however, show the shortcomings of cinematic narrative. Wolfe defends his subject matter against the attacks of Mailer, Updike, and John Irving spiritedly, but when it comes to his own novella that follows, the interest for me lay more in the dialogue transcribing \"Florida Panhandle illiteracy\" and the way that two cameras can set up a sting operation and edit out dialogue than the actual plot of how a sleazy pair of operatives, one a manipulative schlub, one a blonde TV personality, pull off their set-up of three gay-bashing Army grunts who are suspected of killing a soldier at Fort Bragg, NC.<br /><br />Last comes the old Wolfe, a piece that he wrote about Wallace Shawn of the New Yorker despite the magazine's refusal to cooperate officially. Wolfe frames the article for \"New York\" magazine with a lively reminiscence of mid-60s journalism that recalls the sting operatives above. \"I'd heard of skeleton crews before, but this one was bones.\" (250) The original essay is fine, but for me any appeal lay in how the style that made Wolfe famous played off the more sober air of today's author.<br /><br />To sum up, after having read his previous journalism collections, this one finds Wolfe spanning his usual series of class studies, social critiques, and media send-ups. It's useful to capture the mood around the year 2000. But placed next to his groundbreaking New Journalism, it's a less combative, more unassuming stance.", "images": [], "asin": "0312420234", "parent_asin": "0312420234", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1264697447000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Not everyone thinks things are better and getting the uppers and the scrubs to work together is going to take a lot more than simply changing who's in charge.<br /><br />Trella didn't want to be a leader but she found herself thrust into the role when friends old and new, needed help against the rulers of Inside. Now that the rebellion is over she's ready to go back to keeping to the shadows, or the ducts while continuing her relationship with Riley. Instead, she is still looked to for advice and assistance. Part of Trella's reluctance to get more involved and take a role as a leader in the new society is her lack of confidence in her decisions and her fear that she might cause injury or death to someone she cares about. She still feels guilt for the arrest and death of her good friend Cog. Trella's reluctance is accurate since prior to the rebellion, she kept to herself, having few friends and fewer allies.<br /><br />It doesn't matter what Trella wants, she finds herself right in the middle of what looks to be sabotage and is caught up in finding who is behind the destruction. This is when things begin to pick up. Prior to that, it was more of a recap of what happened in the first book, which is helpful if a bit slow. As Trella hits the ducts again discovering conspiracies and threats to her world, she begins to question who she can trust. Here's where we see again Trella's lack of confidence in her judgement. She's only 17 1/2 years old and was trained to clean the ducts not deal with political intrigue. I can see how she would begin to question everyone's motives but she stops trusting her instincts and trusting her instincts is one thing that the Trella from the first book did.<br /><br />The relationship between Trella and Riley goes through some rough times. I was surprised that we didn't see more of them working together since they meshed so well in the first book. Their romance is definitely a sub-plot so don't expect there to be much from that front. Trella is pulled in so many directions from her conflicts with Jacy and his gang, to Doctor Lamont, who may or may not be Trella's mother, to Bubba Boom and his crush on her, to Anne-Jade and Logan. There are a lot of distinct relationships that Trella finds herself in. None really had much depth and I didn't feel like I got to know any of the characters very well except for Trella.<br /><br />The pacing through most of the book is fairly quick with little down time. Trella jumps from one crisis to the next with a few stops for imprisonment and torture. There are some questions left from the first book that are answered here but there are also more questions brought to light with the threats that Trella and the other Insiders must face down. I look forward to seeing what comes next in this YA sci-fi series.", "images": [], "asin": "0373210116", "parent_asin": "0373210116", "user_id": "AHCRWHCVPY77C66P3BHYHU2V34QQ", "timestamp": 1316027041000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Introduces traditions, displays imagery", "text": "This 1983 large-format book combines a Buddhist-infused commentary by Blanche Christine Olschak with photographs by Ursula Markus-Gansser and Augusto Gannser. The Swiss-based trio of scholars reports from the earlier stages of the kingdom's connections with the West, and the analysis is therefore very light on modernization, which had just begun in the period they visited. It can be perused in a sitting, as a quick introduction to the traditional mindset of the region.<br /><br />You do get a sense of the vast landscapes and mountain vistas. The photos of Lunana prove, as the text by Gansser underlines, the haunted quality of the far-off frontiers. Olschak's comments on the dances and rituals that dramatize Bon and Buddhist overlaps of stories and ideals also match the images effectively. What you won't get a sense of are the people themselves, in conversation or close-ups in the text. More from a distance, this shows the sights. It's brief, but fine for those who do not require an in-depth study of the realm.<br /><br />Chapters on the religious myths and culture (attending well to spiritual themes, as this book comes from Shambhala Press in English translation), the topography (lovely photos from remote areas and well as dzongs and folk artifacts), dance (good on symbolism), \"the coronation of the youngest king in the world\" in 1972, and a small overview of transitions into the wider world. By now it may feel dated. It may be consulted as more \"lightweight\" in heft and content by those wanting a less comprehensive, but academically based survey than the 1998 Shambhala Press edition of the 1997-98 Vienna museum exhibition with scholarship, \"Bhutan: Fortress of the Mountain Kingdom\" eds.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "rip off alert", "text": "1 star only because Amazon doesn't have 0 stars as an option...<br /><br />Nothing at all in this book resembles the marketing for it or the description for it (the blurb on the dust cover has nothing to do with the content of the book either). Events/characters from the first book - which I enjoyed - are barely mentioned in passing in this one. Anyone buying this, expecting the plot to actually continue - you know, like is kinda sorta *normal* in a sequel - you're out of luck. This looks to be another one of those sci-fi series about to split off into a half a dozen different storylines, with multiple authors *supposedly* co-authoring books with the writer who started the original (you know, like basically every title Baen books publishes, for instance); books which often only vaguely resemble the original work, if at all. Books that I suspect the original authors have little or anything to do with writing.<br /><br />But, the most damning thing about this book is that it's utterly boring. We get stuck with one of sci-fi writers' favorite tricks to fill pages...a \"data dump\" on the space navy hierarchy/procedures for a newbie on board Troy and another one on becoming a welder in space. Fills up the pages, for sure. And of zero interest to me.<br /><br />No thanks.

I was very disappointed with how the discovery of another dimension was handled.  It was so blas\u00e9.  They find a doorway to another dimension and instead of exploring it, they blow it up?  What is the point?  Nothing really became of the story.  There was lack of a sense of adventure you expect to find with stories that concentrate on exploration of the unknown.  There wasn't much action and the heroine spent most of her time thinking, researching books and databases, instead of exploring the final frontier.<br /><br />I did manage to read this entire book, however, I do admit to skipping through the long-winded parts [which were many].

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Of historical interest to conservationists. Recommended for library collections", "text": "I had very high hopes for Paul Errington's OF WILDERNESS AND WOLVES. After all, I was enthralled by Canadian Farley Mowat's classic, NEVER CRY WOLF, many years ago. But I found the Errington book rather disappointing, mainly because of its awkward, often wooden writing style. While Errington was much respected and widely recognized in his own time as a naturalist and conservationist, writing appears to have been somewhat problematic for him. We learn from editor Matthew Wynn Silvis's Introduction that Errington first wrote OF WILDERNESS AND WOLVES in the sixties, but he was never able to get it published. This University of Iowa Press edition is the first time these essays have been published in book form. Ironically, perhaps the main reason Errington could not get his book published was that it was submitted at about the same time that Mowat's NEVER CRY WOLF (1963) was published. Errington's publishers probably knew that Mowat's book, already enormously successful - and far more readable - would overshadow Errington's work.<br /><br />And I think they were right. Because far too much of Errington's text - certainly the first hundred-plus pages - are marred by stilted unnatural prose. Here are a couple of examples -<br /><br />&#34;Complexities in natural relationships have surely been a part of Life as long as Life has been on our planet, and surely Life has been acquiring complexity in relationships as it has been acquiring complexity in its forms.&#34;<br /><br /> - or -<br /><br />&#34;The public generally overrates the population effects of predation upon wild animals, at the same time generally underrating the effects of the less spectacular factors that may operate more fundamentally.&#34;<br /><br />I mean, try reading a few dozen pages of that kind of prose without yawning, I dare you. Especially when what you really wanted - were expecting - was an interesting story of wolves and life in the wilderness. Instead you get what reads like an awkward dissertation or scholarly study. And it IS a scholarly study. I get that. But in reaching for that distinction, Errington made the results of his prodigious research, along with his years of field work and personal observation, simply, well, dull.<br /><br />For me, the one redeeming section of the book, the one INTERESTING and most readable part, was &#34;Of Wolves and the Big Bog.&#34; In that chapter he falls into a much more personal, mostly first-person, mode, telling of a winter he spent as a young man (circa 1921) camping alone, hunting and trapping. He lived in a primitive shack on the northern shore of Upper Red Lake. The Big Bog was -<br /><br />&#34;... a vast swampy area. There on Minnesota road maps, occupying most of the north central part of the state and extending up to the Canadian border, lay one of the biggest blank spaces in the United States.&#34;<br /><br />Although he hoped to bag a wolf or two that winter, he only caught fleeting glimpses of them. There was plenty of other wildlife available though - lynx, fisher, weasel, muskrat, beaver, bobcat and more - and his traplines were pretty lucrative. He tells too of his loneliness and his friendship with a white-footed mouse that shared his cabin and &#34;cached prune pits in my footwear.&#34; Errington's solitary winter in the Big Bog country brought to mind another book I read years ago, Pete Fromm's marvelous memoir, INDIAN CREEK CHRONICLES: A WINTER ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS.<br /><br />One good chapter, however, does not a great book make. Much of the remainder of the book was something of a slog, seemingly cobbled together, with frequent citations from Aldo Leopold, his son, Starker Leopold, and other noted naturalists, a section about wolves in Scandinavia, and a brief mention of an ongoing study of wolves and moose on Isle Royale in Lake Superior. This latter reference served to remind me how very long ago Errington was writing this book, as numerous studies have since come out about the Isle Royale wolf packs.<br /><br />Iowa is to be commended for finally bringing Errington's work on wolves into print, because there is, I am sure, plenty of important wolf-and-wilderness data here, and scholars of those subjects will probably find much to ponder. I doubt, however, that the general public will find very much of interest here. Recommended primarily for library collections.

The first time I heard that was when reading (listening to the audiobook) CWG book 1. The first time ever hearing those words felt magical like \"it was meant to be, meant for me\".

I decided to get another in the CWG series to see if I experienced the same \"awe\" and purchased the Communion With God audiobook.<br /><br />I was disappointed with Communion with God, it contradicted some of the things explained in CWG book 1. In CWG book 1, one of the things that gave me comfort was that it stated that when we are lookimg to God for guidance or answers God tries to answer us with signs or by trying to speak to us through our feelings, or giving us ideas\\inspiration and if we ignore these even by a song like when we turn on the radio. It stated that God is always communicating with us. However in Communion with God, he states that:<br /><br />* There are no signs<br />* God gave us free will for us to do what we want to, therefore God is not going to direct us<br />* God would not be so cruel as to communicate with us by using signs, if God wanted to communicate with us God would just talk to us directly. Neale states in this book (through the voice of God) that God could present him\\herself to us if communication was necessary....<br /><br />Hmm totally different than what was said in CWG book 1.<br /><br />Communion with God it states you should not choose masters that tell you that the only way to connect with God is if you buy this or that book or if you follow this religion or that. That you only need to silence your mind and go within... Well as my trip to the library showed....

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "chalkboard analysis", "text": "This is a well-written, interesting book.  However, in my opinion, it tells only part of the story.  It looks at how Netscape formulated its strategy, but not at how (or whether) this strategy was executed.<br />This is like explaining a football game entirely on the basis of the diagrams  that the coaches drew on the chalkboard.  What actually happened on the  field gets no attention.<br />For example, the authors claim that one of  Netscape's strategies was to leverage Internet standards.  However, the  reality is that with its browser Netscape thumbed its nose at Internet  standards, particularly when it dominated the market.  Even today, its  browser generally is seen as less compliant with standards than is  Microsoft Explorer.<br />Another alleged Netscape strategy was to &quot;eat  your own dogfood,&quot; which means using your own products.  The reality  is quite different.  For example, Netscape released a production version of  Enterprise 3.0 and kept its own web site on Enterprise 2.0 for several  months afterward.<br />In 1996, a key component of Netscape's web server was  something they called LiveWire, which provided scripting and database  connectivity.  I adopted it for my web site in the second half of 1996.  However, after several months of trying to get it to work reliably, we had  to abandon it, moving to Java servlets instead.<br />Meanwhile, as of late  1997 (when I stopped following it), Netscape's web site still had not  adoped LiveWire.  They let other users suffer with the bugs and problems in  LiveWire, while they ran their own site using the older technology of  CGI/Perl.  That means they spent at least 1-1/2 years in real time  (multiply by 7x to get Internet time) NOT eating their own dogfood. In  contrast, Microsoft used their competing Active Server Page technology  immediately on their sites.<br />To return to the football analogy, my epitaph  for Netscape is that it is a company that told the press and its  shareholders that it was aiming to play in the Super Bowl, but disdained to  practice blocking and tackling.<br />While Netscape's executives were  formulating these nifty strategies, Sun and Microsoft were getting their  code in shape.  In my opinion, that is most of the story.", "images": [], "asin": "0684853191", "parent_asin": "0684853191", "user_id": "AGUMF3UA5RTUCD3N5G3Y7PERBBXQ", "timestamp": 947428094000, "helpful_vote": 23, "verified_purchase": false}

Most recipes are old classics that have been perfected over the years then adjusted as our tastes and diets change. I'm not sure why the classics were redone other than to simplify or dumb down the recipes. The changes don't make the recipes healthier or taste better.<br /><br />The opening starts with a guide to very common herbs with a taste description: Mint; menthol icy. Parsley; bitter. Clearly a reference for new eaters.<br /><br />Then there's a guide to seasoning blends using dried spices and herbs, even dried parsley. A heavy dose of dried herbs are used throughout the book even when fresh would taste better.  I love using spices, but herbs can so easily be found fresh or grown on a window sill I just don't understand the liberal use of dried herbs, particularly those that change considerably in flavor and nutritional value once dried. Garlic powder, garlic salt, and onion powder is used abundantly.  It must be a regional taste preference.<br /><br />The Friendsgiving casserole is a simplified chicken pot pie but so rich with all the heavy cream, cube of butter and tub of sour cream.<br /><br />The Chicken Parm is covered in Ritz and mayo. It isn't deep fried, just a skillet fry to crisp it but then mayo/parm is smeared on and sogs it.<br /><br />I didn't buy the first book.

That's just one of the reasons I was so disappointed in this one, LONG, TALL, CHRISTMAS.  I was bored, and did not look forward to reading it each night. The characters were dull, uninteresting, and seemed all around shallow to me. I didn't care enough about any of them to keep turning the pages, and the storyline was the same way. Will the UPS man be back with the package of presents? Will they find a real tree? Will Amy stop pouting and crying--not that she didn't have reasons. Will Kylie punish her kids again for being human? Will Kylie grow up? Will Shane decide what he wants in life? Will Hunter meet any new friends? Will Henry and Muriel see the light, albeit after years and years of waste?  Will everyone like what they're eating? Will they be able to get along? Auuuggghhhhh!  It was all such an uncomfortable read. Nothing really going on for an in depth storyline, just the most unpleasant of day to day routine. I have read so many really good Christmas novels, mostly romance,  that this was outstanding for how bad it was. The answers to the questions were as uninteresting as the questions themselves.  This whole book felt rushed and slapped together at the last minute. I agree with the reviewers who don't think Janet Dailey wrote this. It feels like a ghost writer took a sketch of characters and a loose outline,  and then threw it together without any thought or feeling for what he/she was doing or putting out. Probably just for the money.(So bad even the model on the cover is hiding his face, so he won't be identified with any of it. haha) Anyway, I am sorry I didn't like it, but Janet Dailey was a great writer.

The hero and heroine were high school sweethearts until he decided to break up with her before she could break up with him, now years later his pro football career was ended early due to an injury and her life is tabloid fodder when she is dumped by her A-lister Hollywood boyfriend for someone else. They both return home at the same time and end up in a competition over the building her grandmother\u2019s pet boarding business is in.<br /><br />I had a hard time connecting with both of these characters, they were perfectly fine but I honestly felt like we never really got to know them.  Tony (Cam) Cammareri came home to get away from the media and try and figure out his next step which he believes is opening a sports bar type establishment in his home town.  Hadley Wells has worked saving the reputations of some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars but the uproar over her relationship going south sends her packing back to Seashell Harbor where she plans to rest and help her grandmother with her pet boarding business. Both characters just felt a bit flat; Hadley had big dreams as a teenager to save the world, help animals but ended up in a very different career yet she never talked about that change. Cam wanted out of town and knew football was his answer but he has a wonderful family so why was he so anxious to leave?  I guess I just felt disconnected from these characters. The other issue was I didn\u2019t feel the heat between them at all, I felt their friendship even at the start when they were in \u201ccompetition\u201d for Hadley\u2019s grandmother\u2019s building, but no sizzle and this has nothing to do with the behind closed door sex scenes, I read a lot of books like that and sometimes the heat between the characters is so hot that the imagination of what goes on behind those doors is smokin\u2019!<br /><br />The town, it\u2019s residents, Tony\u2019s family, Hadley\u2019s friends were all interesting and I felt the series was set up well.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The Old Fox Deceiv'd by Martha Grimes: A review", "text": "Twelfth Night in the tiny Yorkshire fishing village of Rackmoor. It is a typically chilly and very foggy night with a North Sea wind blowing. The perfect night for murder.<br /><br />A young woman in costume apparently on her way to a Twelfth Night party at the local manor house is brutally murdered, her body left on steps on the way to the party. She was stabbed with some sort of two-pronged instrument. The police can't find the murder weapon or very many clues to what actually happened.<br /><br />Days later, when the trail has already grown cold, New Scotland Yard is called in and Inspector Richard Jury, along with his sidekick Wiggins, is assigned to the case. He's soon joined by his unofficial sidekick, Melrose Plant, who just happens to be a guest in that aforementioned manor house.<br /><br />There are many questions about the victim of the murder. First of all, her identity. Was she really Dillys March, the long-lost much-loved ward of Colonel Titus Crael, owner of the manor house? She certainly bore a remarkable resemblance to Dillys, but that wasn't the name she gave. Was she truly Gemma Temple, the name which she had used? What was she doing in Rackmoor?  Was she involved in some kind of scam in which she was trying to convince the Colonel that she was his ward so that she could share in his fortune? And, most of all, who stood to gain by her death?<br /><br />As Jury and his cohorts begin to pursue these questions, they uncover an unexpectedly tangled web that leads to other undiscovered murders. And, of course, it all has its roots in a decades-old maze of unrequited loves and unavenged wrongs in the village. The quiet, unassuming English village once again proves to be a very dangerous place.<br /><br />As in Martha Grimes' first entry in her Inspector Richard Jury series, which I just read earlier this week, we find that Rackmoor has its full complement of eccentric residents, several of whom have potential motives for murder and all of whom seem to have strong opinions about the murdered woman, as well as some of the tragedies of earlier years which have possibly led up to this particular murder.<br /><br />Two of the most sympathetic characters whom we meet in The Old Fox Deceiv'd are a young boy named Bertie and his dog Arnold. Both ultimately play a role in the unmasking of the murderer. Twelve-year-old Bertie has been left on his own by his mother who has gone off to London to pursue her dreams, which would only be impeded by the presence of an almost teenage son. Bertie and Arnold actually manage quite well without her. Bertie works part time and various people look in on him daily and make sure he has what he needs. The village takes care of its own. Who needs social services?<br /><br />Rackmoor does indeed seem to have been an idyllic place before those pesky murders intruded. Things are never quite what they seem though, are they?<br /><br />Again, Grimes has constructed a charming cozy mystery with quirky characters and plenty of gentle humor. Just the ticket for a summer day when it is too hot to do much of anything except sit in the shade with a cooling drink and read.", "images": [], "asin": "B00BHHDMQE", "parent_asin": "B00BHHDMQE", "user_id": "AGK6QUAZGDZSY4O5SVAVBPONX7PQ", "timestamp": 1405881259000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Why did I waste my time? SPOILER", "text": "This was my first and last by Lisa Scottline. This book is a jumbled up mess. It started off good and kept my interest but went downhill. The first 3/4 of the book are the court case and what happened in the weeks before the court case. It was drawn out way too long and got boring. I almost stopped reading about halfway through but decided to trudge on thinking it might get better. It didn't.<br /><br />This book is not what I would call a thriller by any means. Well, I was thrilled when it was over but that's not the point.<br /><br />!!SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />The book is about a stepdad (Noah) and his court case of the murder of his step daughter. This goes every other chapter, along with the mother (Maggie) and her point of view.<br /><br />The story goes along very slowly until we find out the step daughter wasn't really the step daughter but an imposter. The real daughter was kidnapped and put in a sex traffic ring. WTH? All of this happens in the last few pages. There was no mention of anything suspicious (besides the murder) until the very end and it was all jammed in 30 pages or so. It was like she added the last chapters of a different book onto this one. It would have been more interesting if this storyline was presented much earlier on.<br /><br />There were also a few chapters about Noah and his experiences in jail. This added nothing at all to the story and could have been left out completely. I'm not sure where she was going with those chapters but she shouldn't have went there.<br /><br />Glad it's over, won't read another!", "images": [], "asin": "B073NZQ28Z", "parent_asin": "B073NZQ28Z", "user_id": "AGUNO6OIHXJ6UCB2CK2XLX33Z7EQ", "timestamp": 1595634806414, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Pretty to look at but leaves one wanting more!", "text": "Pro's: (1) Small and compact yet 2000 pages- very convenient! (2) Leather and looks nice!

(5) Opportunity to try something new if bored with LoTH?!<br /><br />Con's: (1) Uses the Grail Psalter - blahhhhhh! (2) Uses NRSV translation for scriptural texts! Blahhhhhh! Just say it....'man', not 'person'. Inclusive language will be the death of linguistic beauty former generations cherished. I am not happy with the ICEL's bland translation of the LoTH by CBP, but it is more the norm in the Church and provides greater variety of readings. It was said of ICEL \"Half know Latin, but know no English...the other half know English, but know no Latin!\" But I digress...(3) Does not provide all psalms of the psalter, only 100 or so! And many of those have been redacted and shortened. (4) The compiler/editor is a Lutheran! No offense, I want my Catholic stuff from faithful Catholics! He may play with the Benedictines up in Minnesota but that doesn't make him suited to compile and offer texts for Catholics to use. (5) Uses a one week psalter instead of two (or four if you prefer). (6)Done in conjunction with Benedictines in Collegville, MN. They are not a hotbed for strict liturgical orthodoxy. (7) If you are a more traditional leaning Catholic don't even bother.<br /><br />In the end I will stick with the 4-volume Liturgy of the Hours and Fr.

Pyne has some good ideas in here, but they are pretty much the ideas you would find in most writing manuals.

I see why he does not care for that approach; he cannot do it.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A highwayscribery \"Book Report\"", "text": "One of the nice aspects to being sick, and there is a silver lining in just about anything, is that you, if so inclined, can get a lot of reading done. We're talking mildly sick here; sick so that you drift in and out of swoons induced by stuff you can buy over the counter. the scribe's Nyquil years are mostly behind him and reveries during this recent lay-up were fueled by Alka-Seltzer flu medicine, benadryl, and Vitamin-C powder packets.<br /><br />the highway scribe scarfed down a good number of books and reports on them will be spread out over the next few weeks. First to be finished off was \"The Muckrakers,\" which was edited back in 1961 by Arthur and Lila Weinberg.<br /><br />The tome contains actual writings of the famed muckrakers who wrote in the first decade of the last century. Their specialty was uncovering abuses. Those abuses could be committed by labor unions, or government officials, or a church, but mostly they worked to bust up the concentration of wealth as represented in the giant corporate trusts that had surfaced 20 or 30 years before.<br /><br />President Theodore Roosevelt termed the expression, \"muckrakers\" in a speech that was largely critical of the era's journalists who were, otherwise, mostly on his side, or at least shared the same goals of reform and a cleaner running system.<br /><br />Among the offerings in \"The Muckrakers\" is the very speech in which Roosevelt coined the expression. He drew it from Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\" and \"the description of the Man with the Muckrake, the man who could look no way but downward, with a muckrake in his hands; who was offered a celestial crown, but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor.\"<br /><br />TR went on to preach caution to those leading the crusade and called for an even-handedness that would inform, but not inflame.<br /><br />As they say, the name stuck.<br /><br />The book spends some time on the atmosphere in which the muckrakers were born. It talks about the growth of mass circulation magazines such as \"McClures\" and \"Cosmopolitan\" that took it upon themselves to finance investigative reporters and publish their in-depth revelations to much scandle and positive affect.<br /><br />Each section (The City, The State, Pure Food, Child Labor, etc.) is framed with a perusal of the issue at the time, and of a profile on the writer who did the work. Among these names are Lincoln Steffens, Ida Tarbell, Ray Stannard Baker, Upton Sinclair, and Mark Sullivan.<br /><br />the scribe pulled the book for purposes related to his career as a journalist. It's good to know what pioneers like this did and why. But coming to this book is a little like sampling Elvis after being raised on Pink Floyd. You're not going to see the novelty in it; and from their novelty were the muckrakers' powers drawn.<br /><br />This kind of reporting is done today in any number of weeklies and monthly's on the right and left; \"Harpers,\" \"Atlantic Monthly,\" \"The New Republic,\" \"National Review,\" and so on. The techniques have hardly changed. This book is about how the groundwork was laid.<br /><br />What's better and more useful about this collection of magazine articles are the portraits they render of the country in that time. It is a raw powerhouse sprawling its industrial self across a giant and empty continent, mostly lawless, if very Christian.<br /><br />The essays connect the dots on how the great fortunes of the era - Frick, Vanderbilt, Morgan etc.- were built largely through the acquisition of what was supposedly the public trust. They tell the story of child labor to the tunes of millions across the southern textile belt. The muckrakers spun sturdy yarns of corrupt city machines and detailed even the battles for territory, or the love lives, of immigrant newsboys from the street.<br /><br />It is hard to tell whether such an era of excess and abuse of public trust is a reflection on our own times, or if times simply don't change; that for all our pomp and circumstance, being a thug pays best.<br /><br />There was a law back in those times, that prevented people from leaving government to lobby the same place he just worke.<br /><br />What happened to that?<br /><br />The work/slave conditions documented by William Hard and Edwin Marshall are not gone, just shipped overseas.<br /><br />You can be a television cameraman and be killed in Baghdad hotel by U.S. forces, or you can reveal the secrets of a seedy senate and be mysteriously assassinated like David Graham Phillips was for articles reproduced in \"The Muckrakers.\"<br /><br />Two pieces at the back of the book, \"De Kid Wot Works at Night,\" and \"The City of Chicago: A Study of the Great Immoralities,\" create a rather staggering portrait of the crazy town on the lake at the height of its power.<br /><br />This Chicago is teeming and active to the outskirts, a city created along mass industrial lines where the human element was something of an afterthought. The city's largest business is vice, providing cheap (as in money) girls and cheap beer to the great swathes of workerdom serving the meat industry, the railroad, the ironworks, shipping. The girls are innocents pruned from the immigrant class and their trafficking is handled out of a city police department.<br /><br />And for all that, the actions government took in response, the attention paid by the general population to the muckrackers' message, are far beyond anything we might to expect today in terms of reform. The ink-stained wretches do not tread upon the feet of corporate titans they way they did then. They will not impose the will of the state over industry. Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican when blacks voted Republican, did.<br /><br />And America listened to its muckrakers, rather than label them, and acted according to their recommendations. \"The Muckrakers\" as a book shows us what that interaction meant, and what has been lost between the press and its audience.", "images": [], "asin": "0252069862", "parent_asin": "0252069862", "user_id": "AFTIBR2KLZS32KMJ5SWEPD3JMD3A", "timestamp": 1238963059000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

It included three of my favorite things: classic movies, RPGs, and what specifically caught my eye about this title, explorations of how to enhance RPGs with storytelling principles.<br /><br />Instead, 88% of the content was spent analyzing a few hundred individual beats, one by one, over and over, across three fixed texts.

How do you apply beat analysis as a GM?<br /><br />The section that finally got around to that - the reason I bought the book - amounted to less than 1% of the book's content. There are a few general comments and suggestions, and that's it. The book doesn't drill down into methods or techniques for applying beat analysis to RPGs. There are no worked examples of planning or running scenarios for an RPG.<br /><br />How about applying the beat idea as a player? Well, no, it seems, because it would be \"a massive feat of passive-aggressiveness\" and \"appalling\" to look at a GM's story beats.
