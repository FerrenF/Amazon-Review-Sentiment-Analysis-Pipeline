{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not impressed with the characters", "text": "I know that Ed Brubaker has a strong reputation in the comics community, but I can't say that I was impressed with this. Kill or be killed establishes itself as a more grounded take on the vigilante genre of comics, but over four issues, I'm not really looking forward to more.<br /><br />The story starts on our main character killing a bunch of gang members, and him flashing back to how he got to this point. Dylan is a professional student with a lot (and I mean a lot) of mental health problems. After attempting to take his own life, he sees a demon (or does he!?) who tells him that unless he takes a life of someone who deserves it every month, he'll die instead. The story then follows his first sloppy kills to when I suppose he eventually gets good.<br /><br />I suppose my basic problem with the series is that it both wants to act as political commentary while also being bleak for the sake of being bleak. Dylan is prone to making standard political commentary about police violence, the drug trade, and social problems, which is fine as far as it goes. But he also wants to disregard the law and kill people to make the world better, which goes against pretty much everything the first thing is trying to be. This type of having the cake and eating it too results in some of the worst Punisher stories, and it doesn't work any better here. The fact that all the main characters are basically screw-ups didn't endear me to them either.<br /><br />I will say the artwork is good, but I'm not planning on going any further with this series.", "images": [], "asin": "1534300287", "parent_asin": "1534300287", "user_id": "AHHV4DVQ7GPHWOSROGQKKIP6C3KQ", "timestamp": 1652061782789, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

The story picks up at the end of the summer break as Conryu and Maria head to The North American Alliance\u2019s\u00a0Arcane\u00a0Academy\u00a0by a magically powered train. He is once again\u00a0harried\u00a0by the press and one reporter in particular.\u00a0Conryu\u00a0is a fish out of water at the academy. He does not want to be there any more than most of the student population that views him as an abomination wants him to be there. This could not be made more clear that his initial reception of being bombarded with tomatoes upon arrival by three upper-class wizards.<br /><br />The first book in the series was devoted to world building and giving broad strokes to a wide canvas to give the reader and listener a feel for what kind of scope there was to this magical world. This time out the author has pulled back to focus on the hero\u2019s journey. We get to see the highs and low\u2019s Conryu endures during his first semester at the Academy. He is ostracized, attacked, and even Maria has little time for him. What is the only male wizard to do?<br /><br />Conryu\u00a0strives to make the best of it while trying to slowly understand his magical abilities and learn to live in a world foreign to him. He slowly makes friends and joins a Wizards club. As the semester goes on life moves on for both Conryu and Maria. When she is No longer the center of Conryu\u2019s universe leads it leads to Maria\u2019s consternation.<br /><br />Attention Holding<br /><br />The story is excellent at holding my attention and was over much too soon. There are bound to be some comparisons to Harry Potter due to the Magic Train and a\u00a0Magic\u00a0Academy. But that\u2019s about where it will end. These books are for older audiences and Harry Potter never signed a contract with a Demon. The world is unique and thought-provoking and holds the listener's interest due to the great story and the great narration.<br /><br />Narration/Production Quality<br /><br />The narration is by Joe Hempel. Mr. Hempel again provides an outstanding vocal performance in this second audiobook in this series. He delivers not only compelling narration but also provides a wide range of vocal character\u2019s interpretations. Each character was recognizable with unique voices done in a natural manner. The production quality by Tantor was top of the line as always they never fail to produce a high-quality audio product.

This story is about feelings, and how emotions can both heal and destroy. So they meet, look cute together, play cryptic games...Happily ever after, nice and easy, you think?  Well, hell, no, with the emphasis on hell.  A flowing, graceful writing style draws you in...but then ties you in knots.  What's hard to comprehend --  the understated horror depicted so rationally  right before your eyes. Life's no party for either Josh or Heather, yet, in the end, they are part and parcel of each other, and damn, you feel for them.  You want them to take it and run with it, off into the sunset.  Surely, they deserve happiness. The ironic twist, turning the tables on the vicious treachery that linked them, winds up being their link to love, making you want to cheer and cry at once. And so the healing begins amid despair.  With the cruel truth outed, there can be no doubt...that a unified future is theirs.  Nothing heartless here, except  the way Heather leaves Josh in the lurch, when he reveals his own horrific secret. Just her own pain taking the reins, and it literally drives him off a cliff. But then she gets back on the horse, and sweeps Josh up with her, smart girl.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Thoroughly Enjoyable", "text": "A friend of mine began telling me about this book months ago -- he said it was funny, entertaining, cleverly written and that it completely changed his perception of perfume (in this review, by the way, I'm using the words \"perfume,\" \"cologne\" and \"scent\" interchangeably.) In fact, after reading this book, my friend went online and purchased several of the five-star perfumes so that he could smell them (and wear them) himself.<br /><br />\"What could be so fascinating about perfume?\" I wondered, so I got a copy of the book myself. I began casually flipping through it at first, looking up old favorite and the two fragrances I currently own (gifts from friends). An hour passed. And then another. I couldn't put the book down! When I finally did close the pages, I went to my tiny collection of cologne, put on a bit of my favorite (Gucci pour Homme), and enjoyed the fragrance with completely new appreciation. Turin described it as a \"liturgical frangrance\" and I realized it was a pitch-perfect description -- smoky and incense-like. I could practically see the thurifer swinging the thurible (okay, so I exaggerate, but you gotta love that liturgical-speak).<br /><br />I can see why the reviews for this book are mixed -- I suppose perfume is like anything else, personal taste varies wildly from person to person. I haven't yet found a personal favorite of mine that hasn't been favorably reviewed in this book, but I wouldn't take it personally if I loved a cologne and the authors hated it. I'm also impressed by the fact that some of the most favorably reviewed perfumes are among the least expensive brands.<br /><br />This book laid to rest some of my own questions about the colognes I'd like to buy: Does perfume expire? Is it always gender-specific? How should it be stored?<br /><br />I have one mild quibble with the book -- the authors compare other, lesser, scents to Baldessarini by Hugo Boss no less than three times. Eager to read about this apparently wonderful scent (after all, they think so highly of it that they use is as the basis of comparison) I pored through the book looking for that review. It's not reviewed!! I kept thinking I was missing it, but alas, I can only infer from their secondhand praise that this is a scent worth checking out. C'mon, don't tease me, review Baldessarini already!<br /><br />All in all, I've really learned a lot from this book, and truly enjoy the writing style.

When I started it, I was not aware that it was the 4th in a series.  As such, I was absolutely creeped out by the step-siblings romantic relationship.  Perhaps this is becaue I didn't have the background from the previous books, but there is something about repeatedly calling Tolliver her \"brother\" and then describing their sexual relationship that is seriously disturbing.<br /><br />I thought that the \"mystery\" was not very well thought-out and loosely tied together in the end.  I did develop an interest in the ongoing storyline about her sister Cameron, but I failed to care about the other secondary characters who were in danger or died as a result of the intrigue.  Harper Connelly is an interesting character, a la Sookie Stackhouse: talented, smart, caring, and tough (but vulnerable).<br /><br />Bottom line: the step-siblings and their romantic relationship was enough to put me off the book, and the storyline didn't do much to bring me back.", "images": [], "asin": "0425230155", "parent_asin": "0425230155", "user_id": "AHZEQO4PUICOT5UHBXQVMJQQDNKA", "timestamp": 1260976185000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A book about the business of rock 'n roll, not the music", "text": "I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is well researched and extensively detailed. On the other, much of this information is hardly bias-free, being shared with the author by Klein's son, Jody, in the hope that Goodman's biography will change the public perception. (That perception, basically, was that Allen Klein was a talented businessman--as a manager of some of the most important musicians of the 1960s and 1970s--but one who bilked major music artists out of fortunes, while still increasing the percent of earnings the artists themselves were earning. Klein was a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a man--and his story is a &#34;mixed bag&#34; as a biography.)<br /><br />Klein is quite a character-- a Jewish boy who spent some of his childhood in an orphanage and much of the rest, passed around experiencing the &#34;school of hard knocks&#34;. He emerged a tough, shrewd guy who learned to be an accountant and wasn't afraid to give unwelcome financial news to clients--even when they were members of the Mafia.  This tough-talking street savvy guy seemed perfect as a business manager for musicians and it's mainly on his relationships as the manager for many legends that this book concentrates. Among them are Bobby Darin, Sam Cooke, The Who, Donovan, Dave Clark, and - of course- per the title, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles (the latter, only after they had stopped performing as a group).<br /><br />If the rock and roll business and its history interests you, you may enjoy Klein's story. For me, there just wasn't enough about the musicians or the music (other than confirming my feeling that I'd like Paul McCartney in person. The other Beatles, urged on by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were on board for Klein as their manager. But McCartney didn't like or trust him--as it turned out, with good reason--and this division was part of what precipitated their breakup, per Goodman).<br /><br />My review is mixed just as my feelings about Klein are mixed. Again, the good thing is that Klein found so many artists who were in terrible financial contracts and extricated them then made their music more profitable for them than before. On the other hand, he took a lot of these new-found profits for himself and, much worse imo, he took the rights to their songs for himself and in most cases they were unable to get them back. In 1970, the Stones fired him, only to discover that he owned many of their songs and records. He did the same to the Beatles and they learned the same thing. He went to prison in 1979 for tax evasion but only served two months.<br /><br />Writing-wise, this is very detailed--sometimes too much so in describing people Klein interacted with--but he never really &#34;came alive&#34; to me in the telling. Perhaps it was because the author--so close to the son--is guarded in how negative to make Klein appear but as a result, it seems kind of flat and doesn't really &#34;ring true&#34;. I didn't see any interviews with McCartney (who didn't trust him--and was right) or Jagger (who hated Klein's guts for ripping them off) and their versions of events might have given this book the passion and emotion it otherwise lacked by, in my opinion, trying to gloss over a bit of what Klein really was and what he did.", "images": [], "asin": "0547896867", "parent_asin": "0547896867", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1434519867000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "I would recommend this book, but I would urge readers to keep an open mind and go into like I did- with very low expectations.", "text": "Three and a half stars.<br /><br />I preordered this book long before it came out. When there were issues with shipping from Amazon, I began hearing all of the backlash so I cancelled my order and requested it from the library instead. Because I had time to hear so much backlash and such, my expectations going into this were extremely low. Still, before I started reading, I made sure to get in the right mindset- totally open mind, not expecting much, etc.<br /><br />Obviously, there were some issues.<br /><br />It most definitely felt like a fan fiction more than a piece of work from J.K. Rowling. From time to time, I also felt that there were just so many things that were overlooked that this seemed almost like a rough draft, like it was very rushed. So I had issues with flow and the things just didn\u2019t line up with the original series... They were all things that Rowling should have caught and fixed...Examples:<br /><br />Using magic on Platform 9 3/4 in his third year- did they lower the age of magic outside of school grounds? Or does the platform count as school grounds?<br /><br />Suddenly having Polyjuice potion available rather than taking the month to brew- Was that a mistake? Did potions improve so it was available faster? Why wasn\u2019t that explained if so?<br /><br />How they were in the library and then seemed to go straight to the girls bathroom, but suddenly Albus has Gillyweed\u2026they must have made an off-stage stop. And Albus didn\u2019t tell Scorpius what he was getting..?<br /><br />Also, some of the dialogue wording seemed a little off, like there were words missing in some sentences.<br /><br />There were also a handful of weird things that didn't line up with the characters. Like how simply Hermione hid an item that she knew was very dangerous in the wrong hands (she's brilliant, shouldn't she have hidden it better?!) I also really didn't like how Ron was portrayed the majority of the time... Sometimes he was good old goofy Ron, but others he seemed like too much of a doofus.<br /><br />I also don\u2019t understand the Part 1 and Part 2\u2026was this play seen on two different days? The break between Part 1 and Part 2 doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026unless that marked the intermission of the play? But why title the book that way as well?<br /><br />I straight up HATE that it is being called \u201cHarry Potter Eight\u201d \u201cThe Eighth Story\u201d. Why couldn\u2019t it just be a one off? Why did it have to be merged with the series? It\u2019s not the same. If this was an actual novel that was fully written, I could see it being called book eight\u2026but no. It\u2019s a play and it was written by different people. It really seemed like Rowling only provided a weak outline.<br /><br />All that said\u2026.I tried to take this as it was and not think to much about it. So overall, I actually really enjoyed this play! I believe that if I had read this when it first came out, my thoughts would have been a bit different. But I thought it was exciting, I enjoyed the characters (LOVED SCORPIUS!) , and I could really see the play coming to life. I wish I could have seen this preformed in London!", "images": [], "asin": "1338099132", "parent_asin": "1338099132", "user_id": "AHPJFSRMWDXQ6UKYAR4SZERD2JQA", "timestamp": 1476369098000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Collin is a bold, brash rogue who lacks Faith's devout faith in God. When Collin begins secretly courting Faith's younger sister, Charity, she isn't sure her heart can handle it. After circumstances bring them together a couple of times, Collin begins to realize he has feelings for Faith as well.<br /><br />When America joins World War 1, Collin is sent to battle along with Faith's father Patrick and her brother Sean. Her mother returns to Ireland with the rest of her children to wait out the war. In Ireland, Faith meets Mitch and, thinking that Collin is lost to her forever, lets herself fall in love. When Charity's conniving nature comes between Faith and Mitch, Faith returns to America.<br /><br />I enjoyed this terrific book about family, loyalty and love. Julie Lessman has crafted a delightful story about real people: Christians who are human and struggle with the human desires of passion and anger and hate. Faith is determined to keep herself pure and worthy of a strong God-blessed marriage like her parents have. She struggles against her attraction to Collin, especially when Collin takes advantage of some solitary situations, and Faith must fight her passions.<br /><br />A bit long, the story covers a lot of ground in Boston as well as in Ireland. The tension was such that you really don't know who is going to win Faith's heart until the very end. I liked Faith, I liked Collin. I loved her parents, Marcy and Patrick. I hated Charity and given that the second book in the series is about Charity, I hope she redeems herself.<br /><br />There is preaching as well as multiple scripture references, which are understandable, given the subject matter.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Like Seeing an Old Friend Again After a Long Separation", "text": "I have really enjoyed this series - now up to number 12 I think with this installment. It is unique in many ways and teaches many lessons about life.<br /><br />When I first heard about the series, it was on book 6. It worked out well, because I had so many books to read without having to wait. Now, I am all caught up, so the year between books seems like a very long time. It is like having to wait before getting to see an old friend again - well, the old friend in this case has come back for a visit!<br /><br />Besides the more obvious things like the great characters in the series - after a while they seem like you actually know them as you would real people - what I really liked about the series is the detail about Botswana and life there. And so much of it is positive, unlike so much of what you hear about Africa these days. The books also teach many lessons useful to people everywhere, but from a Botswana/African perspective that can really shine a light where it needs to shine sometimes.<br /><br />The first book was especially good in portraying the Botswana background and viewpoint - I assume accuracy here as the author lived there a long time. The author seemed to move away from this as the series progressed; a disappointment for me, even though the books were still interesting. The good news is that I think the author is headed back in the right direction here with the last few books.<br /><br />As an aside, the TV series is great too; last time I looked into the matter, it does not look like the series with continue into a second season, but there is talk of a movie which is better than nothing. Most of the characters in the TV series were about as I had pictured them from the book - the main exception being Mma Makutsi. The actress that played her did a great job though; she just looked a little different from how I had pictured her from the book.<br /><br />Now on to the new book itself. I am happy to see that this new book stays closer to the series roots in many respects showing us some more about the real Botswana. The overall plot seems very vigorous too. I won't go into that too much as readers usually like a surprise, but here's a look at main story lines in the new book without giving things away.<br /><br />Remember the tiny white van that Mma Precious Ramotswe has been so attached to in the series? It is gone, but she is seeing visions of it. Hmm, that sounds like an interesting phenomenon. Where will this go? You'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />At a cattle post, two cows have been killed, and Mma Ramotswe is asked to investigate. Lots of suspects as it turns out, making it a challenge for our favorite Botswanan lady detective. Does she solve the mystery? No spoilers here, you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />One of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's apprentices may have gotten a girl pregnant; he runs away when pressure builds to marry her. Will those young men ever finish their apprenticeships and stay out of trouble?<br /><br />The \"villianess\", Violet Sephotho, is back. Remember her? She did horribly at the secretarial college when Mma Makutsi was there and shows up now and then to make poor Grace miserable. Anyway, Violet is running for the Botswana Parliament. They'd have to be desperate to elect her. What is up with this? Well, you'll have to open up the book to find out.<br /><br />And a perfect pair of wedding shoes - series fans will be pretty sure that the \"shoephile\" Mma Makutsi must be involved with those. Will Phuti Radiphuti finally marry Grace? The title of the book seems to refer to a wedding happening, but will it be Grace's or for the run away apprentice? Again, I won't tell here - you'll have to read the book.<br /><br />Lots of interesting things are in store for readers here. I hope that series fans will come back and read this latest book, meet favorite characters again, be entertained, and learn something about Botswana and life in general as well.", "images": [], "asin": "030737839X", "parent_asin": "030737839X", "user_id": "AHFRMLWCPZ6HCCCXBVH5KNDZJVSA", "timestamp": 1300777369000, "helpful_vote": 84, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Don't Judge This Book by its Movie", "text": "Most readers have heard by now that Fifteen-year-old Christopher Paolini began writing Eragon in a notebook while sitting on the couch.  His youth can be seen in his writing, his plot is at times clich\u00e9d and often formulaic.  However, having said that, I enjoyed the novel.  The setting Paolini creates is comprehensive, with detailed back-story, geography and laws that rule his imaginary world.  (Yes, some of these laws are borrowed from other authors.)  The characters of this world, in comparison to the movie are much fuller and more developed.  Paolini has stated that he carefully plotted the story and I did find it formulaic but also classic.<br /><br />Like any author he has read and was clearly influenced by other fantasy and science fiction authors.  Others have criticized Paolini for incorporating ideas from other authors into his work.  I would agree that he obviously does this and, from a more mature author, I would expect more subtlety.  He is open about many of the authors that have influenced him and lists some on his website.<br /><br />Eragon is not fantasy in the class of The Lord of the Rings or The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe but I asked myself, would I have enjoyed this book if I had known nothing about the author?  My answer is yes.  For me his youth only adds to the enjoyment I receive from his work.  To have created a fine story while only a teenager makes me wonder what he will achieve in twenty years.<br /><br />As I suggested earlier, I did not find the movie enjoyable but Eragon, the book, is an excellent first novel by a fine new author.  I look forward to Eldest and all his future stories.<br /><br />Recommendation: Read the book but skip the movie.<br /><br />Kyle Pratt", "images": [], "asin": "0375826688", "parent_asin": "0375826688", "user_id": "AGPUPA5675FZEGLUSRAS5HO6KX4A", "timestamp": 1178600316000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Interesting", "text": "To be frank, this book was an impulsive purchase. I saw it at the bookstore some years ago, and bought it after scanning briefly through it. Of course, like most impulsive book purchases, it wound up sitting on my shelf until last week. Buckley makes a strong showing in this book as a political satirist, however his ability to craft a story has something to be desired. He was able to capture my attention for hours at a time with this book, but the I found myself dragging my feet through the last fifty pages or so: I kept asking myself if something was going to happen of any particular significance. While Buckely himself is a mediocre writer, his jokes and usage of intertextuality makes him interesting to read.<br />The premise of this book is interesting enough, and gives Buckley an excellent jumping-off point to plunge the reader into a hilarious rendition of Alien abductees who finally have their day in the sun. The national issue of UFOs and alien contact is brought to the forefront of US media after a prominant televisoin host, Jack Banion, is abducted twice by a top-secret US Government collective, Majestic 12. It is clear that Buckley did his research; he intertwines this story with many references to various conspiracy theories.<br />Banion, the protagonist, finds himself falling from grace - he is no longer on Washington DC's A-list. Rather, he becomes the champion of UFO wackos, people who come in throngs claiming to have been abducted. While the story line continues upon a predicatble path, the ending had something to be desired. Additionally, for such an excellent premise, Buckley really fails to do anything phenomenal with it.<br />That being said, \"Little Green Men\" is not without its merits. While it was initially difficult to get into, after the first two-dozen pages I found myself smirking and, yes, even laughing aloud to what was said by Buckley. His political commentary falls middle-of-the-road, and while he does dish out a few low-brown sex jokes (probably pandering to the \"People\" magazine crowd), his humor does have some fine points. His continual parodies of government officials as bumbling fools become tiresome (if not already cliche before opening the book itself), but overall a worthy effort.", "images": [], "asin": "0060955570", "parent_asin": "0060955570", "user_id": "AFSXURUPP7MZOAJUJPPQBJBXX45A", "timestamp": 1077761971000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

J. Watson\u2019s Before I Go To Sleep is an intriguing, compelling story of a woman in search of herself. Perhaps half its power lies in the fact that we\u2019re all, in one sense or another, searching for identity. With no knowledge of the woman\u2019s condition, readers empathize quickly and enter her fears. Are we accepted or fooled? Are we loved or used? Are we rising toward hope or condemned to eternal nonentity?<br /><br />Christine\u2019s journal shifts from love to hope to fear and back again, running the gamut of emotions day by day. The author weaves past and present together beautifully, giving both that ring of uncertain truth as lies intervene with malicious or honest intent. The stories balance perfectly, keeping the reader unsettled, never quite guessing, always hoping, and waiting for the end.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent \"how-to\" introduction to digital scrapbooking", "text": "I've become increasingly drawn to digital scrapbooking. Traditional scrapbooking is cool, but I don't want to get heavily involved with all the supplies, needing to clear out a space and so on. So it's digital scrapbooking for me. I am an experienced user of Photoshop, Illustrator and other graphics editing and design software.<br /><br /> So why do I find an introductory book like this so appealing? Because scrapbooking is an art form unlike what I've done in the past. I need to develop new ways of seeing and not be bound by the restrictions of the kind of stuff I've been doing.<br /><br /> The authors provide that introduction based around Photoshop Elements (\"PE\"), a trial copy of which is on the included CD, but you'll want to download the current trial version from Adobe's site.<br /><br /> They take you through all the main features of using PE, but everything is centered on digitally scrapbooking.<br /><br /> The approach is very casual. Quick basic introductions first to camera vocabulary, cameras, scanners (and scanning ideas), printers (with an excellent short section on papers and specialty media).<br /><br /> Next is an introduction to \"Digital Layouts  101\", which is thorough, entertaining and educational. This is also a guide to your first steps in using Photoshop Elements.<br /><br /> After that, the book flows well into sections on image editing, using text, backgrounds and accents (the latter both digital and analog) and using digital kits.<br /><br /> The authors really do this well. The book is profusely illustrated with very striking and creative layouts that go beyond simply demonstrating the techniques described, but rather serve to illuminate and inspire. Unlike the work I've been doing, scrapbooking lets you throw traditional rules out the window and create to your heart's content.<br /><br /> \"Scrapbooking Digitally\" would be an excellent intro just to Photoshop Elements. Coupled with its focus on digital scrapbooking, it is an excellent introduction to both subjects.<br /><br />Jerry", "images": [], "asin": "1561589721", "parent_asin": "1561589721", "user_id": "AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA", "timestamp": 1294818530000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Bane of the Spider Queen", "text": "Originally published in 1990, R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy set in the Forgotten Realms shone like a beacon in the fantasy genre. It was, and still is, comparable to Tolkein's Lord of the Rings and Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman's Dragon Lance series and - like those - is still being sold in nearly every major bookstore today.<br /><br />Then, in 2005, Devil's Due Publishing (traditionally known for their G.I. Joe and Transformers comics) began releasing a comic adaptation of the story with a script by Andrew Dabb and wonderfully detailed pencils by Tim Seeley.<br /><br />Naturally the full plot of the novels can't be fit into three trade paperbacks, but all of the essentials are still there. We can see the development, decline and eventual resolution of the relationship between Drizzt Do'Urden and his father Zaknafein and, most importantly, the bond between Drizzt and the ever-faithful Guenhwyvar, his panther companion from the astral plane.<br /><br />Drizzt was born in the underdark beneath the ground in the drow city of Menzoberranzan, a city run by the female priests of the dark spider goddess Lolth who relishes only evil and treachery. Brought up in a society so far detached from our own we would die within a day even if not for our pale skin, Drizzt is raised to be a ruthless and cunning killer.<br /><br />But Drizzt is born different from his kin and kind. He possesses an unimpeachable sense of honor despised by the spider queen who seeks only his death to \"appease\" for the good he has done, such as saving the life of a surface dweller in a drow raid aboveground.<br /><br />Rather than face certain death at the hands of his own family in order to restore their honor, Drizzt ventures out into the underdark with only Guenhwyvar at his side. But for the most reviled of the intelligent races in the realms it will be difficult to survive in the most dangerous corridors of the underdark. Thus must Drizzt journey to the surface to face a world unknown to any drow before him.<br /><br />The artwork in these comics is just astounding. Although much of the action takes place in the bleak environs of the underdark, the art remains colorful and vivid. Never have I wanted to visit a place so dangerous. The action is well wrought and never leaves you with a sense of confusion despite the numerous fights between Drizzt, who expertly wields two scimitars in battle, and the numerous horrors of the underdark and surface.<br /><br />Despite lacking the complexity and depth of the original novels, this is a series well worth adding to your collection.", "images": [], "asin": "1932796800", "parent_asin": "1932796800", "user_id": "AGJU5PF6DMO6VHT2PI5NEWCSV67Q", "timestamp": 1185203757000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Great Event of the Nineteenth Century", "text": "Abraham Lincoln issued the final version of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Near the end of that year, the artist Francis Carpenter determined to paint \"a historical picture of the first reading of the Proclamation of Emancipation\". Carpenter spent six months in the White House beginning in February, 1864, created a historically important painting of the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to the cabinet, got to know Lincoln, and wrote a book detailing his experiences. Carpenter wrote that Lincoln told him regarding the Emancipation Proclamation: \"It is the central act of my administration, and the great event of the nineteenth century\".<br /><br />Professor Allen Guelzo tells the story of the Carpenter painting (p. 220-21), includes a photograph of the painting in the book, discusses Lincoln's statement to Carpenter (p. 186) and includes much more in his detailed study, \"Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America\" (2004). This book is a worthy successor to Professor Guelzo's recent study of Lincoln's religious and political beliefs in \"Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President\".<br /><br />Professor Guelzo takes issue with a historical interpretation of the Emancipation Proclamation beginning with Richard Hofstadter (1948) that argues that Lincoln had little concern with the status of black Americans and issued the Emancipation Proclamation only from reasons of prudence to protect the interests of white workers. Guelzo also approaches the Emancipation Proclamation to address recent arguments by African-American scholars skeptical of Lincoln's role and pessimistic about the future of race relations in the United States.<br /><br />Professor Guelzo agrees that Lincoln approached the question of Emancipation cautiously. He offers several reasons for this caution. One major reason was Lincoln's fear of the reaction of the Federal courts to an attempt by the Executive to emancipate the slaves. Lincoln had good grounds for this concern as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roger Taney, was the author of the notorious Dred Scott decision. Lincoln also had to act with the concerns of the border states in mind as these states were critical to the Union war effort; and he had to contend with generals and a substantial portion of the population of the North that would oppose any attempt to turn the Civil War from a war to preserve the Union to a war to free the slaves. To circumvent these obstacles, Lincoln proposed a system of compensated emancipation and asked the border states to adopt such a plan with Federal financial assistance. He also wanted to explore voluntary colonization efforts under which the freed slaves would be colonized in central America or in a location in the Western United States.<br /><br />Professor Guelzo describes how the border states resisted any notion of compensated emancipation. He also describes Federal legislative efforts, and efforts of some Union commanders, to protect former slaves making their way to the Union lines. These slaves were described by the term \"contraband\" and Congress enacted two limited statutes, called \"Confiscation Acts\" providing freedom for the \"contrabands.\"<br /><br />In 1862, Lincoln told Secretary of State Seward and, ultimately, the rest of the cabinet, that he had determined to free the slaves in the rebellious states. Although not a believer in any traditional sense, Lincoln stated that this course was forced upon him by God and Providence. He issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in September 22, 1862 and the final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863.<br /><br />Professor Guelzo describes the origins of the Proclamation, and the effect of its issuance on the Union, the Confederacy, the free blacks, and the slaves. He also describes the impact of the Proclamation on the foreign affairs of the United States and on the conduct of the War -- as is well known, following the Proclamation the Civil War changed in character to total warfare. He describes the precarious legal basis for the Emancipation Proclamation and points to Lincoln's courage and determination in the face of doubt. Although some scholars have argued that the Proclamation had, in fact, no legal effect and freed no slaves, Professor Guelzo argues persuasively that it was and remains the pivotal event of the Civil War and the single most important factor in the destruction of slavery.<br /><br />Following Lincoln's assassination, the Freedmen from the Southern states contributed funds for the construction of a statue of Lincoln emancipating a slave. The statue stands in Lincoln Park in Washington, D.C. It was dedicated in 1872, with remarks by Frederick Douglass. (I was moved to visit Lincoln Park to see the statue after hearing Professor Guelzo speak last year at a conference in Washington.) Douglass described Lincoln as \"a white man who shared the prejudices common to his countrymen towards the colored race.\" (p. 249) Yet he recognized that, in issuing the Proclamation Lincoln was \"swift, zealous, radical, and determined.\" (p. 250) In Professor Guelzo's words, the Emancipation Proclamation was \"an act of spectacular political daring\" (p.249)<br /><br />This is a thorough, well-balanced, yet inspiring study, of what indeed has fair title to be the Great Event of the Nineteenth Century. The book will help the reader understand where our country has been in securing racial justice and in bringing to pass and expanding upon the American dream.<br /><br />Robin Friedman", "images": [], "asin": "0743221826", "parent_asin": "0743221826", "user_id": "AENBSJOBQIUYW5UK3ESTAF7ECSGA", "timestamp": 1081787486000, "helpful_vote": 41, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Of Choices and Word Paintings", "text": "L.M. Ross's The Moanin' After is a book about choices--choosing to live, choosing to die, and choosing to forgive.  In this, Ross's second novel, we follow his protagonist David on his harrowing journey through grief.  Ross beautifully shows us that grief is not a solitary process.  David touches lives in his quest to understand and accept the deaths of his friends Face Depina and, most importantly, Tyrone Hunter.<br /><br />And author Ross also makes choices.  Ross has grown as a writer since his first novel.  In it, Manhood The Longest Moan, Ross used his gloriously beautiful figures of speech to excess.  He created six or eight metaphors, similes, etc., and strung them together.  In The Moanin' After, Ross wisely chooses the two or three best of his creations to make his points.  And he makes them amazingly.  The reader can revel in his descriptions.  A poet at heart, Ross knows his subjects:  jazz, New York City, gay life, and what it means to be a Black man.  His word portraits rapturously evoke, sometimes bringing chills down the spine.<br /><br />If anyone deserves a deal with a major publisher, it is Ross.  An editor at Little Brown, Simon and Schuster, Clarion, or any of the other \"big\" publishers could work with Ross and turn him from a very good writer into a great one.  The man knows how to use words in a commanding and beautiful way.  He truly deserves better than his present editor and publisher.<br /><br />His current publisher apparently is dedicated to bringing African-American writers to the marketplace.  What a fine and noble goal!  But when every page has five to fifteen errors, how can this publisher be taken seriously?  The reader is forced to wade through sentences filled with repeated words and words left out.  Time and time again, verbs of two different tenses (think \"was\"/ \"were\") are both given, as if the reader might want a choice in the sentence.  Or could it be the editor or proofreader couldn't make the choice him or herself?  And the commas!  My lord, my lord...they are just thrown in willy-nilly.  Someone needs to send this editor a grammar book--STAT!<br /><br />L.M. Ross needs to be read, not decoded.  If there is a publishing god out there, please let Her send an angel to plop Ross's next manuscript on the desk of an editor familiar with the English language.<br /><br />Ross serves the gay community, the Black community, and the community at large with his humanity and his word paintings.  Read The Moanin' After--it has power and grace.  And after you read it, pass your copy on to your publisher friend...you know, the one who sits in an ivory tower office in Manhattan, waiting for the next great African-American author.", "images": [], "asin": "1933967358", "parent_asin": "1933967358", "user_id": "AEZEFRB2AQ2EXQ3ZKPLAB7SSL6QA", "timestamp": 1211126938000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Slow moving but intriguing premise of disturbing psychological influence", "text": "This book is suspenseful in a very slow way. I found the premise intriguing- participating in a psychological experiment of sorts that becomes a little twisted and reality is blurred from the manipulation. In actuality, I wouldn\u2019t put much emphasis on the blurred reality part of the advertised summary- not really the plot. There\u2019s times Jessica wonders if an everyday encounter is part of the experiment but it\u2019s not really a \u2018is she losing her mind\u2019 kind of manipulation.<br /><br />Jessica enters a psychology study to earn more money for her family and the conductor of the study, Dr. Shields (no relation to me), takes a special interest in Jessica and asks more and more of her in future parts of the study. So there\u2019s this mystery of why Dr Shields is doing this study, why such an interest in Jessica, what happened to Subject 5, and can Dr Shields\u2019 spouse be trusted? To be honest, I was expecting darker answers to those questions than what turned out to be the case. I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I thought there would be a little more pulse-pounding action instead of neatly wrapping everything up with a bow.<br /><br />But I would still recommend this book. It was still engaging and as a psych minor, I enjoyed the psychology intertwined within, a lot of the referenced psych studies I remember from my classes. As long as you don\u2019t go into it expecting a lot of intense action and suspense I think you\u2019ll really like the story and seeing how things unfold. And it\u2019s kinda a freaky scenario to think about. The implications of something like this happening, of a therapist having such personal information and manipulating clients and having the capability to affect and influence their life is definitely worth exploring in a psychological thriller like this.<br /><br />One writing style thing to mention: the chapters alternate POVs. It\u2019s either told from Jessica\u2019s point of view (3rd person) where we can hear her thoughts or from Dr. Shields\u2019 (first person). But with Dr. Shields\u2019 chapters it\u2019s almost in letter or diary form directly addressing Jessica- which I didn\u2019t really like. It definitely makes it more creepy I suppose, but some of the vocabulary or descriptions seemed unnatural for that type of writing.<br /><br /> All in all- good book, will probably read others written by these authors.", "images": [], "asin": "1250133750", "parent_asin": "1250133750", "user_id": "AEX6GC25ANZIT36EQGUAJOGXCPLQ", "timestamp": 1600216830710, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Enjoyable tale if you read it on its own terms", "text": "Lyrically written, charming, and engaging, The Last Unicorn can be best appreciated if it is read on its own terms.  It is not a sweeping epic like any of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, nor a religious allegory like many of C.S. Lewis' works, nor a Disneyesque fairy tale with the perfunctory happy ending.  Anyone reading it and expecting some variant of these other works will be disappointed.  What The Last Unicorn does is take the traditional literary forms of the quest and the fairy tale, then stand them on their head in a very post-modern sort of way.  It does this to entice readers to ponder the philosophical questions that author Peter S. Beagle considers important.<br /><br />One certainly does not have to read The Last Unicorn in some deeply philosophical manner to enjoy it.  As a simple tale, it is entertaining enough, with wonderful prose, imagery, and characters that will stay with you for a long time.  There is the creaky witch, Mommy Fortuna, her Midnight Carnival, and the Harpy that will be her doom.  There is Schmendrick, the hapless magician, struggling to tap his inner wizard.  There is the genteel balladeer and highwayman, Captain Cully; his giant of a right-hand man, Jack Jingly; and his earthy charwoman, Molly Grue.  And, of course, there is the Unicorn herself, a majestic and magical creature, a primeval force of nature rooted in eternity itself.<br /><br />The tale itself begins with the Unicorn in her forest, discovering that she is apparently the very last Unicorn in the world. Although a solitary creature, this disturbs her greatly, so she begins a quest to find her people, leaving her beloved forest behind to travel a dangerous world.  Along the way, she meets new friends (Schmendrick, Molly Grue) who help her overcome the many ordeals and enemies that she encounters along the way.  Ultimately, the quests leads the Unicorn and her companions to the realm of King Haggard, the jaded and miserly ruler of a destitute kingdom by the sea, who may have had something to do with the disappearance of the Unicorns.  At this point, the tale makes some twists and turns, before reaching its final, bittersweet conclusion.<br /><br />Beneath the tale is a philosophical subtext that delights in exploring the answers to a variety of questions.  What is the nature of illusion?  Can we desire an illusion to be real so much that it does, in fact, become real - until its spell is broken?  What is the difference between time and eternity?  What would an eternal creature be like, and how would we react to it?  If an eternal creature could somehow be made to see things from a mortal's point of view, how would it react?  Beagle doesn't necessarily provide answers to all of these questions - at times, he just raises them for the reader to ponder.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Beagle can't resist dropping all-too-obvious hints that he is playing a friendly little game with his readers.  Anachronistic references to tacos and field recordings, a butterfly that spouts pop tunes from the 1930's, a talking skull that makes reference to \"character assassins\" - Beagle drops a number of not-so-subtle and unnecessary hints, calling the reader's attention to how he is violating the traditional norms of the literary form that he is using, and daring the reader to figure out why.  It's as if Beagle were sitting across the room from the reader, winking and smiling wryly.<br /><br />In the end, however, Beagle manages to pull off a difficult literary feat - creating a simple and enjoyable story that can be read at a deeper, more philosophical level.  The reader can approach it in either way and take something away from his work.  While it doesn't have quite the same emotional resonance for me as (say) any of Tolkien's works, the Last Unicorn deserves its status as a modern literary classic.", "images": [], "asin": "0451450523", "parent_asin": "0451450523", "user_id": "AHP2EAWCFQ2EC3F2Z7EZ6V7XLUVQ", "timestamp": 1297880414000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "History with the eye of the fiction author", "text": "This is not a traditional history book and it seems that those who object seem to do so primarally on those grounds.  There is no question that this book does not read or even flow as a typical history which in my view is a tribute to the creative author and a a risk taking publisher both of whom deserve high praise.<br /><br />It is the reader rather than a historian who benefit from this treatment.  The myriad of detail adds color and depth to the men's characters in a way that no regular history book has ever done.  Yes the detail slows the narative and yes the author is all over the place, retrospection, current event, future writing all withing a page or two and yet somehow the whole thing holds together and the information is assimilated in a lasting and meaningful way.<br /><br />The reasonings are so logical and fresh given the years and speculation and outright lies that they shine from the page.  One example - why was Custer not scalped.  Reasons given over the years run from Indian admiration for his courage to contempt.  The author's take,  Custer's hair was cut short for the campain, he was also going bald.  In short his scalp was so unatractive as a trophy, that no one bothered.<br /><br />The author engages in speculation and unlike regular historians, he readily admits when he is doing so.  For example he openly shared his puzzlement as to why certain versions of Custer's death are rejected by one generation only to be viewed as the most credible by furture generations.<br /><br />All and all this is a wonderful read and anyone with an interest in this history would benefit even if some of the facts shared conflict with previous ideas.<br /><br />Custer remains an inegma but this book comes as close as we are ever likely to get to understanding him and the men who served with him.", "images": [], "asin": "0883940884", "parent_asin": "0883940884", "user_id": "AHG6C6TFMFKIOQHSOZEYKPNTAFOA", "timestamp": 1179300028000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

I absolutely love the vulgar in this one LOL. This book is a little smaller than a normal sheet of paper but the designs in it are awesome if you like to swear. There is a lot of detail to color on each page so this book will definitely keep you busy for awhile. What a great way to de-stress after work or a long or rough day.<br /><br />The pages are all one sided which I prefer. If using markers or gel pens, I definitely recommend placing a few sheets of blank paper in between the pages so they don't mark through. The page thickness is that of a normal piece of computer paper roughly. The pages are not perforated so they will not tear out unless you just rip them out neatly if you wanted to remove any.<br /><br />Overall, this is my favorite Sweary Coloring Book I have to date. Some of the books claim to have a lot of vulgar in them but they don't. this has a lot of &quot;colorful words&quot; in it that are just awesome! In my video, I show all the pages that come in the book so you can see everything in it and decide if it's for you.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Enjoyable detective story with some juicy courtroom scenes.", "text": "Harry Bosch has lost his job as a homicide detective for the LAPD (again) and is at loose ends. At the same time Harry's half-brother, attorney Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer), is defending former gang member Da'Quan Foster, who's accused of raping and murdering assistant city manager Lexi Park.<br /><br />Mickey is convinced his client was set up and asks Harry to look into the case. Harry refuses because the idea of 'crossing' from catching criminals to helping them get off is abhorrent to him. Nevertheless, Harry takes a look at the LAPD's murder book and gets an inkling that Da'Quan might actually be innocent. The clue that intrigues Harry most is Lexi's expensive watch, which is missing.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two LAPD detectives have an inordinate interest in the Lexi Park case. They spy on Mickey and Harry, stop Mickey for a bogus DUI so they can search his car, and track the half-brothers with GPS devices. Then, when Harry starts to investigate the missing watch, more people are murdered. It's clear that something is rotten in the LAPD.<br /><br />The book moves along at a steady clip as Harry uncovers one clue after another, and builds to a satisfying climax. Full disclosure: I did get a tad impatient with a couple of sections about LAPD parking lots and gangs surveilling them, but this is a minor quibble.<br /><br />The secondary characters add interest to the book, including Harry's daughter Maddie - who's preparing for college, Harry's former partner Lucia - who secretly lends him a hand, and an Internal Affairs investigator that Harry has sparks with.<br /><br />The last part of the book has some juicy courtroom scenes (courtesy of Mickey Haller), which is icing on the cake of a good detective novel.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I don't get it...", "text": "Gee, so much hype about this book, how could I not read it? But now that I'm finished, I can't undrstand the hype...<br /><br />The story began well, with enough intrigue to make me wonder what the heck was wrong with this picture. And the language of the story (the writing itself) was very pleasing to follow.  But about half way through, after we discovered what was really happening with Amy, the plot became (in my opinion) implausible and a little silly.  The mystery started off seriously enough but then deviated into a soap opera tale of !megalomaniacal treachery! None of the potential plot lines from first part of the story were developed into anything diabolical ( e.g. the purchase of the gun, Nick's father's strange behavior at the housewarming, Amy's cryptic friendship with Noelle)--most of the mystery was dropped altogether--and then all of a sudden I was forced to accept an unbelievable (& I mean really not believable) turn of events unfitting of the characters thus far developed.  It was not like &#34;Wow! I didn't see THAT coming!!&#34; , it was more like &#34;No way! It wouldn't (or shouldn't) happen like that!!&#34;<br /><br />Another issue for me, that I realized about 3/4 of the way through, was that the main characters, Nick and Amy, were falsely developed. The first part of the story portrayed them, in depth, to be certain personalities, but then those were discarded in exchange for the more wicked traits of the revealed characters. I understand that this was supposed to be the big twist, but the second-part Nick and Amy were never really fleshed out to make them believable.  I felt as if I never had a grasp on Nick's character at all--was he a handsome streetwise literary? A small-minded, small-town dullard? A scheming, twisted match for his sociopathic wife? How was Amy ever beautiful and gracious, if she was only ever calculative and malevolent? And at what point did they become poison for each other? I was never made to understand how their relationship became a &#34;sick, toxic M&ouml;bius strip&#34;:  that would suggest long-standing dysfunction, but that part of their story was not written here.  I felt that, in order to appreciate the grand turn-of-events, I had to blindly accept that Amy, and to an extent, Nick, were, and had always been, evil.<br /><br />I have many other small issues with the plot, and was perplexed by the resignation of the ending, but suffice it to say that a story with great potential for intrigue and complexity veered off to become a typical bland, superficial, best-seller-list mystery (in my opinion).", "images": [], "asin": "B006LSZECO", "parent_asin": "B006LSZECO", "user_id": "AG6XDAZEEV7W5OBEIFHLMTQ7UJGQ", "timestamp": 1368768470000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

America 1844: Religious Fervor, Westward Expansion, and the Presidential Election that Transformed the Nation by John Bicknell follows the various strands of events that were independent of one another yet influenced each other with long term consequences.<br /><br />In the United States the year of 1844 was already going to be important due to the upcoming Presidential Election, yet the political maneuvering by the President without a party John Tyler would entirely change the upcoming campaign.  Through attempts to put potential rivals on the Supreme Court to kickstarting the issue of the annexation of Texas, Tyler\u2019s actions aided by southern slave-owning politicians upended the Presidential campaign as little-known Tennessean James K. Polk took the Democratic nomination to face off with longstanding Whig stalwart Henry Clay whose self-imposed wounds would help cost him the White House and change American history.  Another politically costly mistake for Clay and the Whigs was cozying up to nativists whose mob violence against Catholics particularly in Philadelphia not only sent the Catholic vote to the Democrats but also future Irish Catholic immigrants to New York and Boston.  A candidate for President that many today did not know ran was the founder of the Church of Latter-Day Saints, Joseph Smith, who to protect his followers ran to bring their constitutional rights to the fore only for an anti-Mormon mob to storm the jail he was housed in and kill him.  The resulting succession crisis led to Brigham Young\u2019s ascension to leadership and later his decision to head to the Great Salt Lake.  Young\u2019s decision was based on the pamphlets written by John C. Fremont explored the uncharted western portions of the North American continent along with numerous emigres journeying from the East to the West for a better more prosperous future.  And yet some Americans believed a better future was not on Earth but in Heaven as they eagerly anticipated the Second Coming based on the teachings of William Miller and his associates, while confused after the passing of Miller\u2019s belief it would occur in the spring of that year the news that Miller had been off by seven months ignited hope throughout the extended Millerite community only for the Great Disappointment of October 22 to bring confusion to their beliefs.  By the end of the year the course of America\u2019s future would be set, the expansion westward would cause war with Mexican and later Civil War that would uproot slavery while allowing the two largest indigenous American founded religions to grow and expand in the Church of Latter-Day Saints and the Seventh-day Adventist church, the largest successor of the Millerite movement.<br /><br />Bicknell covers all the above in almost 260 pages, attempting\u2014for the most part successfully\u2014to give cover the year chronologically through separating themes in each chapter.  The overall history is generally correct and the addition of journeys of western pioneers gives the book more \u201clife\u201d then the sometimes stall retellings of political maneuverings back in the 19th Century.  There are some little nitpick items related to the Millerites' \u201cspring disappointment\u201d, but nothing that is majorly erroneous.<br /><br />America 1844 is a concise look at 366 days in the life of the United States that saw it\u2019s political and religious life changed dramatically with significant influence on the future, not only immediately but long term.", "images": [], "asin": "1613738811", "parent_asin": "1613738811", "user_id": "AFLGBVEMLLK253RZFCAKA224C4GA", "timestamp": 1609346999480, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Still One Of The Most Important Books On The Subject", "text": "Mark Lane stands as one of the most important and first individuals to bring attention to the America people the injustice that was served with the so called \"Warren Commission\" with his book Rush to Judgement. Over the years Mr. Lane has written several books related to the subject of JFK's assassination. I consider Rush to Judgement and Plausible Denial to be his best works, with the former documenting the inconsistencies of the Warren Commission's findings. Rush to Judgement could be describe as \"Ground Zero\" for those interested in knowing about the wool the US Government tried to pull over our eyes. Lane illustrates how, in a matter of simple law, the case against Oswald would not have a jury ruling in the favor of guilty.<br /><br />If you are just getting started on the subject of Kennedy's assassination, Rush to Judgement along with Jim Mars book \"Crossfire\" would be my first recommendations in the way of books to read on the subject. In the case of Mark Lane, he is not just an author on the death of JFK. Rather Lane is an actual person of history and part of the story that continues to be relative to current events.<br /><br />Read this book and ask yourself - How could we allow our form of elected government to perpetrate a charade of such magnitude on the people of American?", "images": [], "asin": "1560250437", "parent_asin": "1560250437", "user_id": "AGV7PGVB5GKH4AS5PPO7KUHIV32Q", "timestamp": 1353686271000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Interesting, but irritating", "text": "Migs Over North Vietnam provides a rare look at the philosophy, records, and environment of the North Vietnamese airforce.  I do not know of any other source for this type of information, and this makes this book worth reading.  The book makes several interesting claims.  For example, Vietnamese records show that many U.S. plane losses--which the U.S. attributed to SAM's--were actually downed by Mig-launched air-to-air missles.  This significantly lowers the fighter vs. fighter kill ratio claimed by American air forces. He clarifies the mythical Colonel Toon, and introduces us to the real heros of the North Vietnamese airforce.  However, Mr. Boniface goes on to claim that the North Vietnamese Airforce never truely lost control of their airspace and won a strategic victory in the air.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mr. Boniface does not contest the attitude of the North Vietnamese that everything went according to their plan and that they won the air war.  However, using his own figures, one can calculate that 50% of all Vietnamese Mig pilots and 42% of all Vietnamese Migs were lost during the 9-year span covered by the book.  Furthermore, by his own admission, the North Vietnamese airforce was often unable to respond for several months at a time on several different occassions due to severe attrition of its personnel and resources.  I don't think that North Vietnam won the war on the ground or in the air.  I think that North Vietnam won the political and propoganda war.  Mr. Boniface's irritating rhetoric is helping to keep the latter victory alive.", "images": [], "asin": "0811706966", "parent_asin": "0811706966", "user_id": "AH5QSVDBGBPOWQRRJGNFEDSU4WLQ", "timestamp": 1302808245000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Pleasurable Romp for Those Familiar with Norse Mythos", "text": "I am a Lokean devotee and a lover of all things readable, so I am always on the hunt for any new Loki-themed books I can get my hands on.<br /><br />I'm happy to say \"Father of Monsters\" did not disappoint! It's a fun, fast-paced adventure through the world of Norse mythology, with plenty of clever twists on the old stories. If you aren't familiar with most of the Norse pantheon, the characters and their motivations may be a little hard to grasp, as this story picks up around events that took place near the latter half of the myths' timeline. If you have a general idea of the gods' roles and history, though, it is plenty easy to grasp.<br /><br />The story is fast-paced and smooth, following Loki on his journeys between Asgard, the realm of the Aesir gods, and Jotunheim, the realm of the magically-gifted giants. The central conflict revolves around Loki's desire for godhood, which requires he serve Odin and the other Aesir (often against the Jotun, his own people), and his love for his family, particularly his Jotun wife Angrboda and their serpent son Jormungandr.<br /><br />The story incorporates several of the most popular myths, including Thor's Journey to Utgard, The Theft of Mjolnir, Thor's Fishing Trip, and references to many others such as Loki and the Master Builder and The Death of Baldr. Rather than being a simple retelling, though, these are woven together into a new narrative that feels very true to Loki's character and gives him and the other Aesir and Jotnar a much more three-dimensional, human character than many of the myth collections do.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book fans of Loki or Norse mythology in general. It's a refreshing take on the myths we're all familiar with, and a very pleasant way to pass a few hours.", "images": [], "asin": "0578367785", "parent_asin": "0578367785", "user_id": "AGXRAH3MP553GB3M2E3FDZUXKU6A", "timestamp": 1676874584399, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Interesting relationship between religion and economics", "text": "The main argument of this book is to show that \u201cour ideas about economics and economic policy have long-standing roots in religious thinking.\u201d It appears that the influence of religious belief had a profound effect on Western economics. The book that had a most influential effect on shaping Western ideas was The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. In this book, Smith fully developed an explanation for the private-interest-leads-to-public-good idea.<br /><br />Initially Calvinist doctrines, which dominated English and Scottish religious life since the Reformation, seemed to pervade Western thinking, but eventually came into conflict with the Protestant movement that \u201cbrought new ideas about human nature, about the purpose of men and women\u2019s lives on earth, and about their destiny after their mortal lives end,\u201d according to the author. As Einstein made clear any line of creative thinking follows from and is coherent with the worldview that underlies it. An interesting point made was that the very distinction between secular and religious is a modern concept, which was unknown throughout most of human history. Throughout the discussion, we are introduced to various players, such as Thomas Hobbes, Anthony Ashley Cooper, Pierre de Boisguilbert, Bernard Mandeville, Pierre Nicole, and others.<br /><br />Getting back to Adam Smith, his first book focused on the inner thoughts of individuals, but his second book, Wealth of Nations, discussed the origins and evolution of social institutions, especially the organization of economic life. With this book, Smith \u201cassumed a place in the forefront of Enlightenment thinkers that he has held ever since.\u201d It is with this book that the fundamental basis of what is now called economics was established. But underlying this brilliant work was something else at work that was shaping the worldview. An important contribution that framed the intense and sometimes violent debate over religious ideas in which Smith lived was the teachings of John Calvin. After his death, his teaching spread rapidly within the expanding Protestant world. In time, however, as the author explains in depth, the Calvinist orthodoxy gave way to a Protestantism divorced from Calvinist ideology. These religious ideas, discussed in detail in the book, carried implications for how to think about the secular world. The author notes that \u201cnot only did the transition in thinking that set the foundation for modern economics closely follow the movement away from orthodox Calvinism in time, the two shared a logical coherence as well.\u201d These ideas came to form an essential part of the worldview that Adam Smith and others believed. By the latter half of the eighteenth century, deism was widespread in America, Scotland and England \u2013 probably the belief of Smith as well. In fact, in America the religious thinking of men such as Mather, Edwards, Cooper, and others followed the line of reasoning that \u201caccepting the moral legitimacy of self-interest while seeking a means of limiting and regulating it, was fully congruent with the view of competitive markets soon laid out by Adam Smith.\u201d By the time of the Scottish Enlightenment, religion and politics throughout most of Europe had been intertwined for over two centuries, according to the author. For example, free trade was determined to not just be practical but was a core religious imperative. Men like John McVickar and Francis Wayland felt international trade was the will of a benevolent God. It brought nations together \u2013 as God desired. Francis Bowen of Harvard, made explicit that the basis for human\u2019s behavior in the economic sphere was the will of a \u201cbenevolent God operating through Newtonian laws of nature.\u201d God\u2019s will seemed to figure in all things. The minister Jonathan Edwards thought that the millennium would start in America. Many thought the American experiment was clearly of divine origin, including political leaders. We see the contributions of numerous theologians on these matters, such as William Lawrence, Russell Conwell, Henry Ward Beecher, John Bates Clark, and others.<br /><br />Two philosophies began to emerge by the end of the nineteenth century: The Gospel of Wealth and the Social Gospel. Each reflected a powerful postmillennial sense of mission for the future. The former saw private initiative and unrestricted markets as the principle of economic advance, and the latter favored unions and a government intervention. \u201cEconomics, properly conceived and implemented, was the route to the millennium.\u201d By 1908, the creation of the Federal Council of Churches, which encompassed most of the mainline Protestant denominations represented a coming together of both philosophies. By the time of the Great Depression, we see a uniting of religious and economic conservatism with some calling the New Deal an American name for Russian Communism and Roosevelt a dictator. Note that the people saying these things were conservative clergyman and theologians, and they enjoyed the \u201csupport of powerfully motivated and financially well-endowed members of the business community.\u201d In the early and middle decades of the nineteenth century, religious thinking had influenced American economic ideas, notes the author. The markets-based economic theorizing thus bore a positive affinity with the religious thinking that inspired it.<br /><br />Finally, today we see economics has become sufficiently mature as an intellectual discipline that the great majority of practitioners no longer shape their thinking via the force of religion persuasion. This is not true, however, of popular opinion. And the bugaboo is no longer communism, but secular humanism, which has taken the place of the former \u201cas the intellectual and cultural enemy in the nation\u2019s internal political battles.\u201d So, we see that \u201cfrom it\u2019s inception as a recognizable intellectual discipline, economics had been influenced by religious ideas.\u201d", "images": [], "asin": "B087PL2ZCB", "parent_asin": "B087PL2ZCB", "user_id": "AFK3XXDVSPJVMBSID5NPHNNUUGJA", "timestamp": 1625614249945, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Much More than a Baseball Book", "text": "Joseph Schuster's \"The Might-Have-Been\" is a terrific baseball book in the vein of \"The Natural\" or \"For Love of the Game\", but it's also a well-told 'Everyman' mid-life crisis novel on par with some of the best of the genre (for me, something like \"Straight Man\" or \"The Sportswriter\").  This novel wins on both levels and is easily one of my favorite reads of the past 12 months.<br /><br />\"The Might-Have-Been\" is the story of Edward Everett Yates--brief MLB professional and a man who's essentially committed his life to the game he loves.  The novel spans 30 plus years as Schuster details Yates' brief time in the majors and more interestingly, Yates struggles to deal with his life as it is (and the human condition in general).  Yates is depicted as a slightly better than average minor leaguer who finally gets his shot in the show only to get injured in a rain-shortened (non-official) game in which he hits for the cycle.  An earlier substitution for Lou Brock and a base on balls in his only at bat is the only blip in the MLB record books for Yates.  And as with many athletes, Yates cannot let go of his dream.  Schuster puts it best himself when he writes (about Yates): \"He realized they had seen the open door to the world outside the locker room as an invitation and not banishment; baseball was just an interesting visa stamp in the passport of their lives, while he had gotten stuck at the border, unable to cross.\"<br /><br />Yates dabbles in the family business and has some success there, but baseball's grip is too strong.  Schuster moves the story on nicely as the somewhat sympathetic Yates makes one dubious decision after another (both in job choices and relationships) seemingly doomed to spend a life in the game that's dealt him so many cruel blows.  It's a well told story, and despite Yates' poor decision making (easy to judge from outside and behind), Schuster makes him a character I could cheer for.  This is a very entertaining novel--both for the baseball fan and for the fan of great fiction.  Schuster again (via Yates): \"Be grateful for the life you have rather than regret over the one you don't.\"  This novel is a treasure and very highly recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "0345530268", "parent_asin": "0345530268", "user_id": "AHJHV5R773UVUAGDTIIHULFY2VZQ", "timestamp": 1333311911000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A STELLAR historical crime novel!", "text": "Smoke and Ashes truly deserves five stars.<br />The first star is for the most important element: an interesting story and a well-done dramatic climax.<br />The second star is for the setting, which vividly evokes India in 1921.<br />The third star is for the history I learned along the way about the independence movement Mahatma Gandhi led during this period and for the way it was woven into the story so well and so believably.  I  especially appreciated the author\u2019s note at the end to tell me what was real and what was fiction. Prince Edward really did visit India in 1921, for example, and Chitta Ranjan Das, his wife Basanti Das, and Subhash Bose, who play important roles in the book, were historical personages of great importance in Gandhi\u2019s non-violent independence struggle.<br />The fourth star is for the protagonist character, police captain Sam Wyndham. Sam is an excellent narrator for the book as he struggles with several important issues. His role as a police officer overseeing Indian society is not an easy one. Clearly he has adapted to the society and come to appreciate it in many ways, even going so far as to share rooms with his Indian partner Surendranath, known to the British as Surrender-not.  Even more difficult is Sam\u2019s addiction to opium as a result of his experiences in WWI. I give Mukherjee high marks for his handling of this aspect of the character; too often protagonists in crime novels who have a serious dysfunction become cardboard sufferers, but Sam is a well-developed believable person.<br />Finally, a fifth star for tying all these elements together with  some darned good writing, which made me often highlight passages such as this one: \u201cCalcutta was as flawed and dysfunctional as I was: a city built in the middle of a fetid Bengal swamp, populated by misfits all struggling to survive against the odds.\u201d<br />I have not read the first two books in this series, but after reading Smoke and Ashes I am not at all surprised that the first book,  A Rising Man, won the CWA Historical Dagger Award and was shortlisted for the Edgar for Best Novel.

That Evie was a brave soul! That guy that picked her up was a creepy dude. The author did an incredible job with that whole scene! She made me so fearful for her character!<br /><br />So many times the book jumps from modern day to back in the day to tell the story.

It is a brilliant set-up--1001 questions (actually, as the title says, problem solving in some cases) covering major introductory topics in chemistry. At the end of this section--actually, over half of it--comes the answers.<br /><br />Several things especially standout in the design of this book. First, the wonderful idea of building a review around a significant number of questions/problems (averaging over 60 a section) with the answers in the back of the book. (I liked the way the questions, regardless of chapters, are numbered 1-1001 and so are the answers. It makes it easy to look up.<br /><br />Each book has a different &#34;access code&#34; in the back so you can also go online to practice. The online questions are the same as the book's, but it means you can practice on various devices, at your convenience, wherever you are.<br /><br />There is a free &#34;cheat sheet&#34; that you can access at the &#34;Dummies&#34; website (an interesting website for other subjects, too). It is a list of a few helpful things to remember when solving chemistry problems. (The book also has useful tips at the beginning of every section, &#34;What to Watch Out For&#34; as well as an overview of the key concepts of each section you'll be going through).<br /><br />I liked that questions start with the easiest ones in each chapter then go to moderate and finish with the hardest. They're not just randomly arranged as with many practice books.<br /><br />I like that the answers are not just a few words, but also give explanations. You are asked to solve a significant amount of problems where you apply or explain the concepts (not just rote memorization-type questions) in each section and the answers include the equation as well as the explanation.<br /><br />Chs 1 - 5  The Basics of Chemistry (units, scientific notation, matter & energy, atoms/nuclear chemistry; the Periodic Table. There is not one included in this book, so be sure to have your own available)<br /><br />Chs  6 - 8  Chemical Bonding<br /><br />Chs  9 - 11 Chemical Reactions<br /><br />Chs 12 - 14 Acids, bases, liquids and gases<br /><br />Ch.  15  Graphing<br /><br />For example, Ch. 4, &#34;The Atom&#34; begins with questions like, &#34;How many electrons are in an atom of bromine?&#34; and &#34;An atom has a mass number of 14 and 6 electrons. How many protons and neutrons does the atom have?&#34; and ends with &#34;If a radioactive sample decays from 2.5 kg to 0.61 g and the isotope has a half-life of 9.35 hours, how much time has passed?&#34;<br /><br />I found it useful and interesting and I think beginning chemistry students or those who need to review for various kinds of tests, will get a lot of benefit from this.Definitely recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "1118549325", "parent_asin": "1118549325", "user_id": "AH6Z2YQWTP6LAMLX7VN2IXJKNVAQ", "timestamp": 1410677355000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": false}

Released 11th June 2019 by Fox Chapel on their Design Originals imprint, it's 160 pages and available in paperback format.<br /><br />Zentangle is an accessible, fun, and valuable creativity exercise which packs a lot of mindfulness and stimulation into a very short time commitment. They're also really really fun to do. These extra techniques can be used on a variety of surfaces and in a variety of sizes. For readers who are previously unfamiliar with the process, the introductory chapter in this book explains the process including a step by step visual tutorial.<br /><br />The book has an easily accessible and logical layout. The introduction (~17% of the page content) introduces basic Zentangle concepts, starting instructions, and supplies for doing the projects. The next chapter provides the reader with a thorough tutorial showing the differences between the basic Zentangle tile art and 'Dingbatz' alternatives.<br /><br />The next chapters include specific project tutorials and inspiration including stationery, a handwritten 'zine, place cards, nametags, gift tags, journals, and several more.  Each of the chapters include a self-practice workbook area.<br /><br />The final chapter includes a tangle gallery with tutorials for some of the tangle elements used in the book. There is also a brief acknowledgement section with some references for further reading (including the facebook group mention), as well as an author statement and a short index.<br /><br />This is a useful, energetic, and accessible tutorial for all things Dingbatz.  The author has a refreshingly encouraging voice and readers of all levels of expertise can use this guide to produce beautifully useful finished objects. The style of zentangle art makes them organic and structured at the same time. I really love the look of them.<br /><br />This would make a superlative gift along with some pens and tiles or a journal for a drawing friend (or oneself).<br /><br />Five stars.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "For Expert and Civil War Buff", "text": "Dr. Hess has authored one of the most significant books in print on the use of field fortifications during the US Civil War and the relationship of these works to the actual campaigns. Although there are some other books that do include some of this information, including several excellent post-war sources from the 19th century, this book does a remarkable job of putting the subject in perspective.  Many so called \"Civil War\" experts simply do not realize the significance of the role of field and permanent fortifications during many of the key campaigns of the war and reduce everything to simple terms stating \"there were breastworks, etc...\"  They simply give no detail and the reader can not understand such details as why some of these \"works\" were easily overrun, why some railroad cuts made great defensive positions and others did not, or even why on Cemetary Ridge at Gettysburg the troops of II Corps could not entrench themselves.<br /><br />Hess not only describes what the defenses consisted of, but also shows how they affected the campaign. He also includes background information as well as detailing the events related to the campaigns.  The book does not rehash the old story of bullets and beans in these operations, instead with Hess we see its bullets, beans and spades.<br /><br />  The reader will soon notice this book does not cover all the operations of the Civil War where fortifications were involved, but that is because this is the first volume with two additional ones planned.  The publisher did a good job in reproducing the photos.  One serious flaw is a lack of maps for the reader to follow everything mentioned in the text.  This usually results from the publisher attempting to save on production expenses and there is not much the author can do to correct it.  On the other hand, any expert or buff will have other books available with the missing maps they need for folowing the text (the first volume of the old West Point Atlas of American Wars has just about every map you may need).<br /><br />  This volume covers the eastern theater through April 1864 and includes a good deal of information on the defenses of Washington and Richmond (which are more than just field fortifications). It also covers the battles of the Peninsula Campaign of 1862 where fortifications played a key role.  The limited role of field fortifications in some of the campaigns of Northern Virginia are included as well as information on how work was done to protect Harrisburg and even far off Pittsburgh with fixed defenses against Lee's second invasion of the north.<br /><br />  This book is not intended for fast reading or skimming, but instead created for those who have a real interest in the Civil War and want to enjoy a good read.", "images": [], "asin": "0807829315", "parent_asin": "0807829315", "user_id": "AHYY45DWYE5TS4AIAMKWUEU3CQTA", "timestamp": 1115564506000, "helpful_vote": 22, "verified_purchase": false}

I'll read it, and I mostly like it, but it's not one my favorite genres so I don't seek it out. Short stories are iffy, as well. I'm sure it's hard to fit a complete story into such a small word count. And many authors who write short stories, should be writing novels. They just try to put too much story into a small space, and the reader ends up feeling like we've missed something important.<br /><br />Neither one of these issues was a problem when I read Unspoken Stories - Volume 1 by B.C. Young. The stories were interesting, complete, and even though they're only a few pages each, they're long enough to get you hooked and make you care about the characters.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fun and thoughtful!", "text": "When Alice Love falls and hits her head on the gym, all her memories from the past ten years disappear. She thinks she's a twenty-nine year old in love with her husband and expecting her first child. In reality, she's a soon-to-be divorced thirty-nine year old with three kids. Alice must get to know her thirty-nine year old self and try to figure out how she got to where she is in her life. Of course, everyone in her life has also changed in ten years and she has to get used to that as well.<br /><br />I loved the pacing of the story and how the author revealed information about the ten year gap in Alice's memory in bits and pieces. It was suspenseful enough that I could not put the book down but not so suspenseful that I got frustrated. It was also fascinating to read multiple characters perspective on why thirty-nine year old Alice is the way she is. The back cover of my copy says, \"Finally, a smart woman's beach read.\" I think that's a great assessment. Alice is charming, likable and really funny at times like a good chick-lit heroine but this was not a fluffy story - it had some real meat to it.<br /><br />This book had me thinking about for days after I finished it. What would my self of ten years ago think of my self now - not knowing any of the things that have happened to me over the past ten years? I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun AND thoughtful summer read.<br /><br />*** As an aside - there is an infertility subplot that was handled really well. As someone who experienced three years of infertility before my first child was born, I'm extra sensitive to that sort of thing.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "there she blows!", "text": "In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick retells the true story of how a sperm whale rammed a whaleship in the early 1800\u2019s and caused one of the most shocking disaster of that time. Unbeknownst to me, the popular story of Moby Dick, which I\u2019m sure many of us have read or heard about during our early school years, was actually based on this story here. I blasted through this book over the weekend because it was just that good! You may not think there\u2019s much to tell of a shipwreck but you\u2019d be dead wrong. The survivors of the Essex whaleship disaster and what they had to endure is nothing short of pure torture of the highest degree and to even fathom how some of them made it out alive is a pure miracle of the highest order. The story has also been made into a movie of the same name starring Chris Hemsworth.<br /><br />\u201cFirst I cry for his departure, then laugh because I\u2019m free.\u201d \u2013 Eliza Brock, Nantucket resident<br /><br />Rather than dive straight into the disaster itself, the author gave a pretty detailed account of Nantucket, the island most famous during its time as the capital of whale oil harvesting from sperm whales. It\u2019s obvious that killing and harvesting an animal for its product can be cruel. However, you should put all bias and opinions aside when reading stories such as this. We must never forget that these events took place almost two centuries ago. Things were a lot different then. The author retells this amazing story through the book and journal accounts of two survivors, first mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson. I found it amazing and oddly eerie that despite the dangers and circumstances they had to go through, the words they choose at certain times to describe the scene and emotions they were going through very poetic and calming.<br /><br />Hunting sperm whales for their oil was literally backbreaking work. Regardless of how one feels about the trade, you can\u2019t deny that it takes a certain amount of courage. The hunters never had any high tech machinery to kill the whales. They relied on hand weapons such as harpoons and lances and that means the need to get up close and personal to the whale in the open sea in your little wooden boat. In addition, when a single voyage means almost being 2-3 years away from your family and friends, one must be physically and mentally fit to go through with it time and time again. In regards to the actual disaster itself and what the men had to go through to survive, you\u2019ll just have to read it to believe it. It\u2019s as simple as that.<br /><br />\u201cWe have been stove by a whale.\u201d \u2013 Owen Chase<br /><br />In the Heart of the Sea makes me appreciate non-fiction books that much more. When they are well written and told, it can beat any fantasy novel. I literally couldn\u2019t put this book down because I just had to find out what happened next. Again, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that just because the men were stranded in the middle of the ocean that \u201cnothing\u201d of importance happens until they were rescued. If you have a goal of reading just one non-fiction book for the year, definitely make it this one. But like the author mentions at the end, just don\u2019t label this an adventure story. It\u2019s a disaster that just happens to be one of the greatest true stories ever told.", "images": [], "asin": "0141001828", "parent_asin": "0141001828", "user_id": "AG4E55UFZJEUMD5DKLC6QVDDDN5Q", "timestamp": 1608019326627, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A little of the good, the bad and the ugly", "text": "In some ways it is 5-star, in others it is 1-star -- thus the 3 stars. I cannot lie. I found this book difficult to read due to the author's style and odd grammar, but I do find it to be a worthwhile book because it says things that NEED to be said and are not said enough.<br /><br />SOME PROS: This book -- as maddening as it was to read -- caused me to look at my own very different life experience in relation to Jesus in a new way that causes me to think it was not so different from Ms. Tower's after all. I also liked the way she put a good emphasis on treating one another with love and how important that is. This book gave me a whole new appreciation for pastors. I never really realized just how much one person in their church could put them through (sorry Ally, but you leaned on them a LOT...!!!). At the same time, I hope that pastors are the main people who read this book -- because it might help them realize how shunning is truly ineffective. I don't blame the pastors for Ally's problems, but she did trust those pastors like they were family and it was not until they learned to treat her with more acceptance and love that they could all really work to pray together in a way that was good for everyone involved. Her story highlights how easily the clergy can be their own worst enemy when they fear a person having problems rather than trusting God.<br /><br />SOME CONS: Poor editing of this book made it sometimes difficult for me to read. It would have been good for the editor to sit with the author and have her clarify the many sentences she wrote that truly made no sense without having to \"figure it out\" before continuing. I found this to be exasperating at times, but I really wanted to hear her story and plowed through. I often felt she was taking me in never-ending circles as she kept reverting back to where she started over and over. That is, she would reach out to the church, but then get involved more with Wicca. I think what bothered me the most was that although she elaborated (probably too much) on her conversations with different pastors and deacons and their wives regarding her spiritual struggle, she made not one allusion that I can remember to having told the Wiccans she was going to church. I wanted to know more about them and she seemed to protect them from exposure while elucidating about details of the rituals perhaps to prove that it was not \"satanic.\"<br /><br />BUT I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HER -- ANOTHER PRO: My mind kept judging her as I read the book, \"How can she do that? Why is she so wishy-washy?\" when she would reach out to the pastors of her church, have an awakening and feel touched by the Lord Jesus, and then go back into doing a full-out Wiccan ritual. I as stunned as I realized how like her I have been in my own life, (only without a relationship with the church and pastors), and how I strayed from true Christianity for 30 years -- following a guru while also calling myself a Christian and blithely thinking and feeling there was nothing at all wrong with that...!!!  Wow wow wow. I was just like her -- only in a different setting!<br /><br />MORE CONS: It bothers me -- a LOT -- that she quoted so very few Bible passages in this book. People should be told that the Lord makes it clear that sorcery and witchcraft are an abomination in His eyes. I also wonder why in the world the pastors did not quote that passage to her (or if they did, why she chose not to mention it). Which leads me to another important point: the very few Bible quotes she gave were not from the real Bible but from paraphrasing \"bibles.\" I realize that most Christians have NO CLUE that the 200-some \"new translations\" of the Bible are NOT the same Bible that Christians have given their lives to preserve for so many centuries. (Please check out YouTube videos with Gail Riplinger, David W. Daniels and others for more information if you don't want to buy their books on the topic. We are talking about the Word of God here. It is IMPORTANT...!!!!)<br /><br />Last but not least, the author makes it TOTALLY clear that she was never a satanist and rarely thought she was doing anything \"bad\" in Wicca. She spends way too much time defending herself and defending Wicca and for me the cliffhanger of the book was to find out whether she would EVER see and admit that Wicca ultimately IS a tool of the devil. (And the answer is, well, yes and no. She kinda sorta admits it without making it too plain -- apparently because she feels it is too offensive to think of it that way?)<br /><br />It was an exhausting book to read, but I am glad I read it. Actually, I have 10 pages to go before completely finishing the book but have already speed-read through to the end. Some books you wish would never end; this book is one I am very glad ended. I wish the author well and I am glad she is sharing her story -- yet I also feels she would or will be able to write a MUCH superior book once she gets her life and head straightened out a while longer (and starts also learning to read the REAL Bible...!)<br /><br />Last but not least, the author does not seem to understand (or admit) that there really ARE a lot of different types of witches -- and probably also a lot of different types of Wiccans. I found her defense of Wicca to be incessant even though she finally let go of it in the end. I can understand now the reviewer who said s/he got the impression that the author may not have really let go all the way yet.<br /><br />I might question the veracity of the author were it not for the fact she has come out with a second book, FROM THE CRAFT TO CHRIST. I purchased both of them at the same time, and have a feeling I am going to enjoy it very much as it includes the stories of eight other former witches who have come to -- or come back to -- serving our Lord Jesus Christ.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Well Written Fictional Portrayal of Early 20th Century Kidnapping", "text": "Andrew Hilleman's &#34;World, Chase Me Down&#34; is an extremely well-written novel, based on the real-life kidnapping of the 16-year old son of a wealthy Omaha meat-packing magnate in 1900 by Pat Crowe and his criminal partner Billy Cavenaugh.  It's told from Crowe's perspective and largely in the form of flashbacks to the period surrounding the crime and the trial five years later, as well as a few glimpses into Crowe's later days (circa 70 years old).  Hilleman is an evocative writer and does an excellent job portraying early 20th century Omaha, Nebraska and Crowe's life on the lam.<br /><br />Pat Crowe--aside from one or two incidents--is a fairly likable criminal and it's the flashbacks to 1900 that are the highlights of this novel.  The trial bogs down a bit and is less entertaining than the rest of the book, but overall, this is an enjoyable and entertaining read, and an interesting fictionalized portrait of an early 20th Century crime and Omaha.", "images": [], "asin": "0143111477", "parent_asin": "0143111477", "user_id": "AHJHV5R773UVUAGDTIIHULFY2VZQ", "timestamp": 1484601115000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Margo Guide to Budget Hotels in France", "text": "\"European hotels do not have facecloths. I always pack mine. Showers: I haven't figured out why some showers don't have shower curtains on them.\" ~Margo<br /><br />On my last trip to France, this book would have come in handy. One of the hotels I stayed at in Paris did not even have shower curtains and when I sat on the bed, the bed literally collapsed. This was in a very nice hotel and I was shocked. While the tour guide seemed oblivious to the predicament, I never forgot the experience. The breakfast the next morning and tour was of course worth the effort of having to put the bed back together.<br /><br />A guide by Margo would have helped me select my own hotel accommodations that weekend. I also found I wanted to spend more time in various locations and a tour to Paris seemed rushed on a weekend. I wanted to spend an entire week, no a month just wandering around France. When we traveled to Provence, I had no idea where to stay and while we found nice hotels, it was purely by chance and we had no idea what to expect. When at the Louvre I wandered around not realizing I could get a portable headset to explain some of the paintings.<br /><br />Throughout this guide to Budget Hotels in France, Margo selects the best hotels and explains why a double bed is cheaper than twin beds and why you might be able to ask for a \"zip and lock\" king-size bed (they might put two beds together), but why king-size beds are not something you will find in Budget hotels.<br /><br />If you love to cook, you might want to look for the Culinary School listing. There are detailed descriptions of all the hotels, including unique creative touches like she mentions the way the rooms are decorated. Will you have to climb stairs, do you want a garden/patio, does the room have a view of the Eiffel Tower?<br /><br />Margo spent ten weeks traveling around France and went to 30 of the most popular cities to explore the hotels she has written about. She spent her own money and time to produce this book and no hotel or restaurant has paid to be in this book. If where you stay is as important as the sites you will visit, then this is the book for you. A list of French Phrases for checking in is included. If you want to spend more money eating out and touring the cities, then this guide will also help you save money.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "images": [], "asin": "0965394476", "parent_asin": "0965394476", "user_id": "AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA", "timestamp": 1137988638000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

It's characterized by the creation of paradigms which exist when someone comes up with a great way of explaining something. When flaws appear in that first discoverer's fascade, the collective impulse on the part of the scientific community is to either ignore or minimalize the importance of the new evidence until enough scientists die off that the new generation can really appreciate the power of the new ideas in their own right.

Now Bria, Finn, and Owen have been drugged and kidnapped and Gin has just barely escaped with the help of an unexpected ally. She will need friends and allies if she wants to save them and live to fight another day.<br /><br />A fun, quick read.  The basic plot was pretty standard for the series and not much headway was made on the overarching Circle plot but there was a bit of expose of Gin's mother's past and much less of her usual repetitive drivel so that made for an overall better reading experience.", "images": [], "asin": "1501142216", "parent_asin": "1501142216", "user_id": "AHHH4ADO6NO6TKUPYDCJUDAOGIFA", "timestamp": 1491373651000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good book worth reading because you will gain some insight here.  I just felt it became a bit repetitive at times.  Maybe he was being repetitive to reinforce the fact that attaining mastery requires repetition?<br /><br />I love the layout of the book because it is small chapters on a topic with dozens of notes and stories in the borders of the page.  It works out great for me because I would read a page or two, put it down and come back to it later, which gave me time to let each idea or thought sink in and gave me time to analyze them thoroughly.  I normally go through a book in a day or two, this one took me almost 3 months to read fully. But I think I got a lot more out of it that way.<br /><br />The author breaks up mastery into a few stages, apprenticeship, a creative-active level, and then mastery.  He further breaks down each level in strategies and modes.  Mastery will not come easily, it takes self discipline and perseverance, but it is achievable.  He also talks about something more important, making sure you are trying to gain mastery in the correct area or field.  Life could suck if you gain mastery and then realize it is something you hate to do.  Pick the right area.<br /><br />This book can help at many levels.  There is mastery of a career or maybe just mastery of a hobby or sport.  I used a number of the things I have learned in this book and others and applied it to a hobby of mine, competitive shooting.  I shot for many years achieving a level of just being average.  Then I found an acquaintance at a party who talked about competitive shooting.  He invited me to go shoot with him one day.  I realized that while I was learning at my own trial and error pace it could take me decades to get to his level on my own, or I could see this person as a mentor and knock years off my learning curve.  Since I started training with my friend I have already won two matches in my classification.  I have improved on every level imaginable in this sport and the more I learn, the more I realize there is to learn.  But getting back to the book, I am focusing on some thoughts the author laid out about mastering the basics through effort and practice before trying to move up a level with incomplete or inferior skills.  While I have yet to gain what I consider mastery in this sport, I know for a fact that I am well on my way and will achieve it quicker than if I did not follow the guidance of this book.", "images": [], "asin": "0670024961", "parent_asin": "0670024961", "user_id": "AGJ7II4THZHHSRGJ62ZWUDVDJQGQ", "timestamp": 1393249395000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

It was super sad to read the last in the series.<br /><br />But, as usual, Heather Brewer doesn't disappoint her minions!<br /><br />In The Slayer Chronicles, she tells the story from Joss McMillian & the Slayers' point of view.<br /><br />It doesn't just work--it ROCKS!<br /><br />So many times while reading First Kill I was like, \"Oh, oh, I know...this is xyz from Vlad! Awesome!\" And it was awesome! And the coolest thing is that you could start with Vlad or Joss and be equally as hooked! Have I mentioned how freaking cool this is? I mean, really, it is total author genius here! For real life!<br /><br />OK, but what's the big deal? Well, Joss is a regular kid who is about to go hang out with his awesome cousin for the summer. Then his sister gets killed. In the middle of the night. By a vampire! At the funeral, his creepy uncle tells him to swear that he'll avenge her death. He swears. Fast forward a few years and we learn that, understandably, Joss and his parents have never recovered from the loss. Joss is ignored by his parents, who have just been coasting on auto-pilot since his sister's murder. So when that creepy Uncle Abraham asks for Joss to spend the summer with him doing wilderness survival training, the whole McMillan family goes for it. It is in the mountains that he learns the truth behind the Slayer Society and begins his crazy & often cruel training. Through Joss, we learn the flip side. Not as  much vampires are so awesome, but more of a awww, poor Slayers kind of sympathy. But the way that Joss looks at the world with compassion, empathy, and hatred totally works. Come on, how many people can pull that off?<br /><br />Bottom line: If you loved Vlad, you'll love First Kill. If you haven't met Vlad yet, then you can start with either series (but if you are impatient like me, go for Vlad first because that series has more books!).[[ASIN:0803737416 First Kill (The Slayer Chronicles)]]", "images": [], "asin": "0803737416", "parent_asin": "0803737416", "user_id": "AHHEXI3ZI46GMBXWFWA64MYD4RIQ", "timestamp": 1327964551000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

As a consultant to medium and small companies, it is frustrating for me to explain to a mid-sized company manager why those MBA case studies don\u2019t apply and won\u2019t work for them.

Meeting deadlines, tinkering, \u201cshoot from the hip\u201d strategies, acquisitions, operations, cash management, and dysfunctional leaders. Many of the case studies reveal the importance of common sense which isn\u2019t too common at all. Like: let your cash flow finance your growth, don\u2019t leverage the entire company on a single strategy when you\u2019ve got a solid performer that is profitable, don\u2019t do M&A if your staff doesn\u2019t know M&A, recruit right.

I love how in Chapter 3 she talked about partnering with others and how it is okay to reach out to others when you need help this hit a chord with me because I struggle with reaching out to others when I need help because I just don't want to bother people with my troubles, and I try to do things myself. I learned through that section on partnership that it is okay to reach out to others because they will spur you on in your journey with the Lord.<br /><br />In Chapter 5 she talks about anger in depth which I have struggled with my anger a lot and I really never understood because there are some people that I have anger against the exercise in the book she had was to write in a journal or a piece of paper of the following prompts such as &#34;I'm sad about.., I'm scared about..., I'm mad about... then you were to write about whatever comes to mind and then if you couldn't come up with anything then she said spend five more minutes reflecting on that statement. Finally, she said to leave your feelings right where they are which was a great exercise because it showed me the things that I was angry about.<br /><br />Finally, I loved Chapter 8 because it talked about us women knowing our limits and learning how to say no things that we are not able to commit to which I have struggled with boundaries because at times I want to do it all.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Madame Budska or Maud Strand?", "text": "Wow.  Sometimes one finds a diamond in the rough.  Having been asked to review this book I bought it for my kindle as I was drawn to the description which said it &#34;dabbles in provocative subjects such as psychic phenomena, economics, morality, masochism, color, jazz, history, and a bit of romance with an NYPD detective&#34;  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />First, let me talk about the negative aspect of the book.  The author would have made this even better with just a bit more editing and maybe one more pass with a copy editor.  Each scene change has a heading which in the beginning was distracting but I will say as the story developed this was not as bothersome.<br /><br />The story itself is gripping and I found it hard to put down.  The writer draws you in quickly and at times I forgot I was reading a work of fiction.  If you have ever seen a film with a famous actor who makes you forget that you are watching them act, then you know what I mean.  The transition from past to present was easy to follow and never &#34;pulled&#34; me out of the story.<br /><br />The character, Maud Strand, is one I would like to read more about.  She seemed to me, to be more interesting than Madame Budska.  Based on the title the author seems to disagree, hopefully she will change her mind.<br /><br />The ending was slightly rushed and left me wondering about what was going to happen to Maud.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Against All Odds", "text": "Holy s***. I haven't had a book depress me, disgust me, inspire me, and compel me this much in a long time. It's a book filled with injustice and I applaud Damien Echols for making it through this insane and maddening ordeal.<br /><br />I had followed the West Memphis Three case extensively when I was in high school. For those of you who aren't familiar with the case, in 1993 three teenage boys in Arkansas were wrongly convicted of satanically murdering three little boys. It was a very modern day Salem witch trial and Jason and Jessie were given life imprisonment and Damien was given the death sentence simply for being the town \"outcasts.\" I watched the 3 HBO \"Paradise Lost\" documentaries and read \"The Devil's Knot,\" but nothing touched me more than Echols memoir of the incident and his experiences in prison.<br /><br />After Damien was found guilty he spent EIGHTEEN years on death row and his life was utter hell. In this book he describes the fellow prisoners, daily rituals, and how hard it is to keep sane when you're in solitary confinement. It is a true triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />This memoir is written quite eloquently and goes back and forth between memories of his childhood, coping with the WM3 case, his life in prison, and his life as a free man (he was released mid 2011). The prose sticks with you and you find yourself going on an emotional rollercoaster ride with Damien as he recounts some of the worst points of his life.<br /><br />This is seriously a must read. Despite all the odds, Damien came through a horrific ordeal that kept him imprisoned for half of his life. Injustice like this cannot be forgotten. Read his story and be inspired (also be sure to check out the Sundance documentary \"West of Memphis\" produced by Peter Jackson, it's coming out on DVD soon).

I first became acquainted with his vast expertise at a random family history conference I decided to attend one Satruday in Salt Lake City, UT.  The one hour I spent listening to Barry's instruction on how to collect/record oral interviews was one of the most worthwhile hours I ever spent.  Therefore, I was very motivated to learn anything else I could from him.  I have anxiously awaited the publishing of this book, and have followed Barry on Facebook as well. I started towards the end of the book (chapter 11) because lately I have been engaged in collecting, transcribing, and disseminating written family history articles (letters, journals, and other documents), and I was not disappointed. Barry systematically lays an outline and provides interesting and applicable methods for accomplishing suggested family history tasks.  His work is thorough - and therefore thought-provoking and inspiring.  I have been doing family history work for 15 years and am very organized; Therefore, I was reassured that much of what I have done is in fact very efficient.  But, Barry's insight and experiences and suggestions on how to approach other family members to obtain information was specifically invaluable for me....because it is an area I have failed in time and time again and really didn't know how to proceed.  I now feel like I have a whole \"tool kit\" to approach this aspect of family history work, and look forward to giving it another try.

Dan Pearl succeeded notably in that enterprise, writing with professional detachment, objectivity, elegance, humor, and a tincture of scholarship about the ironies of the human condition in far-flung, exotic places - India, where cows may be sacred but leather goods are manufactured; Iran, whose youths may publicly spout anti-American slogans but scheme to obtain in, say, Turkey, a U.S. visa \"to study, perchance to stay\" - an allusion to Hamlet's \"to sleep, perchance to dream\"; even Kosovo, where \"genocide\" turned out to be \"small acts of intimate barbarity.\" Throughout his educative articles, which he honed until he heard the sentences \"sing,\" Dan Pearl exhibits the total lack of malice, the calm and perceptive gaze, and the disinclination to histrionics for which his father justly praises him in a prefatory eulogy.

London is a city of clockwork automatons, steam powered vehicles, airships, and strange human-machine hybrids.  Not to mention revenents infected with an exotic disease.<br /><br />Queen Victoria is being kept alive by a mixture of science, chemicals and machines.  Sir Maurice Newbury serves the Queen as a secret investigative agent.  Newbury has some personal issues.  Amongst these is an addiction to opiates.  He is given the assignment of bringing in a rogue agent who died five years ago, but is still somehow alive.  The clues he follows include an Egyptian mummy, missing women, the occult, and a mad scientist.<br /><br />Newbury works with his trusted assistant, Veronica Hobbs.  She too has secrets.  Unknown to Newbury, she is also an agent of the Queen.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Solid Primer on How Businesses Can Make the Most of Facebook", "text": "According to the Nielsen Media Research study released in December 2011, Facebook is the second most accessed website in the US. Nearly half the country has Facebook accounts with around 875 million users, which would make Facebook the world's third most populous country if it was a political sovereignty. On May 17, 2012, Facebook, Inc. held an initial public offering negotiating a share price of $38 valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company. Despite the shakiness of the stock value in the weeks since, there is no getting around the fact that entrepreneurs and enterprises recognize a need for a Facebook presence to partake in a piece of the burgeoning social commerce pie. Social media mavens Brian Carter and Justin Levy provide an effective primer that helps the relative online neophyte get started on Facebook with the intent of optimizing it for business and branding.<br /><br />The book effectively breaks down a lot of features which may not be readily apparent from a personal user standpoint such as how exactly Facebook's News Feed works. Blending top stories and recent entries, the feed is determined through an internal algorithm called EdgeRank and is calculated by the unique mix of friends and pages with which you interact the most. Consequently, you will see more of the types of posts (statuses, photos, videos and questions) you interact with, and in turn, less of those you don't. The co-authors discuss changes in Facebook's privacy policy, how these could affect your business and what you need to know about the limits of online privacy. Moreover, they teach you how to design custom landing tabs, event platforms and measure your Facebook performance. In turn, the co-authors go on to describe how to make the most of advertising campaigns on Facebook and the role of community building around corporate causes, commercial or otherwise.<br /><br />The section on analytics is probably the most critical part of the book because Carter and Levy give clear guidance on how to access data about users and their interactions on a business's pages and how to use Google Analytics and other third-party tools to gain deeper knowledge about their user base. Easily the most entertaining section focuses on the successful use cases for Facebook and how the best pages leverage existing websites by means of the Like button, as well as the chat and comments features. It details how Facebook Credits works and explains why virtual currency is an essential monetization effort by Facebook.  I especially enjoyed the \"Best in Class Facebook Pages\" whose subjects range from Barack Obama to Brian Solis to Volkswagen. Even though the edition I read was published this year, it didn't go into the replacement of the Profile with the Timeline and the controversy that decision engendered. Regardless, it's a solid how-to book for those just beginning to consider Facebook as a viable channel for business development.", "images": [], "asin": "078974113X", "parent_asin": "078974113X", "user_id": "AEBZFMNIRS5U4DQN2BVEYZFKRXEA", "timestamp": 1338961121000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "\"I was born beautiful\"", "text": "The Gist:<br />Darcy Rhone thought she was living a charmed life.  She had a fabulous job (in PR, of course), a fabulous fiance (gorgeous, ivy-league lawyer), and more designer clothes than Paris Hilton.  In fact, she was fabulous from the top of her perfectly coifed head to the tips of her Jimmy Choos.  Could life be any more charming or fabulous?<br /><br />Then, one day shortly before her wedding, she visits her best friend only to find her fiance hiding in a closet..sans pants.<br /><br />To make matters worse, she discovers her fling with her fiance's friend has resulted in a pregnancy!<br /><br />What's a fabulous girl to do?  Dump her fiance, quit her job, pack her Louis Vuitton and head to London to start a new, even-more-fabulous life.<br /><br />Something Blue is a light, easy read. As fun as any other novel in the chic lit genre.  Though, I did like Ms. Giffin's Baby Proof better.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Emily Giffin is a talented writer.  She is deft at creating characters and crafting interesting, believable, engaging dialogue.  Her plots are simple enough, and yet, keep the reader involved until the very last word.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Darcy Rhone, the heroine, had absolutely no redeeming qualities through the first half of the book.  She was crass, crude, self-absorbed, selfish, cruel, snotty, and insufferably ignorant.  In case my laundry list of her horrible traits didn't give it away, you need to know that I hated her.  Hated her.  I laothed her from her very first utterance: \"I was born beautiful.\"  Because I felt so strongly about Darcy Rhone, so negatively, I found her transformation difficult to believe.  After a hundred plus pages of her cheating on her fiance, screaming like a lunatic, spouting profanities like the Trevi Fountain spouts water, I just found it hard to believe she would magically transform into a maternal, thoughtful person.  One friend tells her that she is selfish and she suddenly decides to turn over a new leaf, to start acting like a considerate, kind human being?  I didn't buy it.<br /><br />And, the just plain UGLY:<br />The first few chapters of Something Blue are filled with self-absorbed, immoral characters who seem to spend inordinate amounts of time having casual sex, imbibing copious quantities of alcohol, and acting in ways that make it painfully difficult for any reader to uncover a single redeeming quality about them.  Though I have no problem reading books or watching tv shows about free, independent, liberated women (am, in fact, a rabid Sex and the City fan even all these years later), I was put off by Darcy's frequent profane, childish, and inane oubursts.  I could almost hear her screeching (which is a credit to Ms. Giffin's ability to sketch a character).<br /><br />The bottom line:<br />Emily Giffin's outstanding writing and well-paced plot make this book a great beach read.  Readers who have delicate ears and sensibilities might take offense at Darcy's promiscuity and profanity.  However, readers who like the fun and escape offered by books of the chic lit genre will appreciate Something Blue!", "images": [], "asin": "B0018SWA56", "parent_asin": "B0018SWA56", "user_id": "AE7AQ2KNKFVJHUEE3SQUFVVNUCZQ", "timestamp": 1213765088000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Family fun", "text": "This is a very colorful book splattered with Emeril's image throughout in various stages of posed animation. This book is intended for children to use with their parents or if you are so inclined to read  yourself about food preperation . The fact that the information is global is very appealing. Emeril begins with some basic lessons concerning safety , nuts and bolts and other good things to know before you actually attempt cooking a meal.The first destination is Breakfast with recipes from Spain, Mexico, England, Switzerland and other countries. The choice of dishes are savory yet pretty simple for beginner cooks and usually limited to under ten steps. There is a small cultural lesson and flag representing the country of origin to go with the dish as well as a did you know section for each recipe. Next is Sightseeing Snacks, Salads and Starters with adventures into new countries like vietnam, Italy , Greece, Japan and others not used in breakfast.Onward to Globe-Trotting Soups and Sandwiches, continuing with Main Meal Masterpieces where the dishes are a little more challenging but doable with additional information on A Guide to Sides, the Bread Map and Sweet Snapshots. At over 200 pages with large print this book  is good for the novice cook or student who wants to help prepare a meal with adult supervision. The oversized drawings and comical nature of Emeril's photographs make for what is intended to be a fun time in the kitchen. This is definitely a companion book where the adult and child must use the book together otherwise the child may have a problem in the kitchen. The meals are all pretty nutritious but have no caloric information. I think it is pretty cool for Emeril to take his personality and lend it to an educational endeavor where he combines his culinary talents with learning about other cultures. This would make a good school library book or one for a parent to share with their child. The reading level is fairly simple. This book will appeal to young readers with culinary ambitions ages 10-18.", "images": [], "asin": "0060739266", "parent_asin": "0060739266", "user_id": "AFIA5YDIOGEGNRECRIKC2U72H3SQ", "timestamp": 1167767016000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Read", "text": "**I received an ARC of this story in exchange for an honest review**<br />Michelle is stuck in Temptation, LA, trying to get her grandmother to leave with her as a hurricane is approaching. When she finally gives up, Sheriff Gator Landry shows up in his boat with another attempt at evacuation. Instead, they are all trapped in the house when the hurricane hits. This give both Gator and Michelle time to recall all the feelings they shared 16yrs earlier when Michelle spent a summer with her grandparents. As Michelle stays around for cleanup afterwards, they start to experience the same feelings as before.<br />Michelle, not given the best example of a family, has done well at succeeding at a job she's always wanted and living a life she's happy with. She definitely cares for her grandma and is willing to do what she can for her. Gator is a fairly typical male. He was given a huge responsibility he didn't want, but in the end, he decided to step up to the plate. Having been hurt years before by Michelle, he was afraid to get close to her again.<br />Overall, I really liked this book.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not for everyone...", "text": "I first want to say that I read this book from beginning to end. I often lose interest in books, even the good ones, so for it to keep my attention was feat in itself. However, I am ambivalent about this book. It kept me reading, mainly due to the technical craft of the writer, more so than to the building of plot or an investment in any of the characters. The main character seemed to show little growth or development as he aged and although I should have had more empathy for him, it was lacking. Theo's narrative style changes little from an adolescent into adulthood, considering the story is supposedly told from the notebooks he kept throughout his life. Due to the character's lack of maturity, by the end I had little compassion for his fate. Was this the writer's intention? Some implausible plot points also added to a lack of my full investment in discovering where things were headed. I've intentionally avoided spoilers, but the one thing I must say is that if you are waiting for things to wrap up nicely, or with any sense of optimism, you will be left unfulfilled. Oddly enough, the final chapter was probably my favorite part of the novel. It was so well written and the philosophical points resonated. Thankfully, it was a deserved little treasure presented at the end of a somewhat arduous 771 page journey.", "images": [], "asin": "0316055441", "parent_asin": "0316055441", "user_id": "AGS5FN3TBKYF47NHS3NTLAU5VCBQ", "timestamp": 1548438310328, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "When in Rome, do as the Romans do...", "text": "\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" is the mantra followed by Glen Husak and her husband, Al, as they embark on an annual Passeggiata, an Italian journey that continues less for the sake of a goal than for the movement itself.  In her travel memoir, named for this journey of movement, Glen recounts the highlights and pitfalls of their visits to Italy since 1993.  They began their travels as amateurs frequently getting lost and trusting in merchants to charge the correct amount of lire, but have emerged as seasoned Italiaphiles equally at home in Houston and Rome.<br /><br />Visiting northern and southern Italy in March, Glen and Al have avoided crowds, however this comes at the expense of many tourist amenities not yet being open for the season.  The Husak's have found the upside to this scenario and actually relish the discovery of un-touristy spots in the hill towns, Rome, Naples and beyond.  From churches and monasteries to restaurants and hotels, taking the less traveled path has worked well for this couple.<br /><br />Functioning as a travel memoir, Glen shares much of their adventures with the reader. Anticipating my own trip to Italy, I appreciate the insight into Italian travel however I couldn't help but be disappointed when reading the description of a lovely caf\u00e9 or hotel without ever being given the name of it.  I would have loved to support these families on my own trip!  Glen's love for Italy jumps off the page at the reader as she goes on in quite lengthy descriptions of things. At this point, her teaching profession becomes apparent to the reader as you feel her being redundant in overemphasizing a lesson or memory that was easily understood and appreciated the first time.  One frustration with this book was the lack of preparedness exhibited by Glen and Al when sight seeing.  How many times did they need to leave their camera in the hotel room and then encounter a photograph worthy moment before learning to always have it with them when traveling through such beautiful country?!<br /><br />Overall, the reader, whether having been to Italy or planning a trip there, will enjoy the Husak's perspective on a culture so different from the United States.  Hopefully those that follow a path to Italy will learn \"la dolce far niente\" or the sweetness of doing nothing as experienced by the Husak's.<br /><br />Author's Website: [...]", "images": [], "asin": "141968289X", "parent_asin": "141968289X", "user_id": "AGP7XCQRYXAYRFHJW4I33BCPL6UQ", "timestamp": 1234367111000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Instead, Claude\u2019s dad is in charge\u2014and she\u2019s sure he\u2019s running things into the ground. She wants to step in, but her parents are keeping secrets and her partner in crime, Fingerless Brett, is suddenly on the straight and narrow.<br />Then, when a very strange character by the name of Alma Lingonberry shows up in the neighborhood, Claude gets closer to the crime life than ever.

Author Gerald Luc gushes about this 100 page short as \"having a soundtrack\" because he often mentions particular songs in conjunction with particular scenes.  He also had the audacity to add (supposedly truthful) \"descriptions\" of counter-culture cliques such as hippies, punks, and beatniks; an insult to those of us who actually were alive during these cultural revolutions and took place in them.<br /><br />The drugs?  No one shoots up, a couple of pills are popped, and a little MJ smoking is achieved.  There are no trips and one very lame withdrawal described more like a tequila hangover.  If it's true that you should \"write what you know\", this kid strayed far from that advice.  It's true the prose shows some promising future skill at writing, but the author needs to work on the emotional aspect of his flat and careless characterizations.<br /><br />So what is the book about?  A young man wants to write a book, has a great deal of carnal relationships with several girls, spends a weekend in New York where another teenage carnal fantasy is filled by having a hooker show up at his hotel room.  There isn't much to the book except bland rutting and pipe dreams of youth.  Boring.

It is a painfully realistic dissection of the internal dynamics and tensions of pretty ordinary family life, and the sort of value shifts that occurred in the latter half of the 20th century (at least in western, Americanised cultures, such as mine).<br />What I particularly liked was the shifting viewpoints; Franzen has managed to get into the subconscious, perhaps the soul of family relationships, and help us to understand the motivations, foibles and passions of very ordinary people - people who we can recognise, parts of whom it is not too difficult to imagine being able to see in ourselves.<br />I am especially interested in the relationship of adult children to their elderly parents (probably reflecting the stage of life I am at) and I think Franzen has written about this with poignancy, but without maudlin or schmaltzy excess, which may have been the result in a lesser writer's hands.<br />It is thoroughly contemporary, and at the same time explores some universal themes. The social mores and conventions may change over generations, but the need to examine them and hold them up to the light do not diminish. What Jane Austen achieved with 19th century social relationships in a certain cultural setting, so does Franzen.<br />It is also very funny in parts.<br />I recommend it without hesitation.", "images": [], "asin": "0312421273", "parent_asin": "0312421273", "user_id": "AESFQEPQRIXE4VJD2DR3QWZJHJCQ", "timestamp": 1031809684000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "2.5 stars from me: I learned from it, but I was also irritated by it and the tone", "text": "The book did motivate me to learn more and reduce waste. However, I think the author is not part of an everyday family with average means and access, and I suspect she doesn't work a typical job in terms of core working hours and flexibility. Yet I think she wrote her book for typical families -- those with average monetary and schedule considerations. I was irked the tone of the book and what I perceived to be the sense that many scenarios families face are clear-cut, black and white choices between right and wrong, good and evil.<br /><br />Much of what she recommends requires you to have lots of spare time and resources. And most of us do not have access to much of what she recommends using/buying. I do realize that if you and your family dive 100% into this process the way she was able to, you will save money, and, therefore, might gather the means to be more flexible and be able to afford this lifestyle. But if you and your family cannot dive in 100%, this process will cost much more in terms of time, energy, resources, and money. I think her family supported her ambition without exception, and that makes the transition to and sustainment of this lifestyle much easier. In reality, though, I suspect that most families will support small aspects--but not most or all--of this lifestyle, so I think many families will wind up leading both lifestyles partway, which is maybe okay to do, but it will take more time, energy, and money to do it. She needs to address that and help the partway families or the families with reluctant members. A more modular approach in the book might have helped a wider cross section of families.<br /><br />She also seems to live in a binary world where a thing is either useful or useless, and it is that one thing to every member of the family unequivocally. What I find to be use/ful/less is subjective, and I'm not the only person living in my household. So her advice about things like decorating is useless and often irritating. Lastly, I can't relate to lots of the recommendations, such as using turkey lacers for toothpicks and getting laser surgery instead of using reading glasses.<br /><br />If the book had approached the transition more incrementally, if it had been framed differently, and if it addressed the typical family in our society, I think I'd recommend it. As is, I think you can learn more from the internet and by reading various facebook groups that support reduction and reuse. I got the book in paper format because I wanted to read it, learn from it, and then share it without the restrictions that kindle-sharing imposes.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved this book. Teriffic writing. My highest recommendation.", "text": "I LOVED this book! Cannot emphasize this enough. Never judge a book by its cover, because the cover here is so bland and boring that I don't know what the publisher was thinking. But the story inside!<br /><br />Anthony Varallo's THE LINES is the story of one family's slow disintegration in the aftermath of a separation. It is an EVERYMAN kind of story, and I think Varallo made a conscious decision to make it that. Because the principal characters have no names. They are, simply, the mother, the father, the girl and the boy. The parents, early to mid-thirties, the girl is ten, the boy seven. The girl seems older, the boy seems even younger than his age. Both are devastated, in their own ways, by the parents' separation, the father moving into a nearby apartment. The story is set in suburban Delaware, although the setting seems unimportant, is barely mentioned. The time is the 70s, during the gas shortages and long lines at service stations (hence the title). Other characters here are Gumma, the father's alcoholic mother who lives in Florida (the children fly there unaccompanied for a visit and learn to make Gumma's Margaritas and drive her golf cart); the mother's local parents, Grandmom (horrified at her daughter's 'broken home') and Grandpop (who falls asleep in his chair and belches often); Sarah, the father's new 'girlfriend;' Cliff, the mother's nice, new 'friend,' who moves in with his twelve year-old son, Marcus, who is a kind of evil Eddie Haskell type. And there is the unnamed family cat, who appears and disappears intermittently - and may symbolize something about the failing marriage and imploding family - or not.<br /><br />Their story is told in short snippets, emphasizing first one character's thoughts, then another's, with the omniscient narrator getting deep into the thoughts, hopes, fears and frustrations of each. Let me offer a few examples, pulled from the text at random. The girl -<br /><br />\"Sometimes the girl gets mad for no reason. The girl will get mad at her mother, or she'll get angry with her brother. God, can she get angry with her brother. Sometimes just the sight of him watching TV with his dopey brother face all slack and spacey, or chewing his food the way he does, his mouth agape, his fingers slick with pizza grease, is enough to set her off. It's like the girl feels a little mad about something all the time now.\"<br /><br />The father -<br /><br />\"Should the father ask the mother why she lets the boy mow the yard? Should the father offer to knock down the wasp nest growing inside the porch light fixture? Is the garage door coming off the track again? Is the woodpile in need of stacking? Is the father still the father?\"<br /><br />The mother -<br /><br />\"A problem: Cliff wants to spend the night. Solution: let Cliff spend the night on a weekend when the children are at their father's. Problem: what to do when Cliff wants to spend the night when the children are not at their father's? Solution: bill the event as a Marcus Sleepover! But will the children buy it? The mother cannot tell. She sets up Marcus in the guest bedroom, where her husband slept those last few weeks in the house. The room still holds his unhappy breath, or at least she needs to open the windows more often. There's little left of her husband in this room really \u2026\"<br /><br />The boy -<br /><br />\"The father has a hard time paying attention to the children, but the boy is only starting to catch on to that, now that he and his sister have returned from Florida. The father asks the boy questions about their trip, about Gumma, about all the things they did together, but doesn't pay attention to the boy's answers. It's sad, the way his father can't quite pay attention, the boy thinks, without the least feeling of anger. His poor dad, wanting to be nice, wanting to be a good dad, who asks his children questions, who listens, who takes time to let his children know how much they matter to him - all that.\"<br /><br />There are faint echoes of Salinger here, in the premature wisdom of the children's musings, the selfishness and floundering about by the adults. But to be honest, it seems to me that Varallo has created something entirely brand new here, in the way he tells his story of a failed marriage and a family falling apart. The account is, by turns, hilarious and heartbreaking. I laughed and chuckled, winced and frowned. It is an intimate \"between the lines\" story of a family. It is also a close look at what happens when family members fail to stay between the lines, or when they try to color outside the lines. Can you tell I'm having a hard time trying to characterize this book? Well I am. THE LINES. Hmm \u2026 You just have to READ it, okay? You will be drawn in from the first page. I was. You will NOT WANT to put it down! Did I say I loved this book? Okay. I LOVED THIS BOOK. Bravo, Mr Varallo.

Chapter Two discusses data input from a paper instrument, such as a survey, to a spreadsheet or text file.  The third chapter addresses common problems encountered when initially manipulating data.  Procedures covered include recoding, assigning variable and value labels, dealing with missing data, and merging data files.  Chapter Four teaches readers to \"debug\" their data by checking systematically for out-of-range or implausible values.  Chapter Five reviews commonly-used statistical procedures and the data requirements of each.  Finally, Chapter Six discusses organization, storage, and use of the output from statistical analysis.  This output becomes new data with its own error-checking requirements.<br /><br />The book is well organized and contains numerous examples in SAS and SPSS.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Explores human relationships under extreme circumstances", "text": "This is a fine book, carefully written, with a disturbing social commentary that underlies a narrative that is primarily about human relationships.  It would not necessarily be appropriate to classify this book as science fiction yet it is oddly futuristic and certainly is a commentary on the ability to create clones of humans and then to harvest the organs of the clones over time through a series of transplant operations.  This aspect of the story gradually reveals itself through the lives, experiences, and relationships between three young people; Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy.<br /><br />These three young people were reared in a special school that educated the clones in the arts, music, sports, and basic education. Hailsham seems to be a progressive educational institution, yet because critical information is not fully revealed to the young people at Hailsham, multiple plots and conspiracies develop in the minds of the young people. The book thus explores the social bonds and relationships that develop among parentless children.  Not having parents means that the teachers in the school, the Guardians, are the only real adult role models for the kids. Therefore the kids form cliques and groups that include or exclude others and develop a society and social structure similar to that seen in middle schools across the nation. Some kids are in and some kids are out.  Ruth is a struggler to remain always in the right crowd. Tommy is explosive and transparent and thus is usually a victim and is considered to be on the outside. Kathy is an introspective reflective loner who forms bonds with Ruth and Tommy, whom she carefully observes and understands. Eventually the characters graduate from Hailsham and move to the Cottages which appear to be for high-school and college age clones, awaiting training first as carers and then as donors. Other clones were not as lucky where little resources were expended on them and they were expected to begin making organ donations upon reaching biological adulthood.<br />The futuristic medical establishment is never revealed and the teachers for the clones and the doctors and nurses who harvest the organs never refer to the large medical infrastructure that would support such a system as this book implies.<br /><br />The book focuses more on the creation of family among those who have no family and the subtle nuances of tone, body language, choice of phrase that all imply how far we are into or out of a relationship with another. At this, the novel soars and is far more an anatomy of relationships than it was an anatomy of the body organs that these young folks eventually willingly give up as their fate in life. Beautifully written, this book is of the highest merit.", "images": [], "asin": "1400078776", "parent_asin": "1400078776", "user_id": "AE7ES2UA5N2JCEHUR5MZ6IU5RZ6A", "timestamp": 1214073082000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

He falls in love with a pen pal, who is going to undergo surgery and can become paralyzed. Such is the beginning.<br /><br />True to Victorian times, a large part of the book is spent in Gerard reading old manuscripts, nice short ghostly tales somehow never reaching the finesse that Ms. Byatt achieved in Possession. Perhaps Mr. Harwood did borrow, albeit unconciously from that book, perhaps not.<br /><br />It is so well written that time and pages fly quickly. Ultimately, everything is neatly tied in with a rather unbelievable climax. Still, a very tidy book. Good ghost stories are hard to come by and the last one was also from Australia, Richard Adams' (Watership Down) The Girl On The Swing.That was a real spine tingler.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Uneven but Good", "text": "Within a few pages of this David Sedaris book, I was seething with rage. \"This is about as funny as a car wreck,\" I said to myself. Although I hate to start a book and never finish reading it, I tossed this one aside in disgust, vowing never to return to its poisoned pages. Well, I did pick it up a few days later and I am glad that I did. The problem was the first few stories. The humor in the first three or four stories is juvenile and just plain dumb. It is the style of humor one finds in our middle schools. Once you get past those clunkers, the following stories and essays crackle with humor and dark emotion.<br />My favorite stories were his holiday stories, namely \"Season's Greetings,\" and \"The SantaLand Diaries (this story is why I originally wanted to buy the book).\" I don't think I really need to go into the SantaLand story since it popular enough that most people have heard of it or read it. As someone who did the retail thing, I recognize many customers and personality types in this story. I am surprised more people haven't mentioned \"Season's Greetings.\" This story is an absolute scream. It is written in the form of a Christmas card-type letter written by Jocelyn Dunbar. Poor, poor Jocelyn. Her family is sorry to announce the arrival of Khe Sahn (!), a Vietnamese strumpet who turns up on the Dunbar doorstep. Khe Sahn is the illegitimate daughter of Clifford, Jocelyn's husband, conceived during his tenure in Vietnam. I don't want to ruin the whole story for you, but I will say the way that the story is written adds greatly to the humor. The breezy, forced joviality of the letter just killed me.<br />Other stories in this collection are just as entertaining, although much darker and thoughtful. \"After Malison\" tells the story of an arrogant literary jerk and an encounter with her favorite post-modern writer. \"Don's Story\" reveals the vacuous nature of Hollywood. \"Jamboree\" is a depressing story about an unwanted child and his jerk parents. All of the stories will arouse some type of emotion in you, whether it is rage, happiness, or tears depends on the type of person you are.<br />Sedaris does have insightful perception on various aspects of society and when he is writing at top form, he shines.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Pretty Close to Reality", "text": "I have become quite fond of a handful of comic strips in the daily paper. Baby Blues is one of my favorite because it strikes a recognizable chord with memories of families whose children have passed before my eyes in the classroom, not to forget in certain family situations. The Family MacPhersons as they are named, portray everyday family life, that is different vignettes, not necessarily total for any one family.<br />Mom and Dad manage these two toddlers, often being taught the ropes by these two little packages of psychological tricksters, playing against each other, and playing one parent against the other.<br />If you \"read\" this book, a \"treasury\" of comic strips over the years, you can pretty well learn from Zoe (the older sister), and her brother Hammie, how they attempt to outsmart their Mom and Dad. I particularly like the cover picture, as the reader doesn't necessarily know \"who it is that is in diapers for 10 years\". There may be an analogy of the cartoonists, Kirkman and Scott to portray the parents as close peers of the two little tricksters/manipulators, and thus the diapers for Mom and Dad, as well, as the two children trying to hold the parents at their level.<br />If you're looking for a good laugh, borrow this from your local library where this book is catalogued under the Dewey Decimal Number 741.5. You can even have \"Baby Blues\" as part of your Yahoo home page of favorites; if so, you'll get a daily snapshot of this family, without any effort.

Using this technique, the reader doesn't really get into the head of the main character, but that makes the story all the more intriguing since we don't know what he's planning or thinking or even what his true motivations are.<br />APT PUPIL (I haven't seen this film) was scary because it was so realistic.  We see the characters going from a respectable student and a quiet old man to two people giving in to their base desires.  While one of them welcomes this as a return to things familiar, we see the other one struggle against them, knowing that they are wrong, but not being able to do anything about it.  This is a truly horrific story, but it contains none of King's usual supernatural elements.<br />The third story, THE BODY, is the best in the book.  I've only seen the first twenty minutes or so of STAND BY ME (which is based on this story), so I didn't really know what to expect.  Some of King's best work comes when he is telling coming of age stories of teens or pre-teens.  IT and CHRISTINE were brilliant and I now have to put this story in that category.  No true horror here, just a story about four ordinary friends in middle America spending the last weekend of the summer together.  This is King's trademark brilliant character interaction and development.  The story itself isn't all that exciting, but watching these boys together makes the story a very enjoyable read.<br />Finally, we have THE BREATHING METHOD.  While not as engrossing as the other stories, it does get back to King's supernatural twist at the end.  I enjoyed reading it, but it just didn't grab me the way the others in this book did.  I'm not sure I can really pinpoint why because the characters were just as developed.<br />Anyway, if you're a King fan, you'll definitely enjoy these stories.  If you haven't read King before, don't read these expecting to be surrounded by the macabre.  These truly show off King's strengths as a storyteller by stripping away all the horror and supernatural elements.  He's probably one of the best writers in America today and these stories prove it.", "images": [], "asin": "0451167538", "parent_asin": "0451167538", "user_id": "AEJ3I5PLQYMAWIPEZC2ILPNS7JMA", "timestamp": 1001526840000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A wonderful book for helping your young child", "text": "Such a wonderful book! It comes at a time for our family when Grandma's health is declining. For our daughter who is nearly three, Grandma seems a bit scary, since she doesn't look and act quite like herself. When we visit Grandma, she tends to moan a bit, which is very frightening to our toddler.<br /><br />This beautiful story is about a boy named Bobby and his Grandfather, Bob, who lives with Bobby and his parents. They have a lovely relationship; they spend lots of time together, building with blocks and sharing stories. Bobby especially likes for Bob to tell him the story about how Bobby learned to walk... ''Now one foot, now the other.''<br /><br />When Bobby is 5 years old, Bob has a stroke, and the little boy is frightened by the changes in his grandfather. Once Bob finally gets home from the hospital, he doesn't seem to recognize Bobby. The first sound Bob tries to make ''sounds like a monster'' to Bobby, but Bobby learns to understand Bob and, through love and persistence, is instrumental in Bob's recovery.<br /><br />I'm sure that this book will help my daughter to understand why Grandma isn't quite herself. Hopefully, our visits to see Grandma will be less stressful for her (and for me). After reading this story to my toddler at least dozen times (we received this book in the mail just three days ago), I can finally keep from tearing up until the very last page.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Makes you think about what it would really be like to meet a celebrity", "text": "Rockoholic was an interesting book. The plot kept me captivated until the end. The British slang terms got a little confusing. At the beginning, they took away from the story. The further I progressed into the story, the more they were reused and I think I got a general understanding of what most of them mean. The story focuses on Jody who is in love with Jackson, the lead singer of The Regulators. There is a small problem with that. Jackson doesn't know she exists. When she gets a chance to go to a Regulator concert, she kidnaps Jackson with the help of a Curly Wurly bar. The book got a little silly at times, but in a good way. It made me chuckle quite a few times. I think the book accurately portrays withdraw and detoxing. Although, I wish the author would have given a little more detail about the process. I liked most of the characters. At first I couldn't stand Jackson. Towards the end of the book he redeems himself and becomes a cool person. My favorite character was Mac. I liked how loyal he was to Jody. Even though he could have walked away from the epic mess Jody got him into, he still helped her out. He was very passionate in everything he did. He put 100 percent into his acting and his relationships with friends and family. The book will definitely make you want to watch Rocky Horror Picture Show, whether you've seen it or not.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Drama, humor and romance", "text": "This novel is amusing at times, and bittersweet or poignant at others. Sasha has moved home to care for her mother, Fleur, who was stricken with cancer 5 years ago. She seems to have one friend, Bobbi, who cares for her as more than a friend.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "My rating: 5/5", "text": "*My review* [MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS]:<br /><br />I am speechless after reading this. It\u2019s because I whole heartedly love this book, which was also the reason why it left me completely entirely heart-brokened. I am not joking when I\u2019m saying whilst reading the last few pages, I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and literally crying hysterically. I must admit I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as emotionally stable right now. I don\u2019t want to spoil the journey but I just want to say Tarryn Fisher is cruel. She is just damn cruel. This book was a straight 6-hour no sleep read for me, I couldn\u2019t stop, even if I wanted to. Trust me I did, I wanted to stop before reaching the final chapter, what I fear would happen had happened. Even though I prepared for the worst, I still couldn\u2019t take it when it finally hit me. I know you\u2019re thinking I\u2019m being dramatic, but no I\u2019m not. Not after this book. Instantly writing this review straight after finishing the book didn\u2019t give me an opportunity for my strong emotions to fade either. I\u2019m trying to keep it fresh for you guys though!<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />The plot was genuinely amazing. How the hell did anyone figure that out? I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going on in that mind of Tarryn Fisher\u2019s. I\u2019ve never read this kind of genre before, for me it wasn\u2019t just a regular NA novel, but \u2018dark\u2019 definitely fits into the category. I may sound like a hypocrite, because I used to mention I loved fairytales and happy endings but I guess the reason I was drawn into this novel was that it was not fairytale material. It portrays the cynicism of people and society, and I would agree is an accurate depiction of the real world we live in. This is by far, one of my favourite group of characters ever. I love how all of them aren\u2019t perfect, but deep down lost in their own waves of betrayal, denial and revenge. The story starts as Olivia regretting her mistake leading to a breakup with Caleb. She knows that Caleb hates her, and never wants to see her again. But what if you get a second chance? Can she start all over again, clean slate? That chance comes to her as Caleb has amnesia due to his accident and no longer remember hers. Opportunity comes and she grabs it. So in love with Caleb, she\u2019s willing to do anything to get him back. These involving the ugly stuff, where tears get spilled, hearts get broken, and love gets lost in the lies, secrets and the dirty plots.<br /><br />Main Characters + actor/actress that I think would fit the role:<br /><br />Olivia Kaspen \u2013 If you\u2019re looking for the kind loving and pretty woman, Olivia\u2019s not it. Well she is pretty, but underneath the pretty face is the eager selfish wolf ready to attack at any moment. Olivia is difficult to describe, she\u2019s like ten girls into one. I would say that she is an emotionally wrecked character, trust isn\u2019t her strong suit due to her past experiences, so she creates a barrier surrounding herself with her cold personality, and pushes anyone possible to coming close to her away, to keep a safe distance. Nevertheless she is someone who definitely gets what she wants and she will make sure it happens.<br /><br />Actress: Jillian Murray<br /><br />Caleb Drake \u2013 You might think he\u2019s perfect. The rich unquestionably handsome and charming man. Close, but not at all what it seems, he\u2019s also a character who\u2019s been through a lot. Because of his unconditional love for Olivia, he has been hurt by her again and again. But even though he\u2019s been hurt countless of times, he still can\u2019t live without her, because it would hurt more. He wanted her as part of his life, anyway possible. It would be unfair to blame it all on Olivia because he did make some s***ty mistakes too. Their relationship was like a ticking time bomb constantly ready for a spark to light the fuel.<br /><br />Actor: Henry Cavil<br /><br />My favourite quotes from the book (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT)<br /><br />\u201cBecause I am a Llama and you are a bird and WE are not compatible.\u201d \u2013 Olivia<br /><br />\u201cI was a relationship retard.

So much technical jargon, that after a while you just go with it, without really visualizing what any of them mean.<br /><br />So in the beginning you are introduced to an interstellar war looming: The space barbarians, called ousters are preparing to destroy the world called Hyperion.<br />\"Space barbarians\" - this sounds just wrong on every level. As I think of a barbarian, I picture a bare chest man with a beard and a Viking helmet and two axes running at you screaming, not someone on a spaceship. What a mess! it just sets a wrong precedence early on in this book. Then the further you read the more it feels like this book is based on religion; there are Christianity themes, Islam themes and even Buddhism.<br />So once again - how is this a sci-fi? 7 random characters are assembled for a pilgrimage that all travel on a tree-ship, which sounds like something out of a fantasy book, not a sci-fi, so how are we supposed to take this book seriously?<br /><br />The characters are completely boring, lack of depth and failing to form any emotional connection with a reader.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Not for fundamentalists", "text": "This is the book that resulted in Rushdie's having to flee a \"fatwa\" (death sentence) from the Ayatollah Khomeini. To a fundamentalist of any sort, the book is clearly anathema, for it is based on the understanding that most great religions start by reaching toward truth through myth; its subject is the intersection of myth and truth, and the different ways that good and evil can borrow one another's clothing. It is, in fact, a critique of religion -- not ultimately a negative one, but certainly one that refuses to take anything as given.<br /><br />Falling to earth after their hijacked airplane has exploded in midair, two Indian actors, the one a star in his own country, the other as Anglicized as they come, land miraculously on the English coast. One finds himself turning into the Archangel Gabriel, the other into the Devil himself. This is only the start of many miracles and transformations in a feat of linguistic legerdemain that leaps between modern London and the East in the time of the Prophet, teeming with brilliant characters, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, but all the while dealing with serious topics such as the nature of faith, national identity, and the redeeming power of love.<br /><br />Reviewing [[ASIN:B000O70PZE THE MOOR'S LAST SIGH]], I suggested that it might be modeled on Dante's INFERNO; along the same lines, this is Rushdie's PARADISE LOST. But Milton is far from the only author to whom Rushdie tips his hat in this heady book; an annotated edition might well take up a third of each page in footnotes! Some may find this infuriating; personally, I feel exhilarated -- but I have to abandon any hope of getting more than half of Rushdie's multilingual, multicultural references, as much at home in Bollywood pop as classic Persian poetry. His gift for language is quite extraordinary, whether jamming words together, exploding them, or inventing new ones with Joycean abandon.<br /><br />I must admit that the surface fascination of Rushdie's detail is such as to make it hard to read the book fast enough to get a clear sense of the direction of the whole; in both of his books that I have read, there was a difficult passage of 80 pages or so about two-thirds of the way through. But it is certainly worth perservering, for in this book especially Rushdie achieves a kind of transcendance by turning his back on his previous fireworks and ending in a style of disarming simplicity. The two final sections of the book are especially effective: a religious pilgrimage heading into a situation that can only be resolved by some kind of miracle, and an old man (not a major character, so no spoiler) dying of cancer. Simplicity as benediction; brilliance resolved as quiet beauty.<br /><br />This is a world-class author writing about major themes of immediate relevance, and not afraid to do so in a style that is a combustible mixture of high erudition and popular entertainment.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "\"You are about to find out who runs this place, and it isn't you.\"", "text": "In this six-volume series set in Blackstone, New Hampshire, a \"dark figure\" has been drawn back to the long-abandoned Blackstone Asylum, which is being developed into a shopping mall.  Having found the trove of personal objects which once belonged to residents of the Asylum, the \"dark figure\" begins to wreak vengeance by distributing them throughout the town, each \"gift\" resulting in horror.  Here in Volume 4, John Saul once again uses Rebecca Morrison, the slightly handicapped survivor of a terrible accident which killed her parents, as the unwitting instrument of the horror which follows.<br /><br />(No spoilers.)  When Oliver Metcalf, editor of the local newspaper, searches through some old records in his attic, stored there because his father was the superintendent of the Asylum fifty years ago, he finds a beautiful handkerchief in the files.  Since it has the letter \"R\" on it, he decides to give it to Rebecca, her first gift in a long time.  When Germaine Wagner, the woman with whom Rebecca lives, appropriates it and gives it to her demanding, elderly mother, the stage is set for another tale of horror.<br /><br />Once again, Saul begins the story by introducing a scene of torture in the Asylum.  This time, however, he provides the name of one of the sadistic employees, making the action in this tale far more satisfying than in earlier ones because the developing horror seems directed and not simply random.  As in previous novels, Oliver Metcalf is the victim of blinding headaches, fainting spells, and visions of horror related to the Asylum, and his own background, involving the mysterious death of his twin sister at the age of four, is introduced, though he has no memory of crucial events.<br /><br />As the town begins to suspect that the \"suicides\" featured in previous novels may be connected to the Asylum, the series tension builds, not because of the gory tales but because the reasons for the horror and the choice of specific victims remain unclear.  One wonders who is the \"dark figure\" and what has made him return--and who will be the next victim, and why.<br /><br />This novel is the turning point in the series.  The \"dark figure\" hints that he is beginning to recall events and a character disappears, though there is no reason to suspect that foul play has occurred.  Though Saul develops the suspense connecting the novels slowly, it is clear that he has a grand finale planned. n  Mary Whipple", "images": [], "asin": "044922788X", "parent_asin": "044922788X", "user_id": "AHZZL323ORE6AHMIB2OCLYNCRXJQ", "timestamp": 1136837279000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A decent enough beach read", "text": "This is a fairly interesting book, given the hoopla surrounding it. People have been comparing this to various books, especially Fifty Shades of Grey, due to the book containing a moderate amount of sex scenes. I need to say straight off that I'm not  a Fifty Shades fan, so when I picked this up I was more expecting to find something new to poke fun at.<br /><br />People picking this up hoping that it will contain as many sex scenes as FSoG will be disappointed. Yes, there is sex in the work, but it's nowhere near as prevalent as some of the professional reviews would have you believe. The book *is* liberally sprinkled with sex or references to it, but it's more of an afterthought than anything else and Hilton could have probably removed or reduced many of these scenes without harming the novel. Doing this probably would have worked out well for Hilton, as the critics were right about one thing. The sex scenes are easily the weakest part of the book. They're not awful, but they just feel a bit superfluous at times. It's not Laurell K Hamilton level, where her characters go &#34;OK! STOP - SEXY TIME&#34; (my apologies to MC Hammer) at ridiculous moments, so the book does have that going for it.<br /><br />The characters are OK enough for the most part, although the majority of them just sort of faded in and out of the book. I don't know that I could really name many of the characters outside of Judith and Rupert, as I forgot about many of them once they'd served their purpose in the book. Judith is relatively interesting, as she's far from a likable person but still has some occasional twinges of regret now and again.<br /><br />Maestra really takes off whenever Hilton starts writing about art and the forged paintings, as this is easily the most entertaining stuff in the book and I can't help but wish that there was more of this as opposed to the sex and murder. I like books that have unlikeable, yet compelling lead characters, but this just wasn't quite a four star read for me. It's certainly entertaining and would make for a good beach read, but I can't help but hope that Hilton manages to work out the kinks in part two of the series otherwise I'm not sure that the Maestra series has enough gusto to make a satisfying trilogy.", "images": [], "asin": "0399184260", "parent_asin": "0399184260", "user_id": "AFAAY32MQYRA56IVSVNSCDLNE62A", "timestamp": 1461821150000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful Explanation of How to Apply A Theory to A Problem", "text": "This is a unique book, and so I don't know that it will work as well for other people.  Sornette does not hesitate to use equations, including writing down differential equations and solutions.  He uses them sparingly and puts many word explanations around them, but know that if you plan to read this book Sornette is not going to skip the math.  I think he does an excellent job of explaining things without the math, but I always appreciate having the equations available.<br /><br />For the book itself, Sornette explains the theory of log-periodicity (LPPLS, log periodic power law singularity, nowadays) in the context of the stock market.  He starts with explaining the theory of randomness and the basic economics that drive stock markets and then talks about his theory of bubbles forming and how one may be able to predict them.<br /><br />I like this book a lot because it presents an idea, and could work well as an explanation of how creating a scientific model works.  The author also admits the shortcomings in the theory and offers it as one way that can sometimes be useful.  The fact that it is now about 20 years old also gives it an interesting flavor, and reading some of the cited works is worth it, as well.<br /><br />I'm not completely convinced of the log-periodicity claim, but it does seem plausible, and certainly worth exploration (it has, of course, been more explored in the intervening years), and using the theory to predict crashes and bubbles seems like it could give you some interesting insights or at least perspectives.  I'd recommend looking for some of the critiques online, though, as well.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a fan of this type of explain-your-model books.  Even if the model turns out not to be as accurate for the phenomena involved, it explains how you one can think through a problem, come up with some sort of solution, and ways to test it.  Obviously, this process can vary a lot depending on circumstances, but seeing how someone does it always fascinates me.", "images": [], "asin": "0691175950", "parent_asin": "0691175950", "user_id": "AHDB4MTGAFZQFPFUBC2GCW3H5MRA", "timestamp": 1637437670152, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

Seriously, the dollar amounts are so large (measured in TRILLIONS of dollars) that even after dividing by US population size (300+ million) the effect on each of us is significant.<br /><br />Mr. Taibbi has a difficult task. These scams succeed because the financial methods employed are terribly complicated. Hence, there is not much need for secrecy. Instead, the scams succeed because most people do not understand the events that occur in plain sight.<br /><br />Mr. Taibbi's approach is to use language and emotion to make this information interesting.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good plot, well-drawn and memorable main characters, some witty dialogs", "text": "One way to describe this thrilling, mystery-laden fantasy novel is to characterize it as an action-packed tale of aristocratic lunacies that manages to lightly touch upon serious topics such as the unjustness of women's lower standing relative to men's in a patriarchal society, the cruel treatment of the poor by the rich, and the tensions between scientific and faith-based reasoning, while still keeping it a relatively fun read for young adults.<br /><br />The novel's setting is an alternate 19th-century Ireland where the existence of non-procreating machine-animal breeds known as &#34;engimals&#34; are the subject of intense curiosity as mysterious examples of life forms that Darwin's newly expounded theory of evolution cannot account for. Somehow, these &#34;engimals&#34; have some sort of linkage to the Wildensterns whose ancestry goes several centuries back.<br /><br />Gifted with an ability to live very long lives and a physiology that helps them heal quickly, the Wildensterns are obscenely wealthy and powerful, owning properties and businesses in Ireland, Britain, and America.  Edgar, the current patriarch, has three sons designated to succeed him in the following order: Marcus, Roberto, and Nate.  As part of their upbringing, Edgar's heirs have all been taught, before the age of 16, the art of assassination and how to live by the eight &#34;Rules of Ascension&#34; which, aiming to encourage ambition and aggression, two qualities thought critical to the bloodline's continued success, make it perfectly honorable for an heir, 16 years or older, to murder a higher-ranking heir for the sole purpose of advancing one's own ranking.<br /><br />The kind of lunacy this can lead to should be predictable.  In fact, shortly after the novel's opening, readers learn that Marcus has been found dead.  Many suspect that Edgar's youngest son, Nate, having the most to gain from his eldest brother's death, may have assassinated Marcus. Just to make things even more mysterious, when centuries old Wildenstern ancestors suddenly rise from the dead, everyone is suddenly asking: Should Edgar welcome these resurrected ancestors back into the fold, and for what reasons?<br /><br />The tale initially develops at a leisurely pace in the first half of the novel, but the pace picks up significantly after that, with quite a few interesting twists and turns.  The main characters are well-drawn and memorable, and some of the dialogs are witty.  There is some violence, a bit of religious talk, and a brief scene involving a homosexual kiss. If none of these is a big concern, you may want to give this action-packed, well written young adult novel your consideration.", "images": [], "asin": "1497665701", "parent_asin": "1497665701", "user_id": "AFMSKPD5ZG6NEOIQCYATQKQQOTGQ", "timestamp": 1432004019000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "elegant", "text": "Reader thoughts:<br /><br />OK. I absolutely loved this book (yay for full-cast-audio), and it would the BEST ever except for this one scene I didn't like (the way Dashti defeated the bad guy, but at least it worked). That's me, picky.<br /><br />This book reminded me of Ella Enchanted in the sense that both authors use a lot of emotions to further the plot and side-characters that wreak havoc and the main character's love is in the dark about protagonist's biggest secret. SH, though, had a bigger overall plot involving countries, while GCL's was more compressed on a smaller scale within her own household (stepmother troubles and all that).<br /><br />Oh, and I loved the worldbuilding here. What other fantasy story mentions a pet yak? The kingdom is ruled not by a king but a Kahn! Also, even the religious system is believable and well developed. The traditions, superstitions, history, and music are all well put together and just make the story even better.  And the songs are simple but perfect.<br /><br />Usually, I don't like journal stories, but SH pulled it off quite well. It's even better than The Goose Girl.<br /><br />Writer thoughts<br /><br />Why did journalling work as a medium for this story, but it doesn't work for other stories? Here are my guesses.<br /><br />1, a lot of the conflicts lasted longer than one day. So, none of the danger was over when Dashti was penning the day's activities. She and Saren were still stuck in the tower, still starving. Sometimes Dashti even wrote in her journal while something was happening, and she would pause or sketch or wait in fear in the dark. This made the action feel real.<br /><br />2, inner dialogue and reflections. Dashti often added her own commentary later. Things like, &#34;I shouldn't have thought that about my lady; ancestors, forgive me!&#34; or &#34;Why didn't I say/do this?&#34; or &#34;I'll never forget the way he smells.&#34; It's delightful to read. We experience all her joy and regret with her.<br /><br />3, the journal was a plot point. First, she's chronicling her days in the tower, and the journal would be there to explain why two female corpses are locked in a tower. Later, she's lying about everything, and the journal would get her killed if someone found it. So, it is important.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Difficult and Frustrating", "text": "A difficult and frustrating book to read from beginning to end; but what it set out to do, it does with the greatest integrity. Each of the poets, in their own way, uses language, the foundation of communication, to obscure meaning and themselves.<br /><br />The book is representative of many of the current formal presentations in vogue, especially including obstructive line breaks (including prose poems), and various cryptic arrangements of the poetry on the page intended to mystify and repel more than communicate. Every work is strongly redolent of academic seminars and workshops (indeed, many have the imprimatur of academic institutions), and there is very little evidence of life experience or extensive exposure to other poetry\u2014old or new. I strongly suspect that, of the fifty \u201cbest young poets\u201d represented here, none will still be writing poetry ten years from now--unless they're required to by their choice of an academic profession.<br /><br />Obviously, I prefer poetry that is artful communication between the author and the reader/listener. Poems that are accessible, without being intellectually demeaning, and that invite the reader to enter and participate in the conversation, instead of shamed into silence. These are not those; but they do it so deliberately, so consistently that they merit five stars for realizing their strength of conviction.<br /><br />I've followed this series with a great deal of interest.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "My first true experience with \"Magical Realism\"", "text": "The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender is one the most unique books I have ever read. It is also my first true experience with &#34;Magical Realism,&#34; which I have decided I quite like.<br /><br />Why? The magic is woven into the mundane so naturally that rules and explanations would ruin the effect. It just is. In this particular story, the metaphors are literal as well. I'm not sure if that is how the magic operates in this world (no explanations) or if it is common in magical realism. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the literal twist. For example, a character was so happy, he grew two inches. Normally we would read that as he stood taller, more proud. No, he literally grew two inches right there on the spot. Another character was so sad, she began disappearing within herself. She literally began disappearing, fading over time. Fantastic!<br /><br />My favorite literal metaphor/theme, was that of love birds. The Lavender family is unlucky in love. They also possess a strange and beautiful connection to birds, even becoming birds or being born with wings. This is a tale of many sorrows until the three prominent women featured learn that love can set them free from the cage they put around their life and become the wind beneath their wings--as the saying goes--enabling them to soar and experience new heights.<br /><br />The story oscillates between third person omniscient point of view (head hopping), third person intimate (from a specific character's point-of-view), and first person. It was done so seamlessly, that it rarely pulled me from the story. I love it when POV storytelling is jumbled up like this, similar to The Night Circus.<br /><br />The characters are deeply flawed. I found it was easy to sympathize and care for each one. It's through their sorrows and mistakes that the readers are able to truly appreciate how they overcame their trials to a place of inner-peace and new-found joy.<br /><br />I give The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender 4-4.25 stars.

I didn't have a problem with that. But it drives me crazy to have the intonation of the narration go up at the end of the sentence making everything sound like a question.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Bone Chilling Tales of the Strange", "text": "Algernon Blackwood writes some very creepy stories. Born in 1869 to a ruling class family in Kent, England, Blackwood failed to live up to the expectations of his ultra religious parents. After attending the University of Edinburgh, the young man headed to Canada, then a part of the British Empire. In Canada Blackwood failed at several different endeavors, including an attempt at journalism, running a milk farm, and managing a bar. Algernon then went to New York City where he lived in penniless isolation. It was here that the future novelist encountered the seedy side of humanity, including dangerous criminals, con men, and other assorted unsavory types. Most people, when confronted with such a bleak atmosphere, would give up in frustration. Blackwood did not; he caught a break when a wealthy individual hired him as a private secretary. His eventual return to England led to the start of his writing career, a career as the premier author of supernatural fiction.<br /><br />This compilation of Blackwood stories, compiled by E.F. Bleiler in the early 1970s, contains several of Blackwood's most lauded tales. The stories vary in length from fifty pages to less than ten pages. The title of Bleiler's collection, \"Best Ghost Stories of Algernon Blackwood,\" is more than a little misleading. There are only three stories dealing with spirits from beyond the grave here, and only one of those, \"The Listener,\" is truly creepy. The best stories in this book, without a doubt, are two of the lengthier contributions: \"The Willows\" and \"The Wendigo,\" which must rank as the eeriest stories ever written. Blackwood has the amazing ability to introduce not only deep sensations of terror, but to sustain and build that terror throughout the story. Every fan of horror must read Algernon Blackwood at some point.<br /><br />The first story, \"The Willows,\" sets the tone for the book. Two men sailing down the Danube River become trapped on an island during a flood. Immediately, strangeness rears its ugly head. The men sense that all is not right in their surroundings. Huge winds buffet the island, followed by unexplainable internal sensations of deep fear. Supplies start to disappear and the willow trees in the area seem to move of their own accord. A mysterious hole in the canoe means the men will have to stay on the island longer than planned. Blackwood never explains exactly what plagues the two travelers, but he does hint at dark forces that are attempting to force themselves into our world. This yarn ranks high on the shudder meter.<br /><br />The second story that makes this collection worth owning is \"The Wendigo.\" There are no ghosts rattling chains in this tale. Blackwood instead introduces the reader to a group of men on a hunting trip in the remoteness of backwoods Canada. Two of the men head out to a region that local Indians claim is haunted by a Wendigo, a creature who lifts men right off the ground and feeds off of them. This story is fantastic, arguably one of the best horror stories ever written. If you have ever gone out into the woods at night, far from the safety of home, you will instantly recognize the dark terror suffered by Simpson as he looks for the vanished guide Defago. I get chills just thinking about this story.<br /><br />A third story worth noting is \"The Listener,\" a ghost yarn set in a rundown house in London. A struggling writer rents a room in this old residence, but slowly realizes something is amiss in his new digs. He gets intense headaches, becomes aware of strange footsteps in the house, and notices that someone (or something) is watching him while he sleeps. There are great scenes in this story, and the final line uttered by one of this man's friends is about as unsettling as things get in this genre. For those who enjoy a great ghost story, \"The Listener\" promises to deliver the goods. Blackwood tells the story through journal entries jotted down by the protagonist, allowing the reader of the story to get a sense of passing time and increasing weirdness.<br /><br />These three stories are the best of the lot, but by no means the only effective chillers chosen for inclusion by Bleiler. For example, \"Max Hensig\" is about a murderer hunting down a journalist who had the gall to make disparaging comments about him in the city paper. There is nothing supernatural about \"Max Hensig,\" but it is a great story well worth reading. Other stories deal with nature run amuck or the appearance of devils and demons. There is something for everybody in this great book.<br /><br />Every story in the book starts the same way. One of the main characters quickly realizes that something is terribly wrong, usually through what we recognize as a \"sixth sense\" or a \"gut feeling,\" an extrasensory perception that tells us we are in big trouble. Having his characters recognize the \"wrongness\" of a situation is exactly what Blackwood set out to do. His interest was not in Wendigos or ghosts as much as it was in how man perceives these unknowns. Blackwood often ends his stories with no firm resolutions, with nothing more than speculation about what happened. This adds to the general sense of uneasiness.<br /><br />Blackwood must have influenced later writers like H.P. Lovecraft. Unfortunately, there are no clear successors to Algernon Blackwood alive today. Modern horror relies on gruesome scenes and neat plotlines that wrap up as neatly as a Christmas gift. Gore is not necessarily a bad thing, but when it is a substitute for suspense and clever writing there is a big hole that needs filling. This English author neatly closes that gap with great stories full of suspense and eeriness. More Blackwood, I say!", "images": [], "asin": "0486229777", "parent_asin": "0486229777", "user_id": "AEJNB2KJ7VFBSXAEZD74D5VS2M6Q", "timestamp": 1052963965000, "helpful_vote": 72, "verified_purchase": false}

I never actually read Tom Sawyer (for which, I assure you, I feel a deep sense of shame) and I still managed to fully enjoy this book.<br />Joe has returned from his years as a pirate to Missouri and, after learning that his mother is gone, decides he's going to find himself a cave to crawl in, with the intention of dying there. Along the way to finding himself a cave, he finds himself in one predicament after another, as a character created by Mark Twain is bound to do (I've read plenty of Twain, just not Tom Sawyer. I'm not a complete philistine.) He finds himself in the company of a Chinese-American named Lee, who wants to return to his home in California, and an Amish woman named Ruth, who is running away from the man her father chose for her to marry. The three of them, without a cent between them (though Joe does have two sizable diamonds left from his pirating days) decide to live and travel like hobos in order to reach Lee's destination of San Francisco. They jump trains. They ride inside them when they can and on top of them when they have to. When they aren't catching free train rides, they're accidentally getting high with a strange group of men, getting taken in by kind prostitutes, and having adventures with a wealthy man pretending to be a hobo for the fun of it.<br />A couple of times, things look really bleak for one or more of our trio but somehow they always manage to find a way out. At one point, when we begin to think it really might be the end of our friend Joe, an old friend comes along just in time to save him and help him to rescue his friends.<br />This book is full of adventure, humor, friends and foes and it was a pleasure to read.", "images": [], "asin": "1944853049", "parent_asin": "1944853049", "user_id": "AFQDBLNM2JWF2OYKHDOHPKGASXPA", "timestamp": 1481773265000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Thrilling Debut", "text": "(No Spoilers) Part space opera, part adventure, and applicable to both young adult and adult readers, CassaStar is the thrilling debut novel by Alex J. Cavanaugh, science fiction writer and blogger.<br /><br />Alex has a simple writing style with good flow. I found myself quickly caught up in his prose. CassaStar is written in multiple PoV, limited to the two main characters of Byron and Bassa. Byron is an arrogant, insecure fighter pilot trainee, and Bassa is an experienced instructor with a stern disposition. I loved Bassa, and found Byron off-putting at first (though he does redeem himself). Particularly impressive was Alex's use of the telepathic abilities of Cassans in multiple point of view. At times it was omniscient, but very well done.<br /><br />The world-building in CassaStar is sparse, but intriguing, giving the reader a sense of the setting without inundating us with details. The pages turn quickly and I never found myself growing bored. CassaStar showcases character development in a science fiction atmosphere. It has many exciting moments of space combat, lasers, and explosions, but the core of CassaStar is the progression of Byron and Bassa. How they change and grow.<br /><br />This is one of the best science fiction debuts I have read in a long time. My largest complaint was a lack of female characters. Byron's sister makes an appearance, but it's short and lacks any reader empathy. What do these Cassan women do?<br /><br />Outside of that, CassaStar was a wonderful read that I would recommend to anyone interested in character driven science fiction. If you're a big softy like me, you may cry a bit, so you've been warned. CassaStar sucked me in and held me rapt. I cannot wait to read Alex's next novel and watch his craft steadily improve.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Classic Story About Toys and Love", "text": "The story of a boy who receives a toy rabbit as a Christmas gift, The Velveteen Rabbit is a beloved classic by Margery Williams. I enjoyed this tale as a child and, although my reasons for enjoying it have changed, to this day I have never tired of reading it. No matter how many picture books and chapter books I outgrew and passed on in my youth, The Velveteen Rabbit is one I knew I\u2019d always keep.<br /><br />As a child, at least part of the appeal of The Velveteen Rabbit lay in its fantastical element. As its subtitle says, it\u2019s a story about how toys become real. In that way, it\u2019s akin to Pinocchio, another beloved literacy character who wanted to be more than a toy. And, in my earliest years, I wanted to believe that my toys could become real. Not that my imaginings were straightforward. Rather, they were a mix of various fantasies. There was the one where my toys would talk at night when I was asleep. Or the one where my toys could invoke revenge on me if I allowed them to get damaged. And the one where all my discarded toys would end up in the land of misfit toys. All of these jumbled in my head, along with the one about where my toys would become real because of my love. And if I were to qualify any of my toys under the latter stipulation, it would have to be a floppy gaudy green and pink plush dog. It\u2019s hair is worn bare, an eye is missing, and various appendages have been taped to hold them together. For years, I slept with that doll. Today I still have it and it serves as my gravatar.<br /><br />Eventually, I outgrew my belief that toys could become real. Then the appeal of The Velveteen Rabbit lay solely in its message about love: \u201cIt takes a long time. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don\u2019t matter at all, because once you are Real you can\u2019t be ugly, except to people who don\u2019t understand.\u201d In Christian circles, the Skin Horse\u2019s advice can be used to explain to new converts how we start out as babes in Christ but through trials and tribulations become mature adults. Amongst friends, the advice can be used to explain why differences and disagreements are to be expected. As much as we might dislike it at the time, it\u2019s only those individuals who love every good and bad part of us who will become our best friends. In every relationship, the Skin Horse\u2019s advice can be applied. Back in our dating years, my husband and I used to quote the Skin Horse\u2019s various lines about being real as a sentimental but profoundly true way of expressing what growing old together would mean.<br /><br />While rereading The Velveteen Rabbit this past weekend, I felt struck by a couple of critical questions. Barely two pages in, Williams rambles about how the mechanical toys felt superior to the others. They apparently had modern ideas. A jointed lion even pretended he was connected with the Government. I don\u2019t know what I thought of these lines as a child, but now I\u2019m sure that I completely understand them. Then there was the fact that after the boy got sick with the scarlet fever, all the toys in the nursery were to be thrown away. Immediately I wondered whatever happened to the Skin Horse? Yet these two questions didn\u2019t diminish my enjoyment of The Velveteen Rabbit. As Williams rambled on about the expensive toys snubbed by our hero, I felt mostly empathy for how insignificant and commonplace the Velveteen Rabbit felt. With regards to the Skin Horse, I can only surmise that either he escaped the fate of being tossed or he too experienced a visit from the nursery magic fairy. Only we just hear of her visit to Velveteen Rabbit, because the book is about our hero.<br /><br />The Velveteen Rabbit has been around since 1922. Since that time, it has remained a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children\u2019s theater as well as on radio, television, and the big screen. Every generation will have a chance to experience its beauty in one form or another.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Some helpful things, a lot of fluff", "text": "This is a self-help series that might help you or someone you know, but it takes a long time to get to the point.  It would have been better as a book, a short book.<br /><br />What you get are 6 audio CDs and a DVD, plus a writeable \"work disc\" DVD.  The six audio CDs focus on things like taking a deep breath to \"reboot\", changing your perspective by going to higher ground, and (probably most importantly) visualizing your success before you actually undertake whatever you are trying to succeed at.  There are subsections on health, business, and family.  The DVD contains what seems like a long commercial for the series, plus an auditorium speech by the author, covering much of the same ground as the audio CDs.<br /><br />What I found frustrating was that there was a lot of time wasted here.  There's some \"uplifting music\" which goes on too long and is repeated throughout the audio CD series.  Then there are many moments where the author asks you to take 90 seconds to relax, breathe, and visualize something.. followed by 90 seconds of blank space on the CD.  I found myself fast forwarding a lot.<br /><br />The author also likes to name drop a lot, especially Alex Rodriguez whom the author claims to have coached with his outlook.  I'm a big fan of A-Rod (who isn't?) as he's not only been a hugely successful baseball player, but he's a great commentator, successful business guy, seems like a positive and thoughtful person.  I don't doubt that A-Rod sought out anything he thought could help him, anywhere he could get it, but I doubt that much of A-Rod's success is related to this \"90 second rule\" approach.  I will say that A-Rod improved his post-season play during his career, so if Fannin's coaching helped with that, it was time well spent.<br /><br />And one part I found borderline offensive was when the author implied he could beat cancer by thinking positive thoughts.  Now I don't doubt that a positive attitude is helpful to one's health, but if you have skin cancer you need surgery (I've had it myself), you can't expect to just \"will\" it away.  A positive mental attitude only takes you so far, and if it could take you to full health then we'd need only faith healers instead of qualified physicians.<br /><br />So \"90 Second Rule\" goes with the other self-help programs that seem to promise much, and deliver - something, but probably not as much as you'd hoped.  I'd put this about on a par with Tony Robbins, but I don't think much of Tony Robbins (yes I realize that he has fans).  And like TR, the author promotes drinking a lot of water, which is definitely good advice.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A great book that I wish was just a little better", "text": "&quot;Dr. Mardy&quot; Grothe is a retired clinical psychologist (thus the &quot;Dr.&quot;), management consultant, and speaker. But he is far from being retired as a quotation maven. In fact, this collection of quotations is his seventh word and language book, and provides a window into his on-line collection of metaphorical quotations that has already become the world's largest.<br /><br />Not only does Dr. Mardy collect quotations, drawing on hundreds of volumes in his personal library, but he verifies them. That verification is priceless -- I see so many nonfiction books that contain unverified quotations it makes me tear out my hair in frustration. &quot;No, Mark Twain didn't say that!&quot; &quot;No, Albert Einstein said nothing like that!&quot; &quot;Nice words, but it wasn't Carl Sagan who said them!&quot; Just to give three examples that I saw in business books the last couple of days.<br /><br />As Dr. Mardy explains in the text beginning this book, here he moves from being a quotation anthologist to being a quotation curator. He selects the ten best quotations in his on-line collection in 250 categories and presents them here. You thus get 2,500 quotations presented by topic collected and selected by a qualified curator. Not only do you get the quotations themselves, but you can get more quotations by scanning a QR code for each topic into your smartphone to take you to that topic on Dr. Mardy's on-line collection.<br /><br />That's what I liked about the book. Now here's what I don't like as much (though I still do recommend the book for any reader).<br /><br />First, the book is squat and fat. All told it is almost 500 pages, making it two inches thick (most books are one). While most books have pages that are about 9 inches by 6 inches, this book has pages that are about 7 inches by 5 inches. That may not sound like a big difference, but I was surprised to find how that made me less likely to carry the book around and dip into it. And since this is not the kind of book that makes good reading from cover to cover (for me it gets tiring to read quotations straight for more than about 10 minutes), that means I rarely read it.<br /><br />Second, I don't like how the quotations look on the page. They are in bold type, centered, with the author's name to the right and below in all capital letters. Most of the page is blank space -- over 90%. Obviously, some people like this look, or they wouldn't have done the book this way. And Dr. Mardy changed his weekly newsletter to this format too. (Sign up for that newsletter -- I've read it for more than 10 years, and it's a great thing to look forward to on Saturday nights.) But the format bothers me.<br /><br />Third, I wish each quotation gave the source of the quotation and the date. That information is in the on-line database, so it is available. But why not have it here in the book? I always want to know that kind of thing for every quotation, and not having it in the book where there is plenty of space for it irks me every time I read it.<br /><br />Fourth, and more philosophically, is a collection this big and (largely) unannotated all that helpful? Aren't quotations out of context and with no explanation a little like tweets on Twitter? Good for casual browsing, but often more thoughtless than thoughtful?<br /><br />Take one example that caught my eye -- a quotation from Sherry Turkle on computers (on page 82). It's an interesting quotation that I have seen before. (I've read all of Sherry Turkle's books.) But here it lacks the last line that almost always appears (and that appears in the on-line Dr. Mardy dictionary), and it lacks all context.<br /><br />If you check out that quotation, it comes from Sherry Turkle's 1984 book [[ASIN:0671468480 The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit]]. When that was written, there was no Internet, just the Arpanet. Computers were rather primitive and were often used most by &quot;hackers,&quot; who were different from modern-day hackers. She was referring in that phrase to how those hackers suffered from a modern neurosis. Without that context, and without knowing how her views have evolved along with computer technology, the quotation can easily be misinterpreted.<br /><br />I've gone on at length when I meant to be brief. So let me just end with a recommendation to buy this book, subscribe to Dr. Mardy's newsletter, and visit his on-line dictionary. (Unless you are one of those people who don't care about quality quotations. Then go to Goodreads, BrainyQuotes, or some other site on the Internet to get your inspiration, and miss out on the good stuff.)", "images": [], "asin": "0062445332", "parent_asin": "0062445332", "user_id": "AGT4S5Q7PPN6FST33GVNUVY5ZGCQ", "timestamp": 1486959787000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing and repetitive novel", "text": "I did not finish this book. It was very repetitive and uninteresting. While I was looking forward to reading about Catherine of Aragon - books about Henry VIII typically focus on Anne Boleyn and ignore Catherine's motivations - the execution was poor. First, there were significant implausibilities in the portrayal of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Gregory protrays them as rather open minded and solicitous of Islamic practices. Catherine is portrayed as very appreciative of the Muslim legacy of Spain. This is absolutely ridiculous, considering the fact that Ferdinand and Isabella were brutal religious fanatics who sparked the infamous Spanish inquisition. Second, Gregory portrays the relationship between Catherine and Henry VIII's older brother, Prince Arthur as a love affair. I suppose it is possible, but very unlikely in that time period. Gregory's purpose, of course, is the key premise of this book - that Catherine of Aragon lied when she said that her marriage to Arthur was not consummated, which means that her marriage to Henry was unlawful under church law. However, the efforts to make this point are rather forced - the romance between Arthur and Catherine reads like a nauseating dime store romance", "images": [], "asin": "0743272498", "parent_asin": "0743272498", "user_id": "AEVWJ4AZJF2I6WZ3KRAZOYHZIRAA", "timestamp": 1207180209000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A dark fantasy read that treats mental disorders with respect and reality", "text": "I'm a hit or miss fantasy reader and I rarely enjoy sci-fi, BUT Edge of the Breach was an absolute hit for me. Where I dislike the genres is within the usual flowery prose or the worlds require me as the reader to suspend too much belief in order to follow a character arc. Yeah. That didn't happen in this book.<br /><br />Halo Scot wrote in a style that I love. While the descriptions were detailed with poetic (oftentimes vulgar poetry, but still elegant poetry) phrases, the style holds a modern taste that draws me in. By using first person points of view, Scot managed to engage me with laughter as well as drawing me into the emotions one feels when dealing with mental health issues such as OCD, depression, anxiety, and autism. Scot avoided overly simplistic summaries of the reactions (from both sides of the disorders--the sufferer and the supporters). Within the fantasy world Scot created, the emotions are very real. At times, it hurt to read, but I couldn't put the book down because I cared about the characters and their pain.<br /><br />Now, about the world within Edge of the Breach. It's fantastic. I mean that. Fantasy and wonderful. The details and rules of the world held. There were no easy or obvious fixes when the story got hard. Part of why I struggle with fantasy is that there tends to be a magical shield or that last moment saving item that appears and saves the day. Scot never went for the easy within this book. Instead, the characters and world stayed in tact. What worked was only through established personalities, skills, and available resources. Nothing easily appeared. There were no cheats. That kept me guessing and at no point did I have the \"oh, I know where this is going\" moment.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I'm already a bit annoyed that the sequel has yet to be written, because I want to know what comes next. That being said, whatever time Halo Scot needs to write the sequel as well as the first book in the Rift Cycle series, it will be worth it.", "images": [], "asin": "B082MR74M1", "parent_asin": "B082MR74M1", "user_id": "AGSH7X4JX2IDPTLQO64AIJQ3EEZQ", "timestamp": 1587665964908, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not My Cup Of Tea", "text": "Though their are a few useful reminders here, I largely did not like this book.<br /><br />My perception is that the author comes to the self help/recovery/personal growth field from a strong marketing (money generating) perspective, which has always rubbed me the wrong way.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A popcorn book for the thoughtful", "text": "I have nothing but respect for Ray Kurzweil. Plowing through his \"The Singularity Is Near\" was tedious, but rewarding. Kurzweil's ideas on the merger between man and machine are provocative, The same can be said of Martine Rothblatt.<br /><br /> This not light-reading. Many would be offended by this book and its implicit rejection of certain religious beliefs. Others will simply be unable to comprehend the core concepts: conscious intelligence as a non-cellular being. A conscious being that is a machine. Human Level Artificial Intelligence. Machines that not only think, but are consciously aware and capable of what we consider \"thought\", but are not alive in the sense we understand the word.<br /><br /> BINA48 is the largely rudimentary clone of Rothblatt's real-life wife. \"Scientists, innovators, doctors, programmers and dreamers know that human consciousness is not limited to brain of cerebral neurons. IT is rapidly closing in on creating humanlike consciousness simply because of what we know about how the brain works: it isn't necessary to \"copy\" every function of the human brain in order to generate thought, intelligence and awareness\".  One example: IBM's Watson which won a \"Jeopardy\" contest against the best two human competitors.<br /><br /> Stop and ponder for a moment, as the author does. At one time, the fruit on a tree may have been beyond the grasp of our ancestors - so the brain came up with a solution. Use a stick to shake the fruit loose from the tree. Shake the tree. Throw stones. And some millions of years later (or so) you hold access to millions of pages of information in your hand in the form of a device that communicates wirelessly at the speed of light.<br /><br /> Rothblatt wants us to consider going where few other minds have gone before.<br /><br /> This is a challenging book, one to be read in leisure, with many pauses to reflect on what she has to say. The consciousness of a beloved grandparent living on and even growing forever. Or the evil mind of a tyrant able to rule for eons, a frequent topic of post-World War II comic books.<br /><br /> Mindclones, Rothblatt calls them. And she brings to mind many considerations, legal, ethical, scientific that we have not had to consider with reasoning, conscious machines.<br /><br /> Heavy stuff to be sure, but taken in small doses, very thought-provoking.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Almost the Anne Rice of Old", "text": "The last Anne Rice novel I read was her final novel featuring the brat prince Lestat, Blood Canticle.  But that novel ended on a note of frustration that I felt did a disservice to the chracter, but as they say that then and this is now.  For the most part I really enjoyed Wolf Gift.  It doesn't quite rise to the level of the Vampire Chronicles, but then will Anne Rice ever rise to that level again and does she really need to?<br /><br />Wolf Gift is still in the supernatural realm that Anne Rice does so well but with a twist and a little of the post-Lestat Anne thrown in for good measure.  Wolf Gift is not your typical werewolf story, but that's what makes it so interesting.  I quite enjoyed getting to know the protagonist Reuben and was really surprised when the story took a very superhero-like turn as Reuben struggles with his new \"gift\" and what he wants to do with it.  In fact, I found some of the vigilante action scenes to be a fun change of pace from what we normally expect from Anne Rice.<br /><br />If I had to pick a fault, and it's really why I coldn't give Wolf Gift five stars, it's the lackluster finale of the story.  Here we have a return of the Anne Rice who could get a little too preachy with her ruminations on good versus evil.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "It's easy cooking greens (apologies to Kermit :-)", "text": "One of my favorite things to buy every week is organic kale and mustard greens, but other than my standby recipe for kale chips or using it in soups, I wasn't really sure how to show it off to its best advantage. Enter Nava Atlas's \"Wild About Greens,\" which will give you 125 vegan recipes for kale, collards, mustard greens, and more.<br /><br />The journey begins with a brief guide to preparation and an illustrated who's who of greens, from common varieties (spinach, kale, chard), to those I'd looked at but didn't know how to prepare (including  Asian greens such as tatsoi and mizuna, beet greens, dandelion greens, turnip and radish greens). Thanks to Nava, I learned that you can freeze greens by blanching them and putting them into freezer bags (before, I had the bad habit of leaving them in the fridge until the end of the week when they were past their prime).<br /><br />Chapter 1 appropriately starts with basic preparations, including saut\u00e9s, braising, and stir-fries. I particularly enjoyed the Mediterranean greens with pine nuts and raisins and the chard with raisins and pecans from this chapter. Subsequent chapters focus on heartier combinations of greens and grains and/or beans, including pasta with two beans and escarole, rosemary potatoes and collard greens with vegan sausage, and ragout of broccoli rabe with white beans and porcini mushrooms.<br /><br />I was first introduced to massaged kale salads in Nava's [[ASIN:1402780052 Vegan Holiday Kitchen: More than 200 Delicious, Festive Recipes for Special Occasions]] so I was happy to see a wider variety here, including kale salad with fresh fruit and radicchio and Asian-flavored kale and napa cabbage salad. You'll find a large variety of soups utilizing greens, including the wonderful Italian-style potato and escarole soup (I added sun-dried tomatoes that I had on hand, and it really added an extra layer of texture and flavor). Finally, the recipes are rounded out by a juicing primer and such unusual flavors as beets and greens juice with apples and ginger, sparkling spinach juice, and several greens-based smoothies: spinach and mango smoothie, nutty chocolate-banana and spinach smoothie, and kale and pear smoothie.<br /><br />One small note: the text color on some of the sections is very light and there is little contrast against the background, making these recipes difficult to read from a distance. Also, there are relatively few photos if you're one of those who likes to see photos for each recipe. And finally, no nutritional info is given, which would have been appreciated.<br /><br />Verdict: \"Wild About Greens\" is a great way to make the most of bountiful seasonal/regional greens and is sure to expand your recipe repertoire. There's enough variety that you can easily cook through several weeks of recipes without a repeat, and you'll find various international influences (Italian, Asian, Mexican) to boot. This is a great primer for CSA members or anyone looking to eat more healthfully.<br /><br />(Thanks to Nava Atlas for the review copy!)", "images": [], "asin": "1402785887", "parent_asin": "1402785887", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1345113565000, "helpful_vote": 35, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "He's not a writer, and this book isn't for you", "text": "Two caveats up front. First off, Anthony Bourdain is not a writer. His prose is basic-to-mediocre, and the text is riddled with typos (although that's as much on the editors as Mr. Bourdain). The second caveat is that this book is unapologetically not for the mass public. Bourdain's real aim in writing was to be authentic to who he is as a cook, communicating with other cooks in language only they will truly understand, although along the way he tosses out some bread crumbs for the lay person. Given these starting points, this is one of the better books I've read in my life.<br /><br />Bourdain is, using the oft-repeated mantra, the Hunter S. Thompson of the cooking world. This is the gonzo journalism of the cooking industry. He's an awful person, and you can tell you'd hate working anywhere near the guy. He's crass, he's foul-mouthed, he tries to sneak in big words to look smart. You will actually hate this guy sometimes, and you'll also likely want to stay away from the restaraunts he's decribing. But then you realize. Bourdain's power as a writer lies in stirring your feelings. You feel revulsion at his life, because he tells the story with painful truth. You hate the man, because he does a very good job communicating what horrible things he's seen and done. You become squeamish about restaraunts, because you can tell the horrors are all too real.<br /><br />And yes, there's a lot of horrors found in this text. People having sex in back rooms, snorting cocain off the bar, shoveling \"unused\" bread from one table to the next, and why the Monday fish special is usually a bad idea. This is the truth of the cooking industry, warts and all.<br /><br />Or is it? As many have said, there's a big asterisk on the whole book, partially thanks to the updated edition. Bourdain has recanted a lot of the subservion found in the book. In fact, partly because of this book, you're less likely than most any point in history to be serviced by any kitchen where waiters are spitting in your food or cutting dangerous corners maximizing profit. There's more scrutiny than ever on the cooking industry, and a lot more money flowing, causing standards in today's kitchens to be much higher than at the time of writing.<br /><br />Kitchen Confidential, in some ways, is to the kitchen industry what Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" was to the meat-packing industry. The more terrifying parts of the book are now relics of a bygone era. You might say that this is what the restaraunt industry was, not necessarily what it is. And that's okay.<br /><br />So much like the works of Hunter S. Thompson or Chuck Palahniuk, this book makes you feel. Bourdain's crass writing accomplishes this goal in spades. The additional commentary from Bourdain that the new edition contains will also tell you that Kitchen Confidentail massively surpassed Bourtain's expectations in terms of being true to the cooking world and \"telling it like it is\". Will you like this book? I can't tell you that. You might hate this book. You might ignore every word, toss this paperback in the garbage, and return to restaraunt dining with nary a care in the world. Regardless, you have to admit that this book does exactly what the author intended.<br /><br />Recommended enthusiastically to anyone who has ever eaten food.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A nod to the Ravenloft books I loved so much growing up", "text": "PALADIN UNBOUND was an exciting and fast-paced break following immediately on the heels of the intense marathon read that was Dragon Mage. There are certain books that hit at just the right time and I didn't know how much I needed this story until I sat down and began reading it. Part quest fantasy, part dark adventure, with a splash of vampires and horror thrown in the mix, and this story turned out to be such a cool blend of so much of what I love in a killer read.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about this book is the fantastic worldbuilding. Evelium is very much a wondrous traditional fantasy setting but with a dark edge that hints at a tumultuous and deadly past. We get glimpses of the history of this world at the beginning of each chapter by way of snippets taken from historical texts. It's alluded to that these texts were uncovered over the years by way of excavations. I really liked this technique because it provided a valuable context to the story without it feeling like info-dumping.<br /><br />This book also deals a good deal with prejudice and stereotypes. The main character Umhra is a half-blood orc who often encounters derision and suspicion wherever he goes. Life isn't easy for he and his band of mercenaries as many jobs go to a more \"acceptable\" segment of clients. It's extremely surprising then when he is given the delicate mission of finding out what happened to a group of well-placed and respected dignitaries/soldiers who may have ventured into cursed Telsidor Keep only to then not return. Why assign this task to Umhra? Why now? Could it be because he and his cohorts are seen as expendable, or is there a deeper and more significant reason?<br /><br />Once the mission gets under way this story really takes off and becomes a breakneck dark adventure fantasy to the thrilling final page. This is a truly delightful multi-faceted story that took me places that I wasn't expecting. I think that the addition of some horror elements gave this one a very Ravenloft feel, which hearkened back to my glory days of devouring those books one after another when I was first cutting my teeth on fantasy as a genre.<br /><br />Suffice to say that Jeffrey Speight has written a wonderful first book that bodes incredibly well for future volumes. I had an absolute blast reading this and the story hit me with all the nostalgic feels that makes this such an entertaining experience from start to finish. Pick up this book if you love quick reads that grab your attention right from the jump and never let go. I can't wait to read the next book that Speight puts out because PALADIN UNBOUND, although entirely satisfying and amazing, left me wanting more of this type of story.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Blue Mustangs, Red Corvettes, and a Whole New Type of Fiction  --", "text": "In the late 1960's a new type of American literature evolved, one that spoke straight to the social and economic needs of teens and bypassed the sentimental, boy-meets-girl fiction that had largely been the norm before. THE OUTSIDERS (1967) by a new teen author, S.E. Hinton, set the outlook and established the genre. \"Young Adult\" fiction, as the new writing came to be called, was a hit with adolescents and sympathizers alike.<br /><br />The novel is set in a medium-sized Oklahoma city and narrated by \"Ponyboy\" Curtis who, along with his two older brothers, was left to fend for himself when their parents died in a car wreck. After that, material privation is only part of the challenges the brothers face. The town is divided along class lines: on the East Side live working-class \"Ponyboy,\" his family and friends, the so-called \"Greasers\"; to the West are the middle-class \"Socs,\" the better-off but not necessarily \"rich\" kids. These two mega-gangs have their own different styles, which author Hinton limns out in great detail: social interaction (Soc understatement versus Greaser passion), transportation (newer Detroit cars versus walking, or beaters), clothes (wheat jeans and Madras plaid versus t-shirts and leather), and of course music (the Beatles versus Elvis -- after all, this was 1967).<br /><br />After a long-anticipated rumble pits Greasers against Socs, Ponyboy and friends decide it's best to go into hiding in another town. But what should have been prudent develops along unanticipated and tragic lines, which I can't go into here. I can say, though, that THE OUTSIDERS put S.E. Hinton at the top of her game, gave legs to a powerful new force in fiction, and even triggered a spate of highly successful movies, not least of them the eponymous feature film (1983) starring Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise. Even if \"teen angst\" is but a long-vanished memory for most of us, THE OUTSIDERS and its ilk are well worth discovering.", "images": [], "asin": "014240733X", "parent_asin": "014240733X", "user_id": "AH4CDXZ2CADQZEXGVINPIPSBRQ4Q", "timestamp": 1625855231517, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

How our atoms slacken and slide out of tune. How they slip past one another, the slightest of friction. How they whisper insurrection. How they articulate in flame what we leave behind.&#34;<br /><br />This book was dark. Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down is about a high school in St. Louis dealing with the ramifications of a school shooting that took 28 students from them, and the impossible task that four students face in creating a yearbook that no one is going to want to read. In the wake of this disaster, the town's grief is only piled upon when the houses of the families who lost a child begin to burn to the ground. It's a &#34;story of grief, community, and family, of the search for understanding and normalcy in the wake of devastating loss, Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down explore profound questions about resiliency, memory, and recovery that brilliantly illuminate the deepest recesses of the human heart.&#34;<br /><br />That last bit makes this book sound very intense, and let me tell you it lives up to every ounce of that. There was no reprieve, no respite from the grief, from the darkness, from the fear and anxiety and tragedy that pervades every page of this book. I would be hard pressed to believe that the author, Anne Valente, had not experienced loss and tragedy of her own. She knows too intimately the feeling of it, the way it colors everything, the atmosphere it creates. She does a superb job of communicating that feeling to the reader, of putting them right in the thick of it, of using words to communicate far more than words seem they could.<br /><br />I was waiting through the whole book for a glimmer of hope; for resolution that I'm sad to say never came. Though the ending was surprising and befitting of the title, I had wished for more closure. I suppose that wishing for that is fitting and adds another layer to the reading experience. And it is just that, an experience. Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down keeps you turning pages. I don't know if it is just our own curiosity, sick as it is, to get into the minds of shooters and arsonists, but we always need to know why and I think that is the main driving force behind our need to keep reading. Very well executed, in every sense. Even down to the last two pages, which were filled with poetic introspection and comments about the human condition, which I always appreciate.<br /><br />p.s.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Through the course of the novel they meet others like themselves and try to figure out who they are", "text": "Icons by Margaret Stohl is set in a world run by aliens that have dominated humans. The majority of human race was eliminated and the remaining people are enslaved. The main character Dol and her childhood companion Ro are special in some way unknown precisely to them. Through the course of the novel they meet others like themselves and try to figure out who they are. This is of course with the backdrop of a rebellion to overthrow the alien overlords.<br /><br />This novel keeps the listeners attention and is filled with action. The characters continue to move and face more challenges as they try to figure out what is actually going on around them. My favorite characters in this novel were actually Doc and Fortis even though they are not the main characters. Doc is especially well done because of the computerized tone of his voice. The logic based speech added a lot of humor to the story.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this novel is how it is arranged. Between the main chapters of the story told from the perspective of Dol runs a third person reading of documents. These in-between readings provide the listener with clues about the story and add another layer of information. This is great because the main characters of the story are mostly unknowledgeable. With these in between readings, the listener can couple what the characters are doing and their knowledge with this additional insight. It helps the listener make their own conclusions about the events and the world.<br /><br />What I actually found to be annoying was that this is a young adult novel in which the characters are not only young as expected but also na\u00efve and behave as such. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to understand the main characters\u2019 feelings and actions. There are some incongruous aspects when characters suddenly seem to change the way they are. I didn\u2019t feel like this about the other characters.<br /><br />I believe the narrator, Therese Plummer, did a great job with the voice of the different characters. They were clearly different. I did find the main character\u2019s voice to be annoying, but I can\u2019t tell if that is because of the main character or the narrator. The emotion that Dol embodies may be the cause of my irritation toward her voice. I though the rest were great. The production was well done, especially Doc\u2019s voice the in-between readings were great.<br /><br />Audiobook provided for review by the publisher.<br /><br />Please find this complete review and many others at audiobookreviewer dot com<br /><br />[If this review helped, please press YES.

I would say that this book is not for everyone due to the portrayal of necrophelia.  Short chapters, great prose (the local language, setting, descriptions etc.) and pacing.  I simply kept wanting to read.  What next?  The subject matter is quite sad.  The 27 yr old Lester Ballard of Sevier Co., Tennessee has lost everything in his life.  His mother ran away, his father hung himself, the county auctioned off his property, the house he is squatting in burns to the ground.  His bootlegger cannot even remember where he hid his &#34;shine.  Lester ends up in the dead of winter living in a cave.  Lester is alone in the world, he cannot relate normally to other humans.  The isolation drives him mad.  He lives alone with stuffed animals and dead bodies.  He prowls the countryside.  When he comes to town for supplies he seems unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  (The chapter with the blacksmith is when you know Lester is simply in another world.)  The law has it in for him.  He's tagged as a troublemaker.  However, he does seem to be able to communicate with some of the hill people who are also rather isolated.  Perhaps all his problems began to accelerate with a severe blow to the head.  (McCarthy implies same.)  This book was written more than 40 yrs ago and it remains a powerful statement.  It is my understanding that the actor/director James Franco made a movie out of the book.  Anyway, I much enjoyed this &#34;horrible&#34; little book.
