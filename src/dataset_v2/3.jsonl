{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it \u2013 George Santayana", "text": "Stuart Maconie, author, broadcaster, journalist and commentator on cultural and social history is, by virtue of education and profession, now one of the intelligentsia. Very much a Lancashire lad (Wigan, as he reminds us) he has not lost his roots, and has a pleasing down to earth quality in his writing. Thoughtful, intelligent, warm, humorous, this also shows a lively interest in people in all their diversity.<br /><br />In the wake of last year\u2019s referendum, Maconie, like many of us, found himself musing on our divided nation. Connections between the 1930\u2019s and the present seemed to be suggesting themselves, as right wing, populist politics, divisive and suspicious of outsiders, seemed on the rise<br /><br />2016 was the 80th anniversary of the 1936 Jarrow March/Jarrow Crusade, occasioned by the closure of the single employer on which all else depended, the steelworks. Unemployment was rising in the country, and the gaps between rich and poor, South and North, were obvious. 200 men set out to march to London to deliver a petition to Parliament. Jarrow captured the public imagination, and the March has become a legend of dignity,resistance and solidarity on the one hand and uncaring capitalism on the other, a divided nation<br /><br />Maconie, a keen walker, decided to emulate the 300 mile journey made by the Marchers, following their daily itinerary, \u2018visiting the same towns and comparing the two Englands of then and now\u2019<br /><br />Some of the parallels were very clear:<br /><br />\u201cThe rise of extremism here and abroad fired by financial disasters, a wave of demagoguery and \u2018strong man\u2019 populism. Foreign wars driven by fundamentalist ideologies leading to the mass displacement of innocent people. A subsequent refugee \u2019crisis\u2019. The threat of constitutional anarchy with conflict between government, parliament and judiciary. Manufacturing industries, especially steel, facing extinction\u2026.Inflammatory rhetoric stoked by a factionalised press\u2026\u2026.A country angrily at odds with itself over its relationship to Europe, the elephant in the nation: Brexit\u2019<br /><br />This is far more than a purely personal story of one man\u2019s walk. Maconie engages with the people he meets, garners stories of then and now, recounts the history of the places he travels through,, whilst following some of his own interests, football, music \u2013 of all kinds, and finding, often conviviality and hospitality around food, reflecting the cultures who have added, across the centuries, to the rich loam of this island .<br /><br />This is an engaging, fascinating account, sometimes angry, often scathing about those whose manipulations fostered the divisions and uncertainties we now face, populists of the right and of the left. What stands out, again and again, is the richness of a culture, in this country, which has always been eclectic, fed by generations of \u2018outsiders\u2019 across the centuries, settling, marrying, having children who have feet in the history and culture of the new homeland, and influences from the old. \u2018 Britishness\u2019 develops, as it always has<br /><br />In some ways  this reminds me, in the serious things it is saying, of Joe Bagent\u2019s 2008 [[ASIN:0307339378 Deer Hunting with Jesus: Dispatches from America's Class War]], which looks at the rise of support for the Republican Party which came from those who might have been expected to find the Democrats their home.<br /><br />This is cultural and social history as I prefer it \u2013 humanly, rather than statistically explored, entertaining whilst informing.<br /><br />I was delighted to be offered this as an ARC, from the publishers via NetGalley, and thoroughly enjoyed this 300 mile walk, with no blisters, and in totally clement weather", "images": [], "asin": "1785030531", "parent_asin": "1785030531", "user_id": "AGIELHWW62QLOWY4ODQIOOZNHKPA", "timestamp": 1500572713999, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Culture Clash", "text": "A Lady Cyclist's Guide to Kashgar opens with an immediately engrossing scene. Three lady missionaries come upon a young girl in labor. Villages are afraid or unwilling to help the pregnant girl, a child herself, so the missionary ladies step in. The baby is born, the new mother dies, and the missionary ladies are led away to be charged with murder.<br /><br />At this point, I expected to love this book.<br /><br />The missionaries are Eva, our narrator; her sister Lizzie and an older woman called Millicent. The mission to Kashgar is really Millicent's project, for reasons of her own that aren't necessarily Gospel-based. Lizzie just wants to take photos and be with Millicent, and Eva wants to look after Lizzie. Since missionary work doesn't appeal to Eva, she's faking that bit. Her goals for the trip have more to do with her newfangled bicycle, and the journal she's keeping in hopes of publishing a guide for tourists traveling on these exciting new machines.<br /><br />Juxtaposed with events in Kashgar is the story of Frieda, a young woman in present day who has struggled to make her own life the opposite of her commune-dwelling, free-spirited mother's. Instead, Frieda finds herself somewhat tangled between her married lover and a new friendship with an illegal immigrant who's begun camping on her doorstep.<br /><br />I disliked Frieda, and thought her sections of the book were predictable and only served to break up the more interesting goings on in Kashgar. After dragging out Eva's naivete for most of the book, the ending rushed by in a blur, leaving the reader to piece together events from a few lines in quoted letters. In the end, I wanted the parts of the story I didn't have and was impatient with the parts that were told.", "images": [], "asin": "1608198111", "parent_asin": "1608198111", "user_id": "AEUZ2P5DA6F2IZOUOLVTHJNA3JAQ", "timestamp": 1336159643000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wise Insight Into How to Obey the Ten Commandments", "text": "Jen Wilkin has a talent for explaining ancient commandments in the Bible in everyday language. The Ten Commandments look simple on the surface, but it is easy to break them without actually meaning to. A lot of people use God's name in vain when they swear and worship other gods by giving worldly things a higher priority than God. And coveting other people's possessions and lives is a national sport.<br /><br />Jen Wilkin explains all the background before The Ten Commandments were given. Then she delves into commentary chapter by chapter, one commandment at a time. For anyone seeking to understand the full dimensions of each commandment, this is truly edifying and educational.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br /><br />How were the ten plagues in Egypt related to the gods they worshiped? (Very interesting!)<br />What is double-mindedness?<br />How can we truly rest on the Sabbath?<br />What is the real reason we should not lust or covet?<br />What should we seek to put to death in our thought life?<br />How can we honor our fellow humans?<br /><br />Jen Wilkin has an excellent intellectual grasp of the concepts in the Bible and her heart is in the right place. She combines her astounding knowledge of biblical principles with practical applications for today. Some of her thoughts are absolutely enlightening in a spiritual sense. She really gets that humans are required to honor and respect other image bearers \u2013 our fellow travelers on this earth.<br /><br />This book gives you a lot to think about and addressing issues presented will help you become more sanctified and live in God's will. Jen Wilkin provides wise insights into how Christians can obey the Ten Commandments on a daily basis. I will however say that wanting to obey is probably based on how much you love God to begin with. The more you love God the more you will want to do what he says to do. That is key!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "images": [], "asin": "1433566346", "parent_asin": "1433566346", "user_id": "AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA", "timestamp": 1614658810547, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Light Vampire Fare with a twist.", "text": "Read from November 19 to 22, 2012<br /><br />  Book Synopsis<br /><br />Mother, wife, private investigator ... and vampire. Six years ago, federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home. Then the unthinkable happened, an attack that changed her life forever. And forever is a very long time for a vampire.<br /><br />Samantha's adventures as a night-roaming vampire and private investigator in Samantha Moon include ...<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #1) Moon Dance:<br /><br />Samantha is hired by Kingsley Fulcrum to investigate the attempt on his life, a horrific scene watched on TV around the country. But Kingsley isn't exactly what he appears to be; after all, there is a reason why he survived five shots to the head.<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #2) Vampire Moon:<br /><br />Samantha Moon hunts down a powerful crime lord and protects an innocent woman from her ruthless ex-husband--all while two very different men vie for her heart. As the stakes grow higher and her cases turn personal, Samantha Moon will do whatever it takes to protect the innocent and bring two cold-blooded killers to justice--her own brand of justice.<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #3) American Vampire:<br /><br />Samantha receives a heartbreaking call from a very unlikely source: a five-year-old girl who's been missing for three months. Using her considerable resources--including her growing supernatural abilities--to locate the missing girl before it's too late, Samantha also receives devastating news on the home front, forcing her to make the ultimate choice of life and death.<br /><br />Vampire for Hire #4) Moon Child:<br /><br />Samantha Moon is faced with an impossible decision that will change her life and those of the ones she loves forever--a decision that no mother should ever have to make. And through it all, Samantha finds herself in a lethal game of vampire versus vampire as a powerful and desperate enemy will stop at nothing to claim what he most desires.<br /><br />Christmas Moon:<br /><br />With Christmas just around the corner, Samantha takes on a very strange case: A priceless family treasure has been stolen, something passed down through the generations and buried in secrets. And Samantha gets half of whatever it is ... if she can find it first.<br /><br />... and an all-new Samantha Moon short story by J.R. Rain<br /><br />  My Thoughts<br /><br />Having spent several days with Samantha Moon reading about her as she evolves over 4 short stories in the series and 2 shorter novellas has been an interesting experience.<br /><br />Samantha takes on cases ranging from investigating attempted murder, to bringing killers to justice with her own brand of retaliation, to finding a kidnapped child and breaking up what turns out to be a blood harvesting ring. Along the way her marriage breaks up, her husband refuses to allow her to be alone with her son and daughter and only limited phone contact, she then finds herself being wooed by multiple admirers and is confused by the attention more than actually flattered, she also has to deal with the sudden surge in strength of her vampire induced powers and for a woman alone who at any given moment has too many irons in the fire but manages to admirably continue to strive to be a good parent, keep her baser instincts under control as well as keep her PI investigations on track.<br /><br />This is one of those character driven reads where the reader either really enjoys the main character and their personality or is turned off by them and cannot connect. I love Samantha, she is a strong lady who is not afraid to try to make life as good as possible despite her being attacked years ago and becoming one of the undead. She loves her children fiercely and will do anything for them to keep them safe and take care of them no matter what anyone else wants. Samantha is also humorous with a sense of the macabre in her humor that lends itself well to the stories.<br /><br />The secondary characters introduced into each of the books are also fun to follow, the lawyer Kingsley Fulcrum who is her first client in book 1 is an ongoing part of the series and as one learns more about him he becomes someone you either want to hit over the head or hug depending on what scene he is in.<br /><br />Second and more interesting is Samantha's online friend Fang, when his true identity is revealed and his physical attributes are described the reader will be as delighted as Samantha!<br /><br />The 4th book in the series is the one that will break your heart and leave you speechless, Sam is forced into a decision that no Mother should ever have to face and she makes the right choice in my mind. However as with all choices there are consequences and repurcussions but in the end everything turns out fine.<br /><br />The two short novellas add to Samantha's list of persons she finds intriguing and also allow a little more insight into who she was prior to her attack and what she is slowly realizing she is becoming.<br /><br />Throughout this entire collection the reader is going to laugh, cry, sigh with disappointment, react violently to the actions taken by Sam's ex-husband Danny (who I personally would love to bludgeon with a blunt object!) and have a hard time letting go when the books are finished.<br /><br />I really wish to thank the author J.R. Rain for providing us with such an entertaining collection of stories and plan to someday continue with the rest of the series.<br /><br />  [EARC via Netgalley from BenBella books in exchange for an honest review.]", "images": [], "asin": "1937856178", "parent_asin": "1937856178", "user_id": "AGR4V67NQMGIWTESVZZYT4WMK5MA", "timestamp": 1354299408000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Probably from a comic book ad. My circle of friends did the same and we traded stamps and looked for places as far away as the imagination can travel. I religiously returned the Jamestown Stamp companies 'on consignment' mail that I didn't choose - kids love mail, they may or not completely understand the implications. My cousin didn't. He had a stellar collection. We thought he was rich. I mean he was loaded with stamps and needed the really big GALACTIC (or something) stamp collection mounting book that I could only wish I could afford with bottle return change. My younger cousin apparently failed to notice the fine print \"SEND CASH. RETURN STAMPS YOU DON'T BUY CAUSE WE'RE GONNA SUE YOU FOR THEIV'IN IF YOU DON'T\". This minor detail was beyond my younger cousin's comprehension, so he kept everything Jamestown sent him ... and they sent him a lot until one day ma gets a call that she owes like a billion $ for her son's delinquency. We were consigned to a significant increase in supervision until we were all band.<br /><br />I learned more history and geography from those years than the rest of my life. Bosnia-Herzegovina? I could spell it and knew it on the map. That lesson in philately fueled my future life to in fact visit and seek to visit those lost countries.<br /><br />The book has two kinds of lost countries. Some had affordable and plentiful over-stamped origins from WW1 & 2. I had those. Some here are serious money stamp collecting from historical and Realpolitik moments that were new to me with stamps absolutely out of price range.<br /><br />The British Guiana 1c Magenta (More Than $10M), Baden 9 Kreuzer (Approximately $1.1M) we knew those ... we were constantly on alert for them.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a fast read and not very detailed.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "One Two Three", "text": "Seventeen years ago, Belsum Chemical set up shop in Bourne and turned its water green. Since then, most of Bourne\u2019s residents have come down with or been born with health problems, including the Mitchell triplets, who refer to themselves in birth order number, which also corresponds to the number of syllables in their names. Mab, or One, is a \u201cnormal\u201d sixteen-year-old girl. She\u2019s on the track for high-achieving kids at school. Monday, or Two, is on the autism spectrum. When the town library closed, she took custody of the books, which are now crammed in every nook and cranny of their house. She knows the exact location of every single one though. Mirabel, or Three, has what appears to be cerebral palsy, although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever specifically stated. She is in a wheelchair and has the use of just one arm and hand. She uses a voice machine to communicate.<br /><br />The triplets\u2019 father, who worked in the chemical plant, died of cancer before they were born. Their mother Nora has been trying to get a class-action lawsuit going against Belsum ever since. Then one day, Nathan Templeton, the son of Belsum\u2019s founder, comes to town promising a new beginning. But can he and Belsum be trusted?<br /><br />One Two Three alternates between the first-person perspectives of the three girls. Each has a distinctive voice and their own fully developed personality. It\u2019s a heavy story but there is some humor as well. Especially from Monday, who is endearing, yet frustrating in the way that overly literal people often are. Mirabel, because she has been an observer of people for her whole life, is wise beyond her years. My favorite line from her is:<br /><br />\u201cThere are two kinds of people in this world: the ones who split the world into two kinds of people, and the ones who know that\u2019s reductive and conversationally lazy.\u201d<br /><br />I enjoyed One Two Three quite a bit. I like books that are about the people in small towns or communities pulling together to help each other out, as long as they don\u2019t get too cheesy. One Two Three certainly doesn\u2019t. If anything, it\u2019s a little on the darker side, but not in a bad way.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Second City Mayhem ...", "text": "More often than not, the city of Chicago always seems to take a back seat to all things New York and Los Angeles.  With his CITY OF SCOUNDRELS, author Gary Krist details an eerie 12-day period of time in July 1919 when the \"Second City\" almost imploded following a series of subsequent disasters.  Chock full of details and told in manner that gives readers an eye-witness perspective at street level, CITY OF SCOUNDRELS sheds light on how the nation's second largest city survived a momentary descent into the darkness of total chaos.<br /><br />Amid the sweltering heat of July in 1919, simmering tensions beneath the city's bustle and relative calm were brought to a head by a bizarre, chain-reaction of calamitous events:  an aerial disaster, the murder of a child, a massive transit strike and one of the worst race-riots in the American history.  Making matters worse, the city's leadership at the time was deeply embroiled in its own political turmoil.<br /><br />Krist takes readers on a progressive whirlwind tour of simultaneous, escalating events without losing focus in the process.  Starting with the crash/explosion of a blimp, he uses the event to segue into the fragile racial balance that has been rocked by numerous bombings.  With the blimp crash and racial issues still fresh in our minds, he introduces us to the disappearance and subsequent murder of a child that creates even more public outrage.  As these intial small crises begin to build, Krist reminds us that in the background, the city is run by a stereotypical fat-cat mayor, William \"Big Bill\" Thompson, whose political goals often come at the expense of his constituents.  Krist details the unholy matrimony that exists between Thompson and an erudite, political puppet-master, Fred Lundin, as well as their plans to use Chicago as Thompson's stepping-stone to the US Presidency.  With the fires of the blimp crash, crumbling race-relations and the nonsensical murder of a child smoldering in our minds, we are reminded of the ill-effects Prohibition was having on Chicago, as well as its struggle to recover from a war-time economy.  With all components already in place for the perfect storm, a mass transit strike occurs only to be followed by a race-related murder that sparks a one of the nation's worst race riots.  The worst case scenario has occurred and the mayor is \"asleep at the wheel.\"  As the rage within the city slowly begins to lose steam (with the unrequested assistance of the Illinois State militia), the city manages to survive the storm, but political careers are forever damaged.<br /><br />I found CITY OF SCOUNDRELS both educational and lively, mainly due to the manner in which it was written.  Gary Krist deftly outlines a wide-range of events with crisp detail (enough to generate the feeling of seeing them first-hand), but the reader never gets lost in the story.  I feel this can be attributed to the author's knack of returning to each event in a timely manner and coherently managing to tie them all together.  I was left with feeling that no story was left untold and each storyline had closure.  I also appreciate the way CITY OF SCOUNDRELS made me take an interest in a period of time that I previously felt no particular desire to explore ... the 12 days of labor that contributed to the birth of modern Chicago.", "images": [], "asin": "0307454290", "parent_asin": "0307454290", "user_id": "AGNLRIXUGGGR4E47KQDGWOG6ZGMQ", "timestamp": 1332780286000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Not only is she a \"ghost whisperer,\" she also is a bit psychic. She can sometimes feel what other people are feeling or sometimes she even knows what they're thinking. Quite a multi-talented young lady, isn't she?<br /><br />Tara and her only relative, Uncle Pat, (plus her two best friends Millicent and Henry who just happen to be ghosts) just moved to a new town. Like being the new girl isn't hard enough, it seems like Tara's new house is haunted. This thing in Tara's house is sinister-like and wont leave her alone. Tara must find out what the shadow wants before it hurts someone...Tara included.<br /><br />On top of all that, a popular girl at her new school, Bethany, suddenly goes missing. And thanks to her psychic abilities, Tara is the only one who can find Bethany. With the help of Flynn, the gorgeous bad boy from school who might or might not have feelings for Tara, Tara sets out to find Bethany before she gets seriously hurt...or even worse, killed.<br /><br />I loved this book! I thought the story itself was very interesting and entertaining...I love ghost stories and a good mystery, and this book just happened to have both rolled into one! It was great!

Kai is a normal kid, well as normal as you can be when being hunted and in a world of demons and witches, who has to learn the truth about himself and about the role his parents played in the current apocalypse. He has to discover whether good or evil will right the wrong his parents did. He is a character that you connect with right away - you are running with him to escape those chasing him, feeling good about finding a group to hang out with, fear when the demons react so strongly to him, confusion about who he really is and what he is truly capable of, etc. All of the characters are well crafted, easy to get to know and believable. Some are easily confused by power and greed, even if momentarily. The story will definitely keep you reading.<br /><br />I had put this book down for a month because of a crazy busy life and when I picked it back up I easily slid back into the story and where it was going.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Decent for beginners but some incorrect info, and author's own sites are lacking", "text": "I am a web designer who has done work for Fortune 1000, non-profs, and govt, but I have little experience with small e-commerce sites, so I thought this book might be helpful.<br /><br />This book is written at a *very* basic level, a small step up from explaining what a website or search engine is. Much of it is common sense, but there are some pretty good points that not everyone will know. So on that level, I think its good for beginners who have no experience with web development or even how to run a business.<br /><br />What concerned me was that because the author is not actually in the field of web development, he seems to just \"improvise\" some info. This book contains some incorrect information and there are some issues with the author's own websites.<br />-The author's websites should be models of well designed e-commerce sites. They are \"fine\" and functional, but there are some design and usability issues. forcopywritersonly.com does not look professionally designed, has some basic usability issues such as lack of breadcrumbs, nav states not staying on at the tertiary level, an inconsistent use of text links and button links, blog missing most common blog functionality, use of the word \"click here\" which is seen as a big faux pas in the industry, etc. I just showed my girlfriend forgraphicdesignersonly.com (his second site), and told her the guy on the homepage says he is a graphic designer. Her response was, \"Are you f-ing kidding me?\" It doesnt look professional at all despite the author saying he is a \"Registered Graphic Designer\" (NEVER heard of such a thing).<br />-He defines terms he says are common in the industry that just arent. \"Beta site\" is a not a demo site used by designers, it is a site used for web applications before they are done. I have never heard a designer use that term. We might call them staging sites or testing sites. We don't use the term \"masthead\". The author must be thinking of magazines. We call them headers or banners. On page 105, he says, \"This is tricky because most internet web browsers, like Foxfire..\" The author must be thinking of Firefox. Typo perhaps, but at the level this book is written, one assumes the readers havent heard of these different web browsers.<br />-He mentions applications or services that are not common or forgets some common ones. For example, he says Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression are \"used by most professional designers\". Dreamweaver, yes. The second I have never seen used ever (and I have worked lots of places). When he mentions email marketing software, he forgets the number one most popular, MagnetMail (and yes, it was big at time of publication too).<br />-When talking about web development, he only talks about web design, the word information architecture never appears and that is a big part of it too.<br />-His lists of websites to consult or applications to use that exist throughout the book are deceptively long. Usually the first couple are commonly used and the next 12 or seem to be just the result of the author doing a web search and entering the results into his book w/o actually knowing anything about them.<br /><br />Anyway, again, I wouldnt completely discount this book because it has some pointers on promoting your business and such, but there have to be other books out there written by professionals in the industry (people who work at reputable web development or PR firms) who really know what they are talking about.", "images": [], "asin": "1592578896", "parent_asin": "1592578896", "user_id": "AEJS6MM4HBJ4ZYHVZML6KTSDB46Q", "timestamp": 1304203420000, "helpful_vote": 82, "verified_purchase": true}

He was a Marine and still mourns the loss of his team in a mission that went sideways. Now he's a reaper, bringing the guilty and sadistic to justice.<br /><br />Naomi 'Mimi' Lyla Peters was a drug addict that fell into the clutches of evil men that used and abused her in unspeakable ways. She should be dead but the Royal Bastards saved her. Mimi has to recover her self worth and learn how to live and trust again.<br /><br />The Bloody Scorpions and the Russians from the Black Market Railroad want her dead.  That's okay, Patriot and the club want them dead too.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic series starter for fans of fantasy - YA OR adult!", "text": "This book was my first ever Schwab read, and I went into it a little bit apprehensive, because she is so widely loved that I wondered if this series would live up to the expectations I had for it. I picked it up for the Life & Lit June group read, and ended up putting it off until the last possible minute because I was so wary, but my nervousness was entirely unfounded. This book was phenomenal!<br /><br />KELL \u27b3\u27b3<br />What can I even say? Kell is one of the most lovable male MCs I\u2019ve seen in a really long time. He\u2019s so loving and protective, despite his ongoing self-identity crises regarding his family. He loves his brother Rhy with a fierceness that I couldn\u2019t get enough of, and he\u2019s just so genuinely good in his heart that I couldn\u2019t help but root for him. He\u2019s one of those MCs that makes me afraid to continue the series because I can\u2019t handle anything terrible happening to him.<br /><br />LILA \u27b3\u27b3<br />I didn\u2019t really know what to make of Lila at first, because to be frank, her excuses for thievery kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Like\u2026 you\u2019re just going to steal from all of these people because you can? I wouldn\u2019t have minded so much if she just stole food or whatever, but trinkets? (I revisited this annoyance a few times later in the book, too.) Overall, though, I really enjoyed her sassy attitude and the way she refused to let anyone tell her what to do or hold her down. I loved that she insisted on going on an adventure, even if it meant risking her life, and her interactions with Kell were just adorable.<br /><br />RHY \u27b3\u27b3<br />Adorable. Absolutely adorable. He actually made me cry a few times because he just is so pure and innocent and golden.<br /><br />HOLLAND \u27b3\u27b3<br />Holland honestly gave me the sketchiest vibes ever from the beginning, but I think he\u2019s a fantastic character and I pitied him more often than not. I know some stuff went down, but I really hope we get to learn more about him later in the series.<br /><br />PLOT & WORLD \u27b3\u27b3<br />I thought the plot, as well as the world-building, were absolutely incredible. I loved the idea of these parallel cities that the Antari could travel between, and I thought the magic system was beautifully built up. Too many books ignore the foundation for their magic systems and you\u2019re kind of left just going, \u201coh, well, it\u2019s magic and that\u2019s that,\u201d but Schwab didn\u2019t do that at all in this book. The idea of these Antari being sort of the chosen ones who could control blood was just really cool, and I really hope that Kell and Holland aren\u2019t actually the only ones left.<br /><br />WRITING \u27b3\u27b3<br />Like I said, this was my first time ever reading anything by Victoria Schwab, so I had no idea what to expect. My very first impression from the opening segment,<br /><br />&#34;Kell wore a very peculiar coat.<br />It had neither one side, which would be conventional, nor two, which would be unexpected, but several, which was, of course, impossible.&#34;<br /><br />was that her writing reminded me a great deal of Tolkien, circa The Hobbit. As I got further into the book, I did find that Victoria\u2019s voice is very much her own, but I enjoyed it to no end. It was the perfect balance of straightforward and flowery prose, and it painted a splendid picture while never wasting too much time on the details.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT \u27b3\u27b3<br />Overall, I thought this book was a fantastic beginning to a series and I cannot wait to continue with book #2. I gave this an easy 5/5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who likes three-dimensional high fantasy read, full of a delightful set of characters and a terrifically intriguing world.", "images": [], "asin": "0765399113", "parent_asin": "0765399113", "user_id": "AGUBMV3R2DG7GLZYVWKZMZPGRUSA", "timestamp": 1510068690744, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": true}

Frankie is the eldest sister and has all of the material things that she could possibly want; it's her love life that's lacking.  Having no success meeting men in any of the conventional ways, she resorts to seeking love over the Internet.  What follows is a series of disappointing dates, leaving Frankie to wonder if she will ever find her soulmate.<br />Livvy, the middle sister, is dealing with the infidelity of her husband--and the possible lifelong ramifications from the affair.  Angry, she turns to the Internet looking for answers, and finds a man whose wife has also betrayed him.  The result is a hot, torrid affair with someone who appears to be wonderful.  But things are never as they seem......<br />Tommie is the youngest sister, who continues to recover from an abusive relationship--and she has the physical scars to prove it.  Celibate for two years, she cannot deny the attraction she feels for her neighbor, Blue--who is also 16 years her senior, with a young child and plenty of baby momma drama.  Not to mention the fact that he is one of sister Frankie's tenants.....<br />There's plenty of action in this latest EJD addition.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A True Classic in the YA Genre", "text": "There aren't many people out there who haven't read Lois Lowry's classic, The Giver, but I happened to be one of them. Then I talked to my longtime friend (since 2nd grade!) who I often share great YA titles with (and a love for cheesy RomComs) and she told me The Giver was a book that she read in middle school that stayed with her. She still thought about the book 20 years later (god we are getting old). So, I decided I had to quit being a turd and do my YA collection justice with this 1994 Newberry winner. After finishing it in one voracious sitting, I had to ask myself if I would ever learn. I avoided Percy Jackson for years- did I learn? I refused to read Harry Potter, Twilight, and so many more for no other reason than they were popular. Now The Giver. Will I ever learn?! Why do I deprive myself of great stories?<br /><br />The story begins in a utopia. No one feels pain, no one is unhappy. Any feelings of anger, jealousy or concern are to be voiced in family units every morning in order to address and release them. Children are not born and raised with their parents. Instead, a sensible couple the community puts together is allowed to ask for children and they can receive up to one boy and one girl. Only Birth Mothers are allowed to have children, but since all the community members take drugs to inhibit sexual impulses from the time they reach puberty, no one seems to object. When people get too old, they are \"Released\" into a better state. If twins are born, the smaller of the two will be released. Even careers are not chosen, but rather given to the people of the community by the Elders after careful consideration. When children reach their twelfth year, they are assigned a career to focus on. Although they can request a career change, it doesn't happen. Instead, people are content in the community. They contribute, they live, and they are content. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br /><br />When Jonas reaches his twelfth year and is assigned, however, it changes everything. Jonas is assigned as the new Receiver of Memory. He is to report to the Giver of Memory, an old man who was chosen as Jonas was chosen, to be given the memories of times forgotten. This includes happy memories, like snow, sledding, warm sun, and fun. It also includes bad memories like pain, breaking an arm, war, and anger. These memories begin to change Jonas, but he is forbidden to share them with others. All he wants to do is show his sister and his friends the colors of the world, the sunshine.<br /><br />When his father, a Nurturer in the nursery, brings home a baby who isn't sleeping well, Jonas takes him into his bedroom at night and shares the happy memories with him. This soothes the baby, but is strictly forbidden, of course. Jonas and the Giver begin talking about leaving the community in order to give the people back the memories of past times, good and bad. It will be traumatic for them, but The Giver will be there to guide them. When Jonas's father announces the baby is going to be \"released\", Jonas, who has seen what \"releasing\" really is, refuses to leave the baby to that fate.<br /><br />This story is one that will truly rock your world. With so many dystopias swirling around out there, it is hard to imagine one that could sweep you off your feet as easily as this one. Nevertheless, this classic bested me. It makes the reader question their wants, their desires, their hopes. It keeps the reader on their toes and examines what is really important in life. Do we need a life free of pain and suffering? Or will that lead to the loss of all this beautiful, wonderful, and sublime as well. Do we need to experience pain in order to truly know love and happiness when we have it?<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone who hasn't read it already. Recently a coworker said she was using it in her middle school Lit class, and I was thrilled! (eerily she told me about using it in her classroom the very same day I finished reading it!) To hand this story over to students, especially in a student-driven setting, means opening the door to struggling readers who can't get enough of a story. This will be that story- it will have them questioning everything they have ever known, and then some. And isn't that why we read anyway? To question ourselves, our worlds, what we know, what we think we want to know, and so much more? Don't be afraid to give this story to your children or students- like my grade school friend, they will never forget it!", "images": [], "asin": "0395645662", "parent_asin": "0395645662", "user_id": "AGQLIVRC4THQRBQB2UG2V4WYCJQA", "timestamp": 1364042741000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing true story", "text": "I enjoyed this sequel to Caroline Jessop's autobiography , Escape. This book tells of her difficult life after leaving the FLDS and her abusive husband Merril Jessop. Caroline worked very hard to provide for her eight children, and acclimatize them to normal life outside The Church. Her eldest daughter Betty wanted to return to her father and eventually did so and refuted Caroline's statements. Caroline became a political consultant on this sect, especially  during the raid of the YFZ ranch in Texas where the group had built a new temple. She also spoke out against Warren Jeffs who had taken over as the living Prophet of the sect. Her ex-husband Merril sued for custody which he lost and also owed thousands in child support which he did not pay. He was  imprisoned with Jeffs for his crimes. Caroline is an amazingly strong selfless woman who sought a better life for her own children and all the victims of the sect. She eventually found a true romance and a man who could properly love her children. She richly deserves a happy life.This is an excellent book both on a personal level but about the FLDS as well.", "images": [], "asin": "0307590704", "parent_asin": "0307590704", "user_id": "AH2NAP3EGXV6ZICWTIVNPVCGM3IQ", "timestamp": 1420415391000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

Dostoyevsky argues that it is more important for man to have personality and be seen as an individual, and that he will even choose to suffer rather than be seen as just a part of the collective.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a story illustrating his philosophy, using as his protagonist a poor, unremarkable, and rather unlikeable man desperate to stand out, to be seen.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED: I liked the overall message of the book.

But I took a chance and because all my other choices on Vine were exhausted.<br /><br />I really tried to like this book but I could already tell it was going to be trouble from the first chapter.  The book's first person narrative left too many 'like's in sentences that whenever I passed over the word (even if it was used in a proper way), it really made me stop and grit my teeth.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem was that I could never get immersed in it.  I never believed any of the characters or liked any of them.  They all talk exactly the same way trying to be witty, and the book features a wide array of characters (18 year old boys and girls, 20-something gay guys, old gay guy, fathers, mothers).  It just made it very hard to distinguish anything.<br /><br />I do commend certain vignettes the author had taken, deciding to talk about homosexuality in good ways, tackle sex and abortion issues, the fact that college might not be for everyone, and that reality doesn't necessarily have all the magical moments in movies (even though this book certainly picks and chooses which ones it wants to have).  These issues were still done I think relatively immaturely and it tries a bit too much to be Sex and the City but the tween version.<br /><br />All in all, not for me.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Making a Film or Video? Make It \"Sticky\" with \"Lean Forward Moments\"", "text": "Humans love stories. We'll stop what we're doing to be an audience for a good story.  But what makes a story good?  Norman Hollyn offers some important clues for making a story come alive on the screen - whether it's a theater screen or a small netbook screen.<br /><br />Hollyn teaches his readers to focus on details, the details that make the difference between a good story and a big yawn.  How can a film show character, conflict, emotion, with more than just words?  Hollyn shows how he does it, how the great directors have done it.  He illustrates how the smallest detail can reinforce or destroy the mood of the story the videographer is attempting to create.<br /><br />Where are these details?  They appear throughout the entire process,<br /><br /> in the logline,<br /> the writing,<br /> the background and other production elements,<br /> the directing and cinematography, and<br /> the editing.<br /><br />Maybe, although you've seen great films all your life, you've not been aware of the tiny (and not so tiny) details that lead you to a specific emotional state.  Hollyn brings these details into your awareness and shows you how they work together to create a great story.<br /><br />So how do his lessons apply in the chaotic world of video where creation and uploading can happen with hours, even minutes?  Making videos people want to watch, want to learn from is a matter of careful planning and attention to detail of storyline, theme. and mood.  Most of the videos that languish unappreciated lack his focus and attention, lack a clear direction with cinematic elements that support rather than distract from the message.<br /><br />After reading this book, slowly savoring it, I will never again watch a film without at least minimal awareness of the cinematic elements used to create and reinforce a mood, and to draw me to the edge of my seat with a \"lean forward moment.\" And, after reading it, I've got a much better idea of how to create videos with \"lean forward moments.\"<br /><br />Highly recommended  - this book has a permanent spot in my library", "images": [], "asin": "0321585453", "parent_asin": "0321585453", "user_id": "AGMVZOQA2BL3IFNIKW76523RM6ZQ", "timestamp": 1235256144000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

She had a loving father who died when she was young, leaving her to a mean step-mother that didn't want her. She fell in love with her bestfriend's brother, Nate and thought she would finally have her happy family but when he broke up with her she ran away with Cliff, a famous chef. They married but life was anything but easy as Cliff was a serial cheater and lived for the limelight which she hated. A year after divorcing Cliff, she watches the devastating news that he was killed in a car accident and that a pregnant young woman was with him.<br /><br />Ashley grew up with a \"dad\" she adored who passed away. She and her mom work hard to make ends meet but when her mom gets deathly ill, she reveals who Ashley's real dad is.

She wakes up in a hospital and Cliff's ex-wife is there to whisk her away from the cameras and media. She is stunned by the generosity.<br /><br />Mel is hurt and angry when her bestfriend breaks her twin brother's heart and leaves town.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "super cute", "text": "i read this book in one sitting - i really enjoyed it. i went into it no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. warning, a bit spoilery!<br /><br />i agree with another reviewer that the summary gives away too much - i'm glad i read it when i requested the book and promptly forgot the details except for sports romance with a breakup and previous one night stand. because if i'd read the summary again right before i read the book, i would have been annoyed and bored, knowing what was coming. as it was, i was shocked when appropriate.<br /><br />it was funny and sexy, though a little bit oddly paced. the Chris thing stretches out a bit longer than I'd like at the beginning, I really couldn't wrap my head around why Marlee was with him when he treated her so bad. Then that blows up and Gavin comes along. I expected more of a chase or the 'wait I'm not ready for a relationship', even though a bit of time passes it does seem a bit soon after getting out of a long term relationship. yes, i realise this is a problem later on and why she does what she does, i guess i thought it was odd that's all. Also, the end with chris was unnecessary and unrealistic.<br /><br />Continuing on with the pacing thing, it didn't flow as well as I would have liked. weeks/months go by in a sentence and I'm like, wait, slow down. I think we missed some of the fun falling in love stuff, which sucked. There were a lot of conflicts, possibly too many. The mean girls got a bit old. I think Madison could have been enough, though the whole Courtney thing was funny at the beginning, but the sister too and the southern girl that is nice in the beginning... It was just a lot. I don't know.<br /><br />I loved Brynn and Naomi of course. They were fantastic side characters. The hashtags got old super fast. I thought it was funny at first but then just became grating. Especially at really dramatic points - 'he made this huge decision without telling me' #personalfoul. like wtf? i tried to ignore them but they just stood out. They might have been less annoying if there weren't so many, or weren't used when they shouldn't have been.<br /><br />Gavin was fantastic and amazing. The thing he does at the end seemed a little out of character if I'm being honest, not consistent with what we'd seen so far. That was a bit of a bummer. Other than that, I adored him.<br /><br />Marlee was a fabulous character as well. They were both really realistic and well developed. Now all this complaining and it sounds like I hated it - not at all! I really debated on giving it 5 stars but the things I mentioned above are what knocked it to a 4 star for me. But it had a lot going for it. As I mentioned, I loved all the characters. The writing was overall very good. I laughed several times and it was adorable with the right dash of sexy.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Full of tasty oatmeal recipes!", "text": "I first heard about Jenny Grothe in a recent issue of _Muscle and Fitness Hers_ magazine, where she had written an article with several really good recipes in it.  The byline mentioned her book, but when I came here to Amazon to order it, I was a bit reluctant to do so at first since many of the reviewers only have one review -- which always makes me a bit nervous since when I notice this, I worry that the reviewers are friends of the author.  I decided to take the plunge anyways, and am glad I did.  This book has over 75 recipes for oatmeal in it, and all are delicious.<br /><br />I love oatmeal so this book was right up my alley, but it has such tasty recipes in it that I can see non-oatmeal-lovers enjoying it, too.  Most of the recipes focus on baked oatmeals, but there are also a few recipes for pancakes and bars thrown in, as well as recipes that call for other grains such as quinoa and muesli.<br /><br />To give you an idea of what the recipes involve, they include ones like Black Forest Backed Oatmeal, Cinnamon Chocolate Chip Baked Oatmeal, and Key Lime Baked Oatmeal.  The variety of recipes really does cover every palette, and they mostly call for simple ingredients that one might already have on hand or that are easy to find.<br /><br />The prep time for each baked oatmeal recipe is minimal (less than five minutes), and each requires about 30 minutes of baking time.<br /><br />I like, too, how this book starts with Jenny's own story of weight loss; it's very inspirational and motivating, and Jenny seems very sweet.<br /><br />Also, although this book is small, almost every recipe has a full-color photograph, which I enjoy seeing in cookbooks.  (The book might even be self-published and could have benefited from an editor to help catch typos, but those don't bother me since the recipes themselves are so good.)  Overall, this is a great book to add to one's clean-eating collection!  I hope she writes another cookbook soon!<br /><br />UPDATE ON 7/30/11: I ordered this larger-sized ramekin [[ASIN:B00080QKKQ CorningWare French White 24-Ounce Round Dish]] and it works perfectly for all these recipes. The plastic lid also makes storing leftover baked oatmeals a breeze.<br /><br />Although Amazon does carry a sampler pack of some sugar-free Torani syrups, they weren't the flavors that were most called for by this book. I ended up picking up a few at my local World Market, but then ordered more on the Torani website since they have so many flavors on their website that are hard to find in stores.<br /><br />Every recipe I've made from this book has turned out to be incredibly delicious -- so much so that I was joking to my husband that I might start eating baked oatmeal as my three main meals each day!", "images": [], "asin": "1936631024", "parent_asin": "1936631024", "user_id": "AHTB5CKO4MLRDSVGCUDRNJ2B62EQ", "timestamp": 1311032826000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

In fact, it may be that everything you ever need to know about CVS is in this book.  This book covers version control basics, paradigm differences, branches, merging, and all of the 'basic' version control tools.  It then provides 'recipes' (boiler plate) for common operations to simplify things.  This book has perhaps two shortcomings: first, it doesn't cover all of the features of CVS.  The authors can be forgiven for stating their prejudices, particularly since they coincide with mine, but I think completeness is worth something so ignoring the features that are deemed of less worth is probably not the best. Second, this book doesn't cover the GUI interfaces.  The GUI's should be easy to figure out, and the command line is certainly where it's at for scripting, but I think there are a lot of folks who would like at least a WinCVS appendix.

The Password to Larkspur Lane takes us back in time to an era when carrier pigeons and telegraphs still existed for communication, touring cars and roadsters could be seen on country lanes, doctors prescribed linament, women wore frocks and silk stockings, and men wore spats.<br /><br />  I love the way the story unfolds visually, almost like watching a movie.  In the beginning we see Nancy in the garden picking larkspurs for a flower show.  Later we picture her in her maroon roadster with the family's temporary maid, Effie, trying to follow the flight of a passenger pigeon and still later with her friend, Helen, searching for the mysterious Larkspur Lane.  We watch her with Ned at Sylvan Lake and at a dance at the yacht club.<br /><br />  For the adventurous, this book has plenty of heart-thumping danger for Nancy at the old sanitorium, where she must try to rescue an elderly woman being held against her will by an evil Dr. Bull and his associates.  With courage, tenacity and intelligence (and the help of her friend, Helen) Miss Drew risks her life for all of the women who have been conned by the con artists.  Her  determination to thwart these villanous, greedy people and bring them to justice makes this a truly satisfying book.", "images": [], "asin": "1557091641", "parent_asin": "1557091641", "user_id": "AGKBIXKD7ZXXMNIESU6A4642VCMA", "timestamp": 1264454101000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Some good observations", "text": "Every now and again, there is something that I read that takes me back to the awkward balancing act that was high school and how much stress it was. The older you get, the memories fade and then you read something and it brings it back. When it was precise, that was the feeling that I got while reading Lindsey Lee Johnson's &#34;The Most Dangerous Place on Earth&#34; in that sense that actions, both careless and thoughtful, can have big repercussions.<br /><br />The story takes place in a well-to-do town in California. It begins with eighth grade and we meet the students who who will make up the cast : Cally, Emma, Ryan, Abigail, Damon, Nick, Dave, Elizabeth and one more. It establishes their social world both in school and on social media. Social media being a point of connection and as a source of stress.<br /><br />Then it goes to high school and their junior year. The group is older and in varying degrees, separated and together. Their lives intersect and diverge as is the way of high school. There is a new teacher, Molly, who becomes interested in her students that functions as a catalyst to observe  and follow their stories over their junior and senior years.<br /><br />As noted, when the story is good, it hits that uncomfortable spot of remembering the social stress of adolescence. The writer also seems to know the terrain of where the story takes place as the details have an authentic vibe. For me, it was cruising to a 4 star until it just started to load up on every single possible pitfall that a young person could fall into. Suicide, car accident, bullying, cheating, pedophile teacher, and so on. It lays it on thick which pushes it into soap opera rather than keen observation.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This book is so thoughtfully put together!", "text": "This book is so thoughtfully put together!<br />Now, I have to admit that I get nervous when it comes to books about \"meditation\" because they can get...well, a bit more out there then I'm interested in. But mindful meditation is such a different thing to me and I've found it so helpful. So I was really happy about this easy to follow book.<br />Each day has it's own short section, so it doesn't feel too overwhelming to tackle, but there are also some powerful questions to go over to help reflect on the new thing I tried that day.<br />For example, one part says to set a reminder to do mindful meditation 3 times a day and instantly I said \"no way!!\", but, I kept reading, and the way she broke the exercise down into these very short segments, it suddenly became something that was more manageable and very possible even on busy days.<br />It also makes you ask yourself the perfect questions for that particular exercise....some practice items I'd see and think \"well duh!\", but then, once I stopped and thought about it, I realized that I don't typically TRULY ask myself, or give myself permission to take the time for, some of these seemingly simple things, let alone take action to do anything positive about it. It seems easy but if you're really digging in, it's not that easy at first. But, say, on a subject that is a bit more difficult or intense for me personally (like all of chapter 2 and day 40 \ud83d\ude0a ), I've been able to go even slower and take it small step by small step to get through it and came out with some new ways to help me deal with some of these issues in a positive way and I really appreciate that more then I can put into words here!<br /><br />I'm told that in the printed copy of the book there are open blank spots by the reflection questions and other places, so you can have your notes right in the book which is awesome! But even if you get the Ebook, she has pages set up that have those questions on them. There is a link I clicked on right in the book at the end of the 'Commit to Yourself\" section, right before day 1 begins. They are laid out really nicely and you can download them and print them out to have them for all your notes as well.<br /><br />This book has been SO helpful to me and I am really enjoying putting it all to use.", "images": [], "asin": "1631610821", "parent_asin": "1631610821", "user_id": "AHMLLSWYPRTNNLTPE6YQPP53T4IA", "timestamp": 1609024966557, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantasy+permaculture+sci-fi+romance+excellent writing+addictive plot+dystopia=1 perfect book!", "text": "I give this book 10 out of 10 acorns! I seriously LOVE so much about this book! Let me count the ways...<br /><br />(1) The characters are realistic: They are all complex and they don't fit into molds. Sometimes I wanted them to be perfect (you know how you sometimes scream at characters \"No, don't do that! Can't you tell that's a really stupid decision?!?!\"), but the decisions these characters make fit with their histories and personalities and experiences. They don't do something just to make the book work out (you know how sometimes in a book, a character will do something totally out-of-character, just to further the plot? That doesn't happen in this book). The \"villains\" are also very well fleshed out and very realistic--you really get a feel for how and why they \"tick.\"<br /><br />(2) The world is well-thought out: I'm a big fantasy and science fiction reader. I love both genres, and this book has them both! Inside the biodome is very much like a medieval fantasy--indeed, they're Live Action Role Players that have been role playing for 20 years, and raised their kids to know no other reality! Outside of the biodome is the science-fiction. Writing sci-fi, especially sci-fi that takes place in the near-future, is really hard. Who hasn't read a scifi book written in the 70s and found the characters using big floppy disks or other outdated technology...or seen everyone flying in outerspace in the year 2000...when obviously we aren't doing that. Yet, Jesikah's world feels very real, sometimes disturbingly so in a dystopian way.<br /><br />(3) There's permaculture! To make the biodome sustainable without any outside interventions or inputs, the people inside the biodome use permaculture. I really loved the thought exercise of how permaculture works in that kind of system. There's also some thought-provoking commentary about environmentalism. This book really got my imagination, as well as my philosophical brain, working!<br /><br />(4) I very much love that there doesn't seem to be any occurrences, people, or things that occur SIMPLY to further the plot. Those kind of things drive me NUTS in a book. There's also no inconsistencies, that I can recall from my multople re-readings. I've read many a book series where, halfway through the series, the author seemingly forgets how old a character is, what their background is or what color their hair is, or how they're related to someone, or how a bit of technology works. The facts change, and your stuck there wondering which one is the right one.<br /><br />(5) The book--and series--is quite the page turner. I will admit to  having totally abandoned all my permies moderator responsibilities when I got my books...and having deprived my self of sleep to read \"one more chapter.\" (We all know how that goes, right? :D)<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this book and this series. It's like the author reached in my brain, saw my love of sci-fi, fantasy, permaculture, dystopian fiction, romance, realistic characters, and consistent writing and addictive plots, and took all those things and put them into a book. I'm pretty sure she somehow channeled me into Willow, because I could totally see myself doing and feeling as she did.<br /><br />On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being, \"you can pry this book from my cold, dead fingers,\" this book gets a 10!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "One Of The Best New 52 Relaunches", "text": "Reprints Aquaman (2011 ongoing series) #s 1-6.  To be honest, when I first started reading this book, I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but it won me over fairly quickly.  Aquaman Volume 1: The Trench introduces the post-Flashpoint Aquaman, and as with a number of other DC titles launched that first month of the New 52 era, an awful lot of previous Aquaman canon was severely altered or even eliminated.  So we're starting this corner of the DC Universe on a pretty fresh page.  The existence of Aquaman has been known to the public for six years--much shorter than in the pre-Flashpoint continuity--and he seems to have gone public as a superhero about five years ago.  (DC shrank the amount of time most of its central characters had been around, and also made nearly all of the lead characters look younger.)  So how is Aquaman at the beginning of this new era?  Well, it seems this charter member of the Justice League, lord of the seas, fierce fighter against evil, one of the more powerful super-beings on the planet is....an object of widespread public ridicule?<br /><br />It seems DC has decided to respond to the naysayers (who I always ignored) who derided the character--\"He's only there in case the Justice League needs to talk to a fish\" and so on--by incorporating that sentiment into the world the character lives in.  And if you've found the jokes at the Lord Of The Seven Seas's expense over the years irritating, you can only imagine how peeved Aquaman himself is about it.  Early on Aquaman arrives on the scene of what appears to be a bank heist and puts a quick end to it before lives are put at risk...but not before being laughed at by the criminals he's about to stop.  Then he's met with skepticism by the police he helped.  This public sentiment about Aquaman isn't universal, but it's quite widespread.  I didn't think this would work; it does though.  As readers we see Aquaman as he really is, a top tier superhuman champion with a volatile temper he only barely holds in check.  Many others see him differently.  Early on thete's an air to the book that sooner or later something's going to happen, or Arthur's going to let his temper slip, and MAKE everybody stop laughing at him.<br /><br />Even with having to put up with all of this, Aquaman's still got it pretty good.  He's taken a leave of the ocean and Atlantis to try and make a life for himself on the surface world he grew up in, and he's got Mera with him.  The press calls her Aquawoman; she appears to hate that name.<br /><br />Troubles with public perception are going to be the least of the pair's worries though.  Deep under the Atlantic Ocean, a long-sealed trench has opened up, and out come a horde of vicious semi-humanoid amphibious creatures (fantastic art on these) ravenous for food, including human meat.  They swarm into the coastal town of Beachrock, a community close to the lighthouse Arthur and Mera are now using as a home.  The battle takes place both on land and in and beneath the ocean, and the pair is left to make some very tough decisions very quickly.  This is a consistent theme with the New 52 books: the heroes can't always save everybody, and the right thing to do is not always clear.  What is clear is that this is a great launch into Aquaman's corner of the New 52 DC Universe.  Recommended for both Aquaman fans and readers who've never read an issue of his, and all readers in between.", "images": [], "asin": "140123710X", "parent_asin": "140123710X", "user_id": "AEB6TCHFKPKDH3EYX432TEDM7VWQ", "timestamp": 1676918804791, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Lost and Never Found", "text": "The Dragon Round by Stephen S. Power is a book with a beautiful cover that unfortunately never delivers. The writing and plot meandered so much and ended up tripping over itself. We had one series of confrontations after another with a revenge-stricken Captain in Jeryon that had the strategic foresight of a newborn baby.<br /><br />The Dragon Round is the story of Jeryon, a Captain whose crew abandons him alone in the middle of nowhere to die, committing mutiny. The only thing that drives him is revenge. When he, and the healer that was given a \u2018Captain\u2019s Chance\u2019 somehow manage to stumble upon a nest of dragon\u2019s eggs, he knows he finally has his vehicle for revenge against all those that wronged him.<br /><br />I had a difficult time finishing this story. I almost gave up several times, in fact, it took me around 2 weeks just to finish this book. I hated the writing style. I hated how Jeryon was pretty much an evil guy that was portrayed as a victim. What he did, the people he attacked, those were not the actions of an innocent man wronged. When I first read this I was thinking I would get something akin to The Count of Monte Cristo. Unfortunately, this book cannot even tie the shoes of that masterpiece. For this book to improve, the story needs to flow better. It jumped around so much and the writing style was a confusing mix of changing perspectives and tenses. Furthermore, the way that Jeryon treats the dragon is downright dreadful, and no way to inspire loyalty. I would not recommend this book and hope that prior to releasing some of the flow and character issues can be cleaned up. I am giving this book 2/5 flames for an almost frozen-solid plot with flat characters that never really have a chance to develop.<br /><br />I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "1501133209", "parent_asin": "1501133209", "user_id": "AG5IJUHNFPIJTPTLALKCL465NHRQ", "timestamp": 1471484339000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A great suspenseful and paranormal read you won't be able to put down!", "text": "Dark Passage is a gripping story and I finished it in one day! The story felt magnetic and I could not stop reading it! It is told from several different point of views and that was confusing to me at first, because I didn't know we had changed to a different character's POV. For future books, I think putting the character's name at the top of the page would help clear up that confusion. I really appreciated the different views from each character though, it really helped to round out the story.<br /><br />Dark Passage is ultimately about good versus evil. A great battle is looming between the two sides. Which side will each character choose? This gripping story will have you uptight and maybe a bit anxious, until you finish the book! Will Jen be united with her soul mate and will good ultimately win over evil? The dark parts of this book were a bit dark for my taste. Reading about certain ritual sacrifices for the evil side were hard for me to stomach. However, they were not too descriptive, I am just more sensitive to violence than some people. That said, I was totally dumbfounded when the author dropped the \"f-bomb\" in the middle of the book. I felt it was completely out of place and not necessary to the story.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Another fascinating sojourn in the Punktown universe", "text": "Jeffrey Thomas' Blue War is a highly enjoyable novel that is hard to categorize as it blends a number of sub-genres into a thoroughly engaging whole. Being another of Thomas' Punktown stories, it has the urban-punk feel familiar to readers of China Mieville and William Gibson. And with the return of Jeremy Stake, the chameleon-like war veteran turned private investigator of his previous novel Deadstock, it has the gritty detective feel of Dashiell Hammet in a sci-fi setting. Add in a dose of a Michael Crichton cautionary techno-tale and you'll approach what there is to find in Blue War.<br /><br />Chronologically, Blue War takes place shortly after the events of Deadstock and while Blue War could work as a stand-alone novel, it really works better if you've read Deadstock first. One of the things about Thomas' world of Punktown that makes it stand above others is that it - and the characters who inhabit it - all have history, and Thomas does a wonderful job of bringing this out in his descriptions:<br /><br />\"The men and women sheltering in the gloom of the Legion of Veterans' Post 69 ranged in age from early thirties to there-are-still-people-alive-from-that-war? The bartender was a veteran of the Red War, which had cost him an arm, replaced with a black prosthesis like something grafted on from a giant beetle. Watt was a Choom, one of the indigenous people of this planet, Oasis, though most of the Earth people in the colony city dubbed Punktown had been born here, too, as had their parents and even grandparents. To all appearances Watt was human, aside from the wide mouth carved back to his ears, giving his broad face a bit of a frog-like aspect. He was, however, rather more dangerous-looking than a frog.<br />--Seated in the post were a couple of Punktown servicemen who had been deployed to the world of Echo, part of a raid on the colony city of Oracle. A group of Red Jihad extremists had captured and sabotaged the atmosphere control facilities there, resulting in the death of 37,000 colonists. One of these vets, named Isaiah, cried a lot when he'd had a few Knickersons too many, recounting the numbers of suffocated children he had seen throughout the colony, strewn everywhere like placid-faced dolls.<br />--There were the brothers, Bobby and Wally, slouched over the bar in shiny blue jackets and faded baseball hats, all covered in glittering pins and embroidered patches indicating that they'd been crewmen aboard two military starcraft in the same fleet. They were withered and cantankerous and intent on claiming their explosive space battles made every other vet's war look like a picnic in the park. Gnome-like Bobby frequently came close to blows with younger vets, infantrymen bristling at the suggestion that their ground combat could be less hellish than what this old-timer had experienced from inside his massive warship. They always restrained themselves, however, having heard that his brother Wally had once smashed the jaw of a drunken vet twenty years younger than himself, in this very bar. Not to mention that Watt was quick to break up trouble, and that plastic beetle claw could grip you by the back of the neck good and hard on your way out the door.<br />--Two black men with shaved skulls, a branded insignia on their foreheads and metallic silver bar code on the back of their necks, had been coming in to sit at one end of the bar for a few months now. No one knew what war or conflict they'd been in, and they didn't volunteer it. Maybe Watt knew, but he was discreet. They spoke to no one, not even each other, just sipped their Zubs and watched the big VT screen mounted on the walls. Their polished domes reflected the blue of a holographic sign that read: 'Zub... for a mellow buz!' \"<br /><br />In this novel, Stake, a veteran of a war known as the Blue War that took place on an alien world called Sinan, a war that ended eleven years ago, is called on by an old army buddy who wants him to go back to Sinan to help solve a mystery that is threatening to unravel the peace that has held there for eleven years.  A seemingly harmless Jin Haa urbanization project involving \"smart matter\" technology that allows a city to basically grow itself has gone wildly out of control, spilling across the border into Ha Jiin territory and swallowing up vast swathes of land. To make matters stranger still, the city has apparently created a living clone of a human, something it was not designed to do. Henderson needs Stake to try and find out what has gone wrong, and who this unknown clone child was made from, before war breaks out again. As as anyone who has read Deadstock will know, Stake himself has some unresolved history with his enemy/lover of his previous time on Sinan, the beautiful - and deadly - blue-skinned \"Earth Killer\", Thi Gonh.<br /><br />One of the things I particularly like about Thomas' characters is that they are not black or white. They have their flaws, their baggage, and in many cases their conflicts, both in themselves and with others. All of which make them all the more real, and what happens to them will matter to the reader.<br /><br />And as in Deadstock, there are a number of highly imaginative creations that are sprinkled throughout Blue War:  benders (imagine Portugese Man-o-War's that can float through the air and kill you in ways you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy), snipes (no, these aren't imaginary though you'll wish they were if you run into them), rust art, Wonky Science, smart matter, and others.<br /><br />All in all, Blue War works on a number of levels; quite an achievement for such an ambitious blending of genres. And, without giving anything away, one can only hope that there will be more, of Stake, of Thi, and of Punktown in general.  Highly recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "1844165329", "parent_asin": "1844165329", "user_id": "AHYEPWP7J2KSK4HRCA7HWM42ZFBA", "timestamp": 1269837513000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Very Dark Comic Thriller That Occasionally Veers into Grand Guignol", "text": "\"Dr. Fischer of Geneva,\"(1980), was, I believe the 25th novel published by widely-known and respected British author Graham Greene in his very long career that spanned most of the 20th century.  It is one of his last published novels, and is a 150 page, novella length, very dark comic thriller.<br /><br />It is narrated by Alfred Jones, child of a knight in the British Foreign Service, who has fallen very far socially and economically from the class into which he was born.  He does, however, have that proficiency in languages so useful to the Foreign Service, and lives and works in Switzerland, as a translator at a firm that produces that characteristic Swiss product, chocolate.  Jones, who lost both his left hand and his parents in the same night's World War II German bombardment of London, has married Anna-Luise, Fischer's beautiful heiress daughter, who is, furthermore, much his junior.  He comes to discover he hates his father-in-law, a powerful multi-millionaire who made his fortune by inventing Dentophil Bouquet, a supposedly more effective toothpaste.  Although, to be sure, the author Greene, who never lost his eye for the telling detail, has Anna-Luise tell Jones that her father doesn't use his own product: he instead uses, she says, \"Something called a Water-Pik.\"Go know that Water-Piks were even available thirty years ago.<br /><br />At any rate, Dr. Fischer is known for his dinner parties, at which he debases and humiliates other rich people, his so-called \"friends,\" whom his daughter calls \"toads.\" His guests apparently are so greedy for the lavish gifts which their host--for whom they do not really care-- will ultimately present them that they will swallow any treatment he dishes out, up to and including possible death.<br /><br />Like most of Greene's prodigious output, this novel was filmed, as an all-star television production. It was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, starred James Mason as Dr. Fischer, Alan Bates as Alfred Jones, Greta Scacchi as Anna-Luise, and Cyril Cusack as Steiner, a companion music lover of Anna-Luise's late mother.<br /><br />Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career, during which he gave us THE POWER AND THE GLORY, THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and OUR MAN IN HAVANA, among many others. Many, if not most, of his works were made into notable films.<br /><br />The author's books were very well-written, highly literate; much praised by the critics, and enjoyed a wide readership; they were frequently best sellers. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. Greene, who also worked as a screenwriter, always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals. However, if you've never read him before, I wouldn't necessarily recommend starting here. It's black-on-black, occasionally veering into Grand Guignol, to which I must admit I didn't know quite how to respond.  It's also hard to find. Might as well start with something more entertaining, like THE COMEDIANS, or TRAVELS WITH MY AUNT.", "images": [], "asin": "0140185283", "parent_asin": "0140185283", "user_id": "AHWH4MZ2KD5RASDETTSVDK3CYTGA", "timestamp": 1313763758000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Another Pointless Self-Help Book", "text": "I'm not sure why I ordered this book other than that it was free. I am not the type of person who reads self-help or business books and the one or two times in my life that I was forced to do so I couldn't see the point of the book nor did I derive anything beneficial. I have been in sales most of my life and at various points have been known as one of the top salesmen in my field. I've often been asked to share what has made me successful so I have taught classes on selling. It seems to me to be an exercise in futility. I wish it was easy to simply tell some one how to be or what to do and that success will follow. It is my belief that human beings are infinitely more complex than what the business & self-help books portray and they do not change easily, if ever. I am sure that there are people who have benefitted from this class of book but I have never met one and I suspect they are rare. People are what they are and even if you get them excited for a short time they soon revert to their norm.<br /><br />As far as this book goes it seems neither better nor worse than other books in its class. It relies on telling stories to show people how they might use different behaviours to achieve more influence. I don't think reading this book is going to enable anyone to make a profound change in their lives, just as the past twenty years worth of self-help and business books haven't seemed to make a bit of difference to anyone I know personally or within society in general. There is an old saying, \"Those who can, do, those who can't, teach\". That's why I don't teach anymore. It's depressing to try and teach something and see that the message sent just isn't ever received because of the fundamental difference in experience, motivation, outlook and thought processes between two different people. I would also offer this thought....the only way you'll change your life or influence others successfully is simply to go try doing it and get better. In other words, there is no magic words/spell/book that is going to change your world. There is only doing, practice, and gaining experience. Save your time and money, skip the book, and go practice influencing others. You'll fail a lot, but then you get better incrementally, and you'll have made progress. It's as unlikely that you'll make progress reading a book as it is unlikely that you'll learn to play the piano by reading a book. People make a lot of money by the lure of a shortcut to be found within the pages of their book but I don't know of any shortcuts to playing a piano or in learning to influence others. I sure didn't see any in this book.", "images": [], "asin": "007148499X", "parent_asin": "007148499X", "user_id": "AH34RIXGI36EBUEIHL3IMSXVL7MA", "timestamp": 1221485951000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

Each story has a unique spin on it that I just loved.<br /><br />In The Plucky Miss Ruth by Laura Rollins, the leads have met each other before, but only recently did they have the opportunity to go beyond simple pleasantries to something more meaningful. Ruth\u2019s \u201ctime loop\u201d is intriguing as is her penchant for articles on scientific discovery. The inclusion of this concept takes the story from pleasant to utterly entertaining. Her matchmaking is entertaining as well, and, of course, her own happily ever after is not far away. There hasn't been a Rollins' book I haven't liked, so I knew that I was in good hands with the opening story.<br /><br />Mr. Dowling\u2019s Remedy by Annette Lyon has one of the most interesting \u2013 and unlikely \u2013 setting of a romance that I\u2019ve read. Beverly Stanton is sent to an asylum by her conniving stepfather, where she meets Dr. Crandall Dowling. And no, he\u2019s not a doctor for the asylum, but rather a patient who suffers from what I believe would be called Tourette\u2019s syndrome today. I wasn\u2019t sure how the author would pull this off, but she does so in a compassionate, dignified way. Their romance ends up being so sweet and tender, and everything resolves in quite an exciting and unexpected way.<br /><br />A Railway through the Roses by Lisa L. Catmull is by a new-to-me author, but I loved it. It can be classified by one word \u2013 chemistry! There is such a wonderful chemistry between the two main characters. I simultaneously enjoyed it and also wanted to bonk their heads together because their solution was so obvious. However, matters of the heart were not discussed openly like matters of business. Due to being orphaned, Lady Ann is the owner of her own land and serious about being business-minded and being a good steward for those that live and work on her land. Adrian and Ann are childhood friends, so they are hung up on the concept of friendship and business, despite what simmers beneath the surface for them both. The ending is oh-so satisfying. I would love to read one of Catmull\u2019s novels since I enjoyed this novella so much.<br /><br />I highly recommend this collection to readers of historical romance.

She could (easily) have written a traditional cookbook with tons of recipes no one will ever attempt but instead, she chose practical.  We are the storytelling species  and this a collection of hers.  Thankfully we get no moralizing over sustainability, environmental preaching, diet of the day boosting or wagging fingers at human habits.  Instead we find beautiful writing - something sorely missing in the food world today.  This is NOT like the juvenile tv shows with their endless silly contests or those idiot cookbooks of Three steps, Four ingredients, Five minutes or 300 calories.

She reveals her motivations, failures, successes, what is passable, good and great.  In this case, ordinary are transformed into something new and delicious  through nine \"concoctions\" that are simultaneously interesting, basic and delicious.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Here's An Idea for the Next Boring Dinner Party you May Attend...", "text": "Well, this is a most peculiar book, very surprising and ingenious, quite different from anything you are likely to have read in the recent past or in the near future for that matter. Even the title leaves you thinking something is a bit odd...<br /><br />The very meandering plot revolves around Miles Garth, an ethical consultant, somewhere in his forties, who, one night at a dinner party in Greenwich, gets up between courses, makes his way upstairs to the spare room and locks himself in. Indefinitely. You would probably get up and isolate yourself too if you were at a dinner party with guests such as were at this dinner party. Nevertheless we never find out why he takes this course of action, in fact the reason, whatever it may be, has no bearing at all on how the story unfolds. Almost overnight Miles becomes a cause celebre, with people camping out in the street to catch a glimpse of him, organising a food delivery by basket and rope (he is vegetarian and the owner of the house he refuses to leave only feeds him slim slices of ham slid under the door), and media swarming as media does.<br /><br />Four people, closely and loosely associated with Miles narrate the four chapters - There, But, For, The. Anna met Miles on a bus tour of Europe some 20 years prior; Mark is Miles' boyfriend and had taken Miles with him to the dinner party; May is an elderly lady biding time and hating it in a rest home; and Brooke is a nine year old girl, highly intelligent, lively, bordering on precocious and loving it. There are other people too on the periphery such as the other dinner party guests, Mark's long time boyfriend, May's husband and Brooke's parents as well as Jen, the dinner party hostess.<br /><br />The message or theme of this book? Not entirely sure, but feel it has something to do with No Man Is An Island, or maybe he is, and one state or the other is neither a bad thing or a good thing. Confused?<br /><br />So we play a bit loose with the point of the book but the real pleasure of this book, what stopped me from putting it down and thinking all a bit too odd really, is the writing. It is an absolute joy to read because Ms Smith is a master of words - puns galore (Brooke LOVES puns); witty clever dialogue used in such a way that the character of the speaker is revealed without us really knowing anything about them - the dinner party is fantastic reading (I read it twice); enlightening discussions about the word 'But' for example. Brooke is truly delightful, she would be an impossible child to have in a classroom, but her observations of the adults around her, her passionate interest in her home town of Greenwich as the place that Western time is measured from, (read symbolism for the time passing in the lives of the characters) marks her out as quite the most interesting character in the book.<br /><br />The whole thing is really quite genius, I just loved her use of language, it dances all over and it all contributed to the package of what is quite an unusual book, but all in a good way. Even if I am not quite sure of its raison d'etre.", "images": [], "asin": "0375424091", "parent_asin": "0375424091", "user_id": "AEODGMBI2RFWDPCKQZ2LLWZ75IGQ", "timestamp": 1332038147000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Thaws Out Nicely", "text": "A headless and partially skinned horse is found hanging high up on a French mountain.  No ordinary horse, this is the prized thoroughbred of one of the richest men in France.  To further cloud things, DNA is found onsite from a notorious serial killer, who is incarcerated at a nearby insane asylum.  But no one \u2013 either where the horse was stabled or at the mountain \u2013 heard or saw anything.  As the police scramble to make sense of their enigmatic clues, human corpses start to turn up.<br /><br />This book is extremely effective and entertaining as a dark, moody, and rather terrifying thriller.  If your taste runs to fast pacing and lots of action, look elsewhere.  Here, you are brought into the lives of a group of detectives, doctors, and asylum inmates in a very fine detail.  There is a lot to keep track of, and things that seem unrelated at first become intriguingly intertwined.  The pace is very deliberate, sometimes lagging but then picking up with a burst of action.  The author uses suspense masterfully, keeping your curiosity and anxiety level balanced on a razor\u2019s edge.  In style and tone, this book more closely resembles a horror novel than your average mystery.<br /><br />There are a couple of odd points to note.  The original book was written in French, and it\u2019s been translated into British-English.  This brings us to Monsieur this or Madam that saying things like \u201crighty-ho\u201d, which certainly gives you pause while reading.  The police are methodical, but somewhat languorous in the way we often imagine Frenchmen to be.  There are also some lingual inaccuracies, such as when the dead horse is taken in for an autopsy, rather than a necropsy.  And there is an epilogue which introduces some bizarre and totally unexpected details, which could have probably been left out altogether.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I would not recommend it for young adult readers, because the subject matter is genuinely disturbing.  If you would like a nice, scary mystery to spend a few hours with, give this one a try.", "images": [], "asin": "1250045533", "parent_asin": "1250045533", "user_id": "AE3TGLPVBPR2KSOGYZUKPKFNQSHA", "timestamp": 1402151511000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Reads like a Korean \"Lonesome Dove\"", "text": "I am always ready to lose myself in historical fiction but I never thought that a book that takes place so recently would fascinate me. We know of Korea as a divided country that is so poor in the North that people scrounge in public parks for flowering buds or even pigeons to eat because of the constant prospect of starvation. By contrast, in the South we have corporations like Samsung and KIA who sell their products in the United States. Many of us have family in the military who have spent time in South Korea. The Korea in \"Tendrils of Life\" is a post World War 2 country reeling from years of Japanese rule and then the occupation of United Nations troops with the United States calling the shots because they defeated Japan.  A family is brought back to the mainland of South Korea after an idyllic life on an isolated island. The father seems to be a passionate follower of causes that will bring justice to the land. Of course he earns the emnity of some friends he grew up with as well as relatives. His family suffers, living hand to mouth in Seoul while the father is gone. The son,Jimin, takes menial jobs before school to help feed his mother and sister. He begins to have a lifelong resentment of his father but because the father is in jail or in hiding much of the time, he cannot express it to him. The war comes to not only the cities but the countryside and the family finds themselves being torn apart and reunited with each other and former friends. Jimin wishes so much to return to the island of his youth but he wants his family with him  and it seems that there is always a band of soldiers, bandits or physical barriers keeping him from his family. This is a roller coaster and I had to stay with it because I was so invested in the characters that I finished it very quickly.

As he interacts with the family and works on the house readers learn the tragic details of Duro's life.  The horrors of the recent Balkan wars play out in full relief in Duro's life and in this book.  This book is a brilliant example of beautiful writing, characters, and backstory.  It is laced with pathos.  This is not a book about crazy twists and turns of plot.  It is about eloquence and fully-developed characters, trying to deal with a tragic history.", "images": [], "asin": "0802121918", "parent_asin": "0802121918", "user_id": "AFK7Z2Q3GK2YVGN7VEBKPGIZPJOA", "timestamp": 1415234308000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

I have a number of his books on my TBR but I always tend to put off reading books that are what I put in the category of \"heavier novels\".

But to my surprise, this book goes a lot deeper.  I was positive you had to be an electrical engineer in order to understand the dynamics of the book.  After some closer reading, I have determined that it is not all that difficult to understand.<br /><br />And, I am sure with a deeper and closer approach to the content of the book, one can come away with some selective knowledge.<br /><br />Chapter Setup is easy to navigate throughout; each chapter with a bullet list identifies what you are to expect, plus there is an easy to understand introduction to each chapter.<br /><br />List of Figures.  It is not often that a book has a listing and page number of each of the Figures in the book.  The book contains about 150 Figures, and the reader can locate specific ones easily.  Also, each Figure demonstration is easy to read, clearly identified, and very well labeled.<br /><br />Projects.  One good thing about the information is that the author gives the reader something to do, something to try on his own.  The Projects sections are easily identified.<br /><br />Page Layout.  This is not a high book, but it is in black and white, plenty of whitespace surrounds the pages, Topics are clearly identified in Bold Font.  Diagrams, charts, demos, whatever are well spaced, nothing is crowded and easy to read the print.<br /><br />Again, do not get this book if you can't figure how your IPAD or IPOD work.  But what you will learn is the concept of electronics, principles that formt he basis of electronics.  Here is an idea of some of the topics you will learn about;  Electronics - atoms, charge, conductors, magnetism, voltage sources, systems, linear circuits, binary, how microcomputers work, wireless, satellites, audio electronics, digital, video tech, cable, etc., etc.<br /><br />Again, the average person, like me, will not understand the majority of this book, but you will always get something out of it.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good reading even for a youngish adult", "text": "Sequel to Melissa Marr's Wicked Lovely Fragile Eternity reacquaints us with Seth, Ash and Keenar as they struggle with the consequences of the previous novel's conclusion. Ash plays the reluctant immortal, Seth deals with the devil to be with Ash, and Keenar continues with his romantic pursuit of Ash.<br /><br />Risking a cheesy Twilight rip-off, Fragile Eternity does quite well (as predicted in my review of Ink Exchange I might add.) The characters seem genuine and 3-d and the plot flows without becoming mired in drippy romantic dialogue.<br /><br />There are a couple of flaws. First is an issue I have with many urban fantasy novels, which is that they play too much as a series, as in far too much page time is given to build up for cataclysmic future events, can either lead to tension being defused somewhat over the story, and/or disappointment in the end when some issues are left unresolved.<br /><br />Second is Marr's supernatural imagery. What is quite a cool idea- The faerie folk having elemental effects on the environment around then, and War in particular having strange-bird like features- is somewhat diminished by the clipped and plain prose used to describe them. I imagine it would all look awesome on the big screen, but in a novel reader's need a little more descriptive writing, perhaps and appeal to senses other than sight (for example if ice is forming on the walls, shouldn't the characters feel cold?)<br /><br />A prior flaw that is less evident in this novel is the overuse of Faerie politics and practice carrying the plot. Most of what goes on in Fragile eternity is easy to follow, and interesting. Marr's series is definitely worth a read, as going by my theories each following book will be better than the last, by the forth we could have a sure best-seller.", "images": [], "asin": "006121471X", "parent_asin": "006121471X", "user_id": "AFCZERNJOXNOVCXZ4NZKIAITHEAQ", "timestamp": 1268626716000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Hardboiled pastoral", "text": "Published shortly before the author's suicide in 1950, after an affair with an American actress, the hardboiled nature of Cesare Pavese's final novel demonstrates his skill, honed by translations of American literature, in integrating the hardboiled prose style or Chandler, Cain, and Hemingway back into Italian. Or vice versa, as R.W. Flint's rendering in turn of Pavese emphasizes its affinities. I am reminded of how Hemingway tried to convey Spanish idioms or Italian landscapes in his own fiction, so Pavese's familiar tone, for American readers in this 2002 edition for New York Review Classics, should find a ready reception among those curious to see how an Italian enamored of American sensibilities tries to work them into his own language, and his own post-war, pastoral sensibilities.<br /><br />The results, to me, are modest but successful on these terms. Mark Rudman's introduction might be read as an afterward, for he gives away the whole plot and its climactic scene. However, Pavese's decision to treat that as the final two pages of his novel, and to cut away from any lasting denouement, attests to his skill, and daring.<br /><br />Other writers would have softened this or pressed it into a framework more pliable. It's true that for long stretches of this 150-page novel, not much happens, on the other hand, so the action that does occur, told in retrospect, does matter more. I was not as pulled into the narrative as I expected. Perhaps as a Californian, viewing the remove at which Oakland, Fresno, the great valleys, and the desert of this state are evoked in a stylized manner (reminding me of the rather endearing way Kafka imagined his Amerika) kept me distanced. I was not convinced by the narrator's loves or adventures, for these--nodding back to the tough-guy inspirations--are not given enough depth to draw you close.<br /><br />However, in the smells of Italy's lime trees, the legend of how the moon fructifies the fields if bonfires are set at its margins, and how as in 1914, so since: war is &#34;a lot of dogs unchained by their masters to murder each other and keep their masters in control&#34; (88), there is enough to satisfy a reader. &#34;Maybe it is better that way, better for everything to go up in a bonfire of dry grass and for people to begin again. That was how it was in America--when you were sick of something, a job or a place, you changed it. Over there even whole towns, with taverns, city halls and stores, are as empty now as graveyards.&#34; (120-1) This sparely told narrative leaves its impression, in a muted, melancholic manner.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Teenage Sydney Bristow from Alias meets X-Men`s Mystique w/ a couple significant weaknesses", "text": "IMPOSTOR, the first book in Suzanne Winnacker's Variant series, is kind of like a teenage Sydney Bristow from Alias meets X-Men`s Mystique. Tessa has been recruited to the FEA (Forces with Extraordinary Abilities) branch of the FBI. She's been training for two years and honing her chameleon-like ability to take on the appearance of anyone she touches. At sixteen she gets her first mission tracking a serial killer.<br /><br />The premise is really strong and the investigation takes a number of cool turns, not the least of which is the whole Variant concept which includes all kinds of abilities from invisibility to mind reading. The Variant idea isn't groundbreaking, nor is Veronica Mars-esque teen investigator, but what made IMPOSTOR work was the mystery/thriller plot which, apart from an uneven start, kept me guessing and engaged until the very end.<br /><br />While the story and concept were solid, there were a couple significant weaknesses. The writing isn't quite as good as I was hoping. It's very melodramatic, and the pacing was rushed. And Tessa as a character was really immature for someone in her situation. She was thoughtless and childish and realistically would never have been given as much control in a HUGE investigation based on her behavior. Which brings me to my second gripe with this book: the romance. It never came close to working for me. Alec, Tessa's slightly older trainer, is her longtime crush. He's got a girlfriend (who is a catty, vicious, witch-but a great guy like Alec is still into her), but he still has cuddling movie dates with Tessa and tons of almost-kissing moments. It made no sense that he would be interested in a girl as immature as Tessa despite their shared love of horror films.<br /><br />Despite the flaws, the strength of the story carried me easily to the very last page of IMPOSTOR. Hopefully, Tessa will grow by the next book in the Variant series since I'd kinda like to see where her story goes.<br /><br />Sexual content:<br />Kissing.

I don't know if, like Paul, I will face another round that will ultimately be the reason for my death.<br /><br />I do know, that like Paul, a consequence of having faced a cancer diagnosis is, even for someone like me who is not an ambitious doctor with much lower stress commitments, something that has caused me in a teeth-grindingly obvious cliche to want my energy spent in pursuit of the contentment one finds through family and friends and rejection of the urges society dictates in favor of things that create connection.<br /><br />Paul writes to his daughter Cady not to discount the joy she brought him, dying, as she lay on his lap: a little piece of the ever present now a parent can not deny or put off or fake.<br /><br />And while my own children were not of lap age during my diagnosis, and I am facing the loss of my own identity as their parent as they enter the high school years just before leaving home, I do believe that the best of all possible results of living through cancer treatment and the resulting lifetime of uncertainty is to live contentedly.\u00a0<br /><br />So if reading this book (along with Atul Gawande's Being Mortal) makes me a bit maudlin and cliche..so be it.

Still, Bite Me was a hilarious Moore novel that probably ranks in the middle of all his books with Lamb being him in top form and Fluke near the bottom for me. The ending also felt too rushed, but there are plenty of vampire kitties and enjoyable dialogue to push all the right buttons. Bite Me also made me realize how much I missed the Emperor of San Francisco.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Movie Music Making", "text": "I read this book by mistake!<br /><br />I\u2019m a lone-wolf video shooter.  I have a small background in music: I play (without much skill) several instruments; have studied (at a rudimentary level) music composition;  can use Adobe Audition with a little skill. But music is the weakest part of my videos. I wanted to learn more about video and movie music to improve my videos. The blurb for this book talked about going beyond technique so I started reading.<br /><br />The book is aimed at people interested in being part of the process of making movie music as composers, music editors, music supervisors and perhaps even as film editors. It takes the form of twenty interviews with people in these professions.<br /><br />There is a remarkable similarity in what they say. Don\u2019t get into this business unless you really love it. You will have to spend long hours at work. You will have periods when you can\u2019t get a job.  Movie music making is a collaborative process, but not without friction. It can be tough on your personal life. It can provide great joy. Networking is important.<br /><br />The book is clearly aimed at those who think they want to enter the movie music professions. Although unsaid, I\u2019m sure there are many folks who had that aspiration and have turned to other things. Perhaps they would have given up the dream before trying if they had read this book (and believed it).<br /><br />The interviews themselves don\u2019t appear to have been edited very much, but in some ways, that adds a ring of truth to what is said. Saltzman has a set of basic questions that he asks but like most good interviewers he will go off his planned path when he hears something interesting. Occasionally, the interviews sound so similar that it\u2019s hard to distinguish them. That just adds to the verisimilitude.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Saltzman did not provide black letter definitions of composer, music editor and music supervisor. That may be because there is so much overlap. I suspect that this did not significantly impair the usefulness of this book.<br /><br />For what it\u2019s worth, I read an electronic version of the book on the publisher\u2019s Vital Source Bookshelf software. It is quirky and a bit frustrating to use.<br /><br />I can\u2019t recommend this book to anyone not contemplated a career in movie or video music. For those who are, this is essential reading.<br /><br />Note: The publisher provided me with a review copy of this book at no charge.", "images": [], "asin": "B0B75N4TSX", "parent_asin": "B0B75N4TSX", "user_id": "AG5PK25GTSF3Z5KDP2464Y7Z4J3Q", "timestamp": 1668260609343, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Critically Important Secrecy!", "text": "In 1933 when Adolph Hitler came to power, Albert Einstein, a Jewish professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences was visiting the United States. Einstein did not return to Germany, but, remained in the United States and became a naturalized citizen in 1940. At about that same time upon the eve of the full breaking out of World War II, Einstein endorsed a letter to then President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt informing him that scientists in Germany were on the verge of developing &#34;extremely powerful bombs of a new type&#34;. This lead to the establishment of the highly secretive Manhattan Project to begin intensive research into this critically important scientific field. Three widely separated remote areas of the United States: Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Los Alamos, New Mexico and Richland (Hanford), Washington were chosen as locations for the research and development locations for this project. In each location many parcels of private property were taken by the Federal Government by imminent domain, sometimes done so quickly that time was barely allowed for existing crops to be harvested. In the State of Washington, the residents of the small towns of Richland, Hanford and White Bluffs had to be relocated. In 1943 Richland had a population of 243. By the time that this new government facility reached peak production, in less than two years, the population was 51,000. Security and secrecy were so intense and enforced that workers had no idea about the product or even if there was a product on which they were working. Rumors were everything from campaign buttons to toilet paper. The bomb tested at the Trinity Site, near Alamogordo, New Mexico on July 16, 1945, contained plutonium from Hanford. The bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 1945, also contained plutonium manufactured at the Hanford plant. Some days later when Japan surrendered the local paper announced what had been actually going on at Hanford. This book is a fascinating insight into those days and how Richland developed afterward.", "images": [], "asin": "0738520616", "parent_asin": "0738520616", "user_id": "AHOHRKO43QRJP4K77KAXQYLF6HSA", "timestamp": 1444169766000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

I own most of the other Cambodian cookbooks that are currently available to Westerners, as well as a few, such as Elephant Walk, that are currently out of print. I find that this book does not repeat the recipes that are in the other books, for the most part, except for a few staple recipes. I also like the author's approach to make the recipes authentic, but with ingredients that are more accessible to the US audience to which it is targeted. For example, one appetizer uses grape leaves to wrap, instead of Yucca leaves, that the author knows will not be easily available to most.<br /><br />The reason that I am giving this book only four stars is that the price for this book is quite expensive for what it is. I have hundreds of cookbooks, and this book is overpriced. I understand that this is not the authors fault, but at $39.95 for a paperback book, with non-glossy pages, that is little over a hundred pages, I do think that the publisher is exaggerating a bit!<br /><br />I do still consider myself lucky to have this cookbook, as it has some great recipes, and it is one of the few books on Cambodian cuisine out there. I would also recommend searching for the Elephant Walk cookbook by Longteine \"Nyep\" de Monteiro, which has some excellent recipes as well.<br /><br />Post note - I do also wish that the author had mentioned that if you are able to find taro leaves in your market - PLEASE COOK THEM. They are toxic when raw, which I found out when I ate a bit the size of a quarter. The burning in your throat can be soothed by milk or yogurt, but it can be pretty dangerous if you eat a large amount of the leaves.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Recommended only for beginning writers who can't come up with a topic", "text": "I purchased this text because it was required reading for a creative writing class. After reading several of the chapters, I find myself disappointed with it.  Although Miller and Paolo do provide a useful overview of different styles of nonfiction, as well as references to strong writers within the genre, I was less impressed with their suggestions for a new writer.  The book tends towards the overly flowery, from my point of view, and has some writing prompts that I find ridiculous or overly simplistic.  In a chapter on writing about family, for example, one prompt encourages the writer to \"describe every member of your family in terms of a part of the body ... Look at belly buttons, fingerprints, moles, toe-nails, or tongues\" (23). Another section asks the writer to create an essay around three time periods in the person's life, all written in present tense, before trying to find a connection between them. While I don't doubt that effective essays can be written around the prompts in the book, I did not find them helpful in addressing the different ideas in which I am personally invested.<br /><br />I should note that I am a graduate student and have taken several nonfiction classes, so my expectations for the text are possibly different than those of someone looking for an introduction to creative nonfiction. If you want to write nonfiction but struggle to come up with your own topic, then this book's basic prompts might be helpful to get you started (before you hopefully move on to other texts).  If, however, you already have ideas but want better advice on how to strengthen your actual writing, I do not recommend this work at all.<br /><br />Instead, may I suggest [[ASIN:0393326659 In Fact: The Best of Creative Nonfiction]], edited by Lee Gutkind, which is a wonderful anthology of creative nonfiction?

Krantz looking at the evidence he\u2019s studied since 1965 to conclude that there is a nonhuman bipedal in North America.<br /><br />Originally published in 1992 and republished with an addendum in 1999, Krantz looked at the evidence supporting the existence of Sasquatch in the first two-thirds of the original book from looking at the footprint evidence and then analyzing the Patterson-Gimlin film subject and all the evidence pointing to its authenticity of a real animal.  The final third of the original text was Krantz looking at evidence of other unknown bipedal animals from around the world and examining those researching Sasquatch.  Three academic articles that Krantz wrote were added at the end of the original book followed by the 1999 addendum that Krantz addressed major and minor developments but doing so by following chapter title of the original edition and inserting information there thus giving these added pages a nice structure.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Haitian Ithaca", "text": "This is labeled a novel, but that is stretching things. By his own admission, Haitian-Canadian author Dany Laferri&egrave;re writes only about himself; this book is essentially a memoir of his return to Haiti after spending 33 years as an exile in Montreal. A memoir, moreover, written largely in verse, though short passages of prose increasingly break up that texture. Although written as sixty separately-titled poems -- chapters, trains-of-thought, call them what you will -- there is a narrative line of sorts. Awakened in the middle of the night by news of his father's death in New York, the writer tidies his affairs in ice-bound Montreal, takes the train south to attend his father's memorial service, then flies to the heat and color of Haiti to break the news to his mother. She has remained in Port-au-Prince all these years after her husband's exile by Papa Doc Duvalier half a century before, only to see her son similarly forced into exile by the dictator's son, Baby Doc. And now his return.<br /><br />I read this 2009 winner of the prestigious Prix M&eacute;dicis in French, before it was translated into English, and have not seen this translation; any quotations here are my own, and possibly inferior. It would have posed an interesting task, though not because the language is especially difficult. On the contrary, Laferri&egrave;re writes in simple slightly idiomatic French, with an admirable directness of expression. But the very simplicity of the language, poetry that reads almost as prose (or vice-versa), leaves the translator no obvious stylistic or structural guidelines to mark the difference between flat fidelity and the author's finely-tuned evocation of the sights, scents, sounds, and people of his native land. There are charming moments, certainly: a cemetery painted in bright colors and primitive style by people for whom \"death seems as simple as saying good morning\"; or \". . . the lazy walk of a cow out for its evening stroll, the night becoming a Chagall.\" But horrors also: street people roasting a cat on a spit while its owner calls \"Mitzi\" in the distance; a woman whose son dies at the side of the highway because cars won't stop for fear she may be a bait for robbers. The book is full of comments about things that change, things that stay the same, and that terrible Haitian history, turning it into a land to which one can truly belong only in exile. All seen through the eyes of this middle-aged Odysseus returning to an overcrowded Ithaca where poverty and beauty go hand in hand.<br /><br />I have to say that there were sections in the middle of the book where I could not discern much direction. Laferri&egrave;re meets up with person after person whose main interest in meeting him seems to be \"to confirm that they are not dead.\" The prose thickens and pushes out the verse. But then at the very end, the opposite happens. Laferri&egrave;re goes to Barad&egrave;res, the little village on the coast where his father was born. The prose ends. The verse becomes more poetic, at one point even evoking Rimbaud. In the shade of a banana tree, time is suspended. Finally, a true arrival . . . but one that feels like a kind of farewell.", "images": [], "asin": "0857050486", "parent_asin": "0857050486", "user_id": "AGCWDKIATRJJB7QSRKWICHCKWQHQ", "timestamp": 1378434290000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fun tales south of the border", "text": "This is a collection of stories written by Mike Mignola about the five months that Hellboy spent in Mexico back in 1956.<br /><br />Hellboy in Mexico--Hellboy and Abe Sapien are stuck in the Mexican desert in 1982. They seek shelter in an abandoned gas station where Abe discovers a picture of Hellboy with some luchedores (Mexican wrestlers). Hellboy tells a story from his 1956 sojourn in Mexico. He went with two other B.P.R.D. agents to investigate some mass killings. Things were horrible and the other two left. Hellboy joined up with a band of luchedores who were already fighting vampires and other monsters. He doesn't know any Spanish but they manage to fight all day and drink all night, until the demons get the better of them. A bittersweet ending was in store, triggering a five-month stay in Mexico that is aptly described as &quot;a drunken blur.&quot; The story is a great blend of horror and humor. The art by Richard Corben is distinct from Mignola's style but works very well for the story.<br /><br />Hellboy versus the Aztec Mummy--Hellboy catches up to a bat-demon and has a big fight with it and a bunch of zombies. There isn't much story here, just plenty of atmospheric fun. The exposition dump at the end is probably unnecessary other than filling out the bottom of the last page.<br /><br />Hellboy Gets Married--The drunken blur continues as Hellboy follows a mariachi band with a cute senorita in tow. He winds up marrying her though it turns out his beer goggles are exceptionally thick. Big fight ensues. The tale is a bit formulaic for Hellboy but Mignola includes lyrics from a few melancholic Mexican ballads to help set the tone. The weird talking wedding ring/snake is pretty cool too.<br /><br />The Coffin Man--A small girl bursts into a bar asking help for her uncle. The locals say they buried him yesterday, so what's the deal? She's worried about the Coffin Man, a grave-robbing zombie witch. Hellboy, being a stand-up guy, stands up and head out to help the girl watch over her uncle's grave. This story showcases the weird, made up mythology that Mignola is so good at crafting.<br /><br />House of the Living Dead--Hellboy has joined the luchedor circuit (mostly for drinking money) when he is called out by a mysterious doctor to fight the doctor's latest creation. That creation turns out to be Frankenstein's monster. The other classic Universal monsters (Dracula and the Wolf Man) show up, making a nice homage to the 1930's films. The story is both fun and melancholic, the classical Mignola blend. The art by Richard Corben follows the Hellboy in Mexico style and makes a nice conclusion to this book.<br /><br />The book also contains one-page introductions by Mignola discussing the origins of the stories and weird details (who knew that Mexican vampires can turn into turkeys?). The back has various sketches by the artists working on the stories. They are almost all drafts of final art, which I find only mildly interesting.

So, it did take me a bit of an adjustment to start this book, but I realize too that I'm not necessary the intended audience for this book. And that's okay. Because the themes and message of Moxie are relatable to girls and women of any age, I think, and it also carries about it the innocence and awkwardness of just growing up, and dealing with school, family, friends, and first loves.<br /><br />Viviane and her group of friends are juniors in the small town of East Rockport. Life is the same, year after year. High school football is the town's religion, and the football players and popular kids rule the school. This year is different though. There are two new transfer students, Lucy from Houston and Seth from Austin. Lucy is a vibrant, activist-type girl from the city who doesn't really understand the small town ways of East Rockport. And Seth is...Seth? I'm not really sure what to make of Seth. He's apparently cute, and not like the other guys. So, he's the love interest, but also kind of one-dimensional as a character. I loved Viviane though, her best friend Claudia, Lucy, and some other girls who take up the Moxie fight in the book.<br /><br />The &#34;moxie&#34; term starts when Viviane is inspired by her mother's rebel teenage years and enraged by the awfulness of what she and the other girls have to put up with in school. The boys are sexist and everything described in this book escalates and everything they do is totally disgusting and gross. The top guy behind the sexist shirts, the sexual harassment, and the like is the star player on the school's football team, and is also the son of the high school principal. Viviane is inspired from the '90s and decides to create &#34;zines&#34; (which I guess are little pamphlets or mini booklets?) and anonymously places them around the school to spur girls into action against the injustice of the patriarchy at their school.<br /><br />I liked Viviane and can see her passion for sticking up for what she believes in, despite her own insecurities about whether or not she'll get in trouble with the school. I love that this book doesn't pit girls against girls, but shows how lovely a book can be when all the girls get together and stand up for one another.<br /><br />There is a bit of a love story as far as teenage romances go. It's cute, I guess? I like that Viviane fights back and challenges Seth when he tries to make &#34;not all men...&#34; comments when Viviane complains about the boys at their high school. But I like that Seth is trying to learn and do better at the end, so there's that.<br /><br />Some issues I did have with the book is that while it does try to incorporate diversity and inclusion, it's still very much told from a white, cis het POV. There's maybe four (by my count) POC mentioned in the book who Viviane talks and interacts with. The book does go into race a little bit, but not much.<br /><br />Also, I'm not entirely sure how I feel that the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters were included only when Viviane stumbles upon two girls together (who are still closeted). With this scene, it was also mentioned that there's two guys in their senior year in the theatre department who are probably gay, but it's not clear, just rumors. The entire scene feels like a last-minute addition, and it would have been better to have been more upfront with including LGBTQ+ characters rather than an off-handed mention that spanned all of three pages in the book. Again, this story is set in a small Texas town, but I think it would have been nice for more inclusion instead of just being a side note.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a strong feminist novel and I loved seeing girls helping girls and seeing them empowering each other throughout the novel. The ending is on a good note, and a powerful YA contemporary that I would recommend to teens and young adults.<br /><br />***I received an ARC from PenguinTeen in a giveaway***", "images": [], "asin": "1626726353", "parent_asin": "1626726353", "user_id": "AFGD46BWRQP2UBU34MNNHDY6LIAQ", "timestamp": 1505869812017, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Interesting characters, unlikely ending", "text": "Geraldine Brooks' novel, Year of Wonders, offers a compelling story of considerable hardships, trials, and experience of human nature under extreme circumstances. There were several strengths to the novel and a few flaws that in my mind kept the novel from obtaining 5 stars.<br /><br />One considerable strength to the novel is the development of the character of Anna Frith, one of the most level-headed female characters in English literature since Elizabeth Bennett in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. We see the world through this woman of high intelligence and astute observational ability. Brooks develops a cast of characters that is broad and compelling. Even though there are multiple characters of all classes and dispositions, the reader seems to be able to visualize them and keep them straight.<br /><br />There are however a few weaknesses to the novel that keep it from getting a 5 out of 5 score. One of these is that there often too many heroic actions on the part of Anna Frith, making her seem unrealistic at times. I am certain this aspect of the novel may make Anna a highly compelling and likable character for many readers, but too much heroism becomes suspect. For example, Anna and another woman put on men's clothes and mine ore so a poor orphan girl doesn't lose her inheritance. Having never been in the mines, they obtain a full day's worth of ore and use a highly dangerous method of mining with no experience with explosives. Unfortunately the ending is also highly unlikely and is actually the most unsatisfactory portion of the novel.<br /><br />I remained entertained throughout the novel but I reached several points in the book where I became frustrated with the heroine engaging in too many deeds that were unrealistic and which bordered on fantasy.", "images": [], "asin": "0142001430", "parent_asin": "0142001430", "user_id": "AE7ES2UA5N2JCEHUR5MZ6IU5RZ6A", "timestamp": 1235521487000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Blog reviews often contain links which are not reproduced here, nor will updates or modifications to the blog review be replicated here.  Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.<br /><br />Note that I don't really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't.  I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading!  The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited.  So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).<br /><br />I rated this book WORTHY!<br /><br />This is a very short children's picture book, so there isn\u2019t a lot to review. It\u2019s about a kid with a delightfully wild imagination (he reminds me of my own kids whose imaginations, thankfully, have never deserted them even though they're now way too old for a book like this), who appears to be stranded amidst hot lava which is invading his home from all quarters. Can he leap to freedom? Where will he land? (You might be surprised!)<br /><br />The drawings are rudimentary but very colorful, and really evocative. The book is as full of excitement and danger as Harry is full of ideas and wild descriptions, but he never panics, and is always planning his escape. This is definitely something your kids will want to play - perhaps after exploring what real lava looks like - not in person of course - but from the safety of a TV documentary or something on the web.<br /><br />Who knows, perhaps you have a budding vulcanologist in your family? I recommend this book for a fun read alone, but it\u2019s also a great starting point for a chance to stir your child's imagination about the wonders of planet Earth and it's geology and inner structure.<br /><br />Of course, you don't want to load them up with learning, learning, learning and nothing else, so it occurs to me that a whole day could be themed around this as they're encouraged to explore the idea, starting with the book, then a video, then perhaps go looking for rocks in the yard or at the park (assuming your park isn't buried under snow at this point!), and imagine how hot things would have to be to melt an actual rock!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A masterpiece that should be widely read", "text": "Relatively few people are alive today who experienced any aspect of WWII as a teenager or older. Fewer still live in countries where the WWII experience can be freely discussed, as in the United States and UK. The Soviet Union considered the war to be a people's war and only recently have stories of individual experiences been forthcoming. In Germany, less and less attention is paid to the horrendous crimes of the German people. France dramatizes its miniscule, if even existent, role. And in Japan, as Hastings points, out widespread denial is still the norm. As a result, accurate knowledge of WWII and its horrors and few glories is rapidly fading from human consciousness - and with that forgetfulness comes the danager of new and even more horrible wars.<br /><br />  Max Hastings writes highly readable military histories. He eschews footnotes and the minutia of academic writing in favor of a friendly narrative style. There is considerable depth, however. In its 550 pages, Hastings covers a war that spanned the years 1931 - 1945 and a bit beyond. It covered a larger geographic area than any other conflict in history, though most of the area was the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />  The book opens on the saddest possible note: the dedication is to Max Hasting's son who apparently died at age 27 in 2000. And on that sad note, the deaths of millions and unspeakable cruelties at the hands of the Japanese are chronicled in the following pages.<br /><br />  In twenty-two chapters, Hastings treats every major aspect of the war against the Japanese by the primary combatants: the United States, Britain, China and late in the game, the Soviet Union.<br /><br />  Hastings begins with a look at the motivation and goals of the United States. President Roosevelt had announced the goal was unconditional surrender. In recent years, revisionist historians have claimed that this policy prolonged the war. Throughout the book, Hastings demolishes these arguments over and over again. It is quite something to see: Hastings has a clear mastery of the subject.<br /><br />  He then goes on to describe the various battlefronts and he is equally at home here. He uses dozens, if not hundreds, of interviews and memoirs to create his descriptions of battles like the British Burma campaign, the Battle of Leyte Gulf and so on, all the time weaving in the machinations of the main players in the Japanese, US, British and other governments. It is a very effective approach. His descriptions of the battles on Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the sea war at the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the kamikazee campaign leave no room for doubt as to why the Americans feared the blood cost of an invasion of Japan.<br /><br />  This is a critical history and Hastings heaps it on. The vastly overrated Douglas MacArthur is cut appropriately down to size, though Hastings does laud his post-war stewardship of Japan. Hastings criticizes the revisionists, apologists and anti-Americans who condemn the United States for its actions, such as the use of nuclear weapons. He spares nothing in his criticism and outright condemnation of Japanese leaders, past and present for the widespread atrocities.<br /><br />  I devour history and there are few well-written histories, so I found myself dealing with \"Retribution\" as if it were a great thriller and couldn't wait to get from one page to another. I truly wish that books like this were require reading in America's schools so chilren would grow up with an understanding of why they enjoy such lavish freedom.

Aiden and Saige are one of those couples you fall in love with.  And their friends are even better.  The more I read, the more Tedi reminded me of Lennon and the guys are just the worst sidekicks anyone could want, but in a good way.<br />This is one of those stories that will stick with me.  Aiden is a lonely guy that doesn\u2019t see himself in a relationship during his time in the NHL and Saige has been badly burned and is not looking forward to getting her heart broken again, but the attraction is there since the moment they meet and there is no way around it when they start spending time together as the season progresses.<br />I really enjoyed these characters, their backstories and I swooned over their love story.<br /><br />5 super lucky stars<br />*ARC Review*", "images": [], "asin": "B097CH79P2", "parent_asin": "B097CH79P2", "user_id": "AEWCZID74C2JJTMKQTNZ3Q6TQFMA", "timestamp": 1624941649778, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

It's a virtual museum of historical objects and persons to make any history buff drool.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Financial Prophesy of 2000 Seen Too Late", "text": "Thomas Friedman has had the benefits of living and working across most of the world's cultural, financial and political spheres, and has learned to synthesize his reporting facts and insights in a fashion that most readers can digest. The Lexus and The Olive Tree was published in 1999, and examines the building financial concentration of monetary power of corporate businesses in their relationship to country and global governance.<br /><br />The Lexus is used as a symbol for how everyone appear content to us the trading system we know Anno 2020 as Globalization as a means to acquire personal wealth and security, and the Olive Tree is used as a reference to our individual needs to retain a sense of local color, culture and tradition.<br /><br />He introduced readers to the power and speed a global herd of financial traders use to punish and adjust to their will and norm any country, region or business that does not conform to the accounting standards adopted by, mostly, US institutions such as Moody's. This herd, according to his reporting, now possess more power than big countries or armies, and are able to ruin or stop whole industries that are not meeting their analysis for generating profits quickly enough.<br /><br />He alludes to this with \"Today's markets are so big, so diverse and, with the advent of the internet, becoming so fast, that they can never be made immune from crisis. Global financial crisis will be the norm in this coming era (p371).' ...Because both booms and the busts will be coming faster.<br /><br />Oddly enough, or not, the author appear to believe that the only solution countries and their populations have with globalization is to shrug on the 'golden straight-jacket' and bend to the faster and faster changes driven by relentless technological innovation and the need for a narrow, profit driven basis of community.<br /><br />He does concede, in an America centrist manner, that America is, and will be, for the near future, the  Michael Jordan of geopolitics, but that we cannot thrive  without the rest of the world. In his concluding analysis he speaks of the concern that 'the hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist.' This refers, of course, to the overarching monopoly on military power held by the US.<br /><br />He quotes a Silicon Valley executive as 'I don't want to talk about unhealthy and unproductive people' as, perhaps, a thematic philosophy held by the financial and entrepreneurial global elites. As for the concerns over our ability to keep our sanity, customs, cultures and olive trees he suggests that it may be mostly to the degree that our McDonald's look a as local as possible. However, he does predict that \"you will star to see truly crazy revolts against monotony and standardization..'<br /><br />Mr. Friedman's book was a good read in 2000, but it may be an essential book in 2020-30 as all global communities examine their life styles, risks and employ-ability in the face of a financial global system that is so complex that no one can be identified as being in-charge. Likewise, it may be a survival issue for many Americans to re-examine the social networks adopted by EU countries where medical care and social security are not tied to an employer who may not be around long enough to securely fund social safety nets. Readers may also want to reflect on the destabilizing effects of global wars that have been primarily driven by commercial resource control goals by large corporations, and how this, along with climate change has created over 100 million of homeless, unemployed migratory people who are swarming the borders of the Western countries.", "images": [], "asin": "1250013747", "parent_asin": "1250013747", "user_id": "AHOXXWAEK5LA7ITVUMBFBTZGZA6Q", "timestamp": 1624415563478, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Hiroshima and The Bomb, a Primer", "text": "Though I had my general comments fixed in my head prior to putting pen to paper and reviewing Wallace\u2019s \u201cCountdown 1945\u201d (C45), I thought I\u2019d check what other readers had written to see if I could be persuaded to alter what I had in mind.  I skimmed many Amazon reviews and they were pretty much what I expected.  Overall, a 4.2 average rating which is a nice solid number but not a rave by any stretch, nor a clunk.  The distribution had two humps, a bit unusual.  A very high number of 5 stars as expected, but a surprisingly high number of 1 stars as well, with a deeper than usual valley in the middle.  So, a case of love it or hate it.  And I suspect after looking at some comments, both sides of the coin seemed to be occasionally influenced by political considerations.<br /><br />I\u2019ve read a fair amount of WWll history, and  I didn\u2019t learn much new in this book.  I should add that I have also visited some of the key sites described in the book, including the Trinity test area and Los Alamos (a small museum is one of the few reminders of what happened there).  I also visited the \u201creception office\u201d in Santa Fe where new hires were directed before transportation to their new \u201csecret home town\u201d, about 40-50 miles northwest.<br /><br /> C45 is a fast, easy read; it has only 276 pages, and many of those have photos.  Wallace skims over several issues, options and key players and teams, including the crew of the bomber, the Enola Gay.  Much of the writing is very anecdotal.<br /><br />Wallace tries to explain why he wrote this book, but that part of the book seemed a bit lame.  I read some speculation the this might be the first of a series of \u201cCountdown\u201d books.  Maybe Chris is going to school on one of his former Fox colleagues\u2026..?  I think this may be a good book for a high school student to read.  After all it does cover one of the most critical events of the last century, and one that we still live with today.

Twenty five years ago, after a society picnic held by businessman and politician Zeus Kronon, Zeus\u2019 headstrong daughter Dita was found murdered. Her boyfriend, Cass Gianis, confessed to the crime.Now Cass has been released from prison into the care of his twin, Mayoral candidate Paul Gianis, who is in the middle of a high profile political campaign. But Dita\u2019s brother Hal is convinced there is information surrounding his sister\u2019s death that remains buried \u2013 and he won\u2019t rest until he\u2019s discovered the truth.<br /><br />I\u2019ve long been a fan of Scott Turow\u2019s novels since many years ago I read the brilliant \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d He does write the most terrific legal mystery novels and this one was no exception to the rule.<br /><br />Mr Turow always writes with great depth when it comes to relationships and the emotional resonance of how events affect us, weaving a tale around people and places that is always compelling, clever and thrilling to read \u2013 here he explores the ties that bind identical twins. Cass and Paul are so alike and yet so very different \u2013 when Cass is released after serving a 25 year sentence for murder, they hope to rediscover their relationship and get on with life. They reckon without Hal, who is absolutely certain that the whole truth has yet to be revealed.<br /><br />I was immersed in this one immediately \u2013 I found both Cass and Paul to be extremely fascinating, their relationship being a naturally close one \u2013 and as the themes of family, betrayal, love and loss are explored here, the picture starts to become clearer\u2026or does it..<br /><br />As we follow along with the investigation undertaken by Hal\u2019s employee\u2019s and watch the legal battle unfold, it is captivating, highly entertaining and often emotional. Just what did happen on that fateful night all those years ago ? Cass may have confessed but Hal has no doubt that there is more to it \u2013 he is tenacious, difficult, unable to let go and often aggravating but he, also, is a completely fascinating character.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "innovate or disappear", "text": "There have been many books in the past few years lamenting the slowing of economic growth. Some pin the blame on specific triggers such as the financial crisis of 2008. In this book, the authors explain why the giant leaps in technology has not resulted in corresponding economic upturns. They contrast this to the rapid growths in the past after major industrial revolutions. They blame four factors, namely, gray capital, corporate managerialism, globalization, and complex regulation.<br /><br />Each of these factors are fascinating. Gray ownership, they say, is capitalism without capitalists. The main problem today is that corporations have grown so huge that no one knows who owns what. Traditional capitalists own the company and they provide the drive that propels their companies forward. Today, shareholders leave the companies to be driven by paid executives. And the shareholding in companies are also layered in that the shareholders are often hedge-funds. The rise of such corporations is due in large part, the authors say, to globalization. They also claim that the rise of bureaucracy and red tape in these corporations slow down growth. 'Managerialism has become the meta-ideology of the business world'. It has led to the downfall of the mighty Nokia and Motorola. Size was no longer capable of balancing transaction costs.<br /><br />The authors further claim that the inclination towards a high degree of specialization in the globalised world ironically slows down innovation. At the same time, increasing regulations especially after the financial crisis of 2008 has an adverse impact on innovation. In country after country innovative schemes such as Uber are attacked, and consequently, many such businesses join politics to fight the regulators. Politics and regulations sometimes find themselves behind technological advances. The drones of Amazon and the electric cars of Tesla are examples of the tussle between regulators and technology.<br /><br />Ignorance is the father of fear, so the faster technology advances, the greater the fear and scepticism of the masses.

She graduated from college early and became a FBI Special Agent She was the best in her field of expertise; a profiler that found the lost and saved them. She didn't feel like celebrating when she closed a case. All she ever though of was the one case she may never close. She has nightmares about the last time she saw her sister; when that man took her away and a curtain of guilt fell over her life. Survivor's guilt plagues Riley. She has lived her life solely to find her sister. All she wants to be is the perfect daughter her mother would never see her as. Her mother only wants her golden child back and makes sure Riley knows what a disappointment she has been in fulfilling this demand. The only thing Riley dislikes more than talking to her mother is the time between cases when she has only her incessant cycle of doubts swirling around in her head to keep her company. She's been forced into a week off to recover from the last case. A week on her own without access to FBI resources to continue her own search for her sister is not Riley's ideal vacation. She has no idea how to stop and take a breathe.<br /><br />There is one person in her life that appreciates her for more than her brilliant profiling abilities. Thayne Blackwood, a Navy Seal who came home to take care of his father but ended up taking care of his town, has been carrying on a long distant flirtation with Riley. That is about to change because his sister was kidnapped and he has asked Riley to help find her.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Get this book...not the other one that looks like this book", "text": "Sex, drugs, and rock & roll; girls, muscle cars, and muscle.  These are just a few things society says are manly pursuits.  To combat the proliferation of sex and violence in the media, a lot of books in circulation written by well-intending Christians who hope to inspire men to be true men.  But many of those books miss the mark.<br /><br />&#34;The Dude's Guide to Manhood&#34;, however, hits the bulls-eye.  If there's ever to be a best-selling book dealing with guy issues and man stuff, then this will be it.  The author, Darrin Patrick, pulls no punches and he hides behind no bushes.  He tells it like it needs to be told, but not in a condemning or condescending way. Instead, Patrick encourages and inspires with true wisdom that does not come across as being &#34;preachy&#34;.<br /><br />CONTENTS:  Twelve chapters in 170 pages tell it like it is --<br />1 - Become a Determined Man<br />2 - Become a Coachable Man<br />3 - Become a Disciplined Man<br />4 - Become a Working Man<br />5 - Become a Content Man<br />6 - Become a Devoted Man<br />7 - Become a Family Man<br />8 - The Connected Man<br />9 - The Emotional Man<br />10 - The Fighting Man<br />11 - The Heroic Man<br />12 - Living as the Forgiven Man<br /><br />There are many insights and phrases I could quote to commend this book, but there's not enough space to cover it in a short book review.  Instead, I'd prefer to ask you a few questions: &#34;How do you want to be remembered when you're gone?&#34;  &#34;When people speak about you, what will they say about your character?&#34; &#34;Before drifting off to sleep each night, what kind of character did you display that day?&#34;<br /><br />This book is about all those things that truly make great men great -- and it's not about surrounding themselves with pretty women, flashy clothes, big muscles, and expensive cars.  It's about being a role model for your sons to imitate (p.19); It's about being an employee who can be trusted and respected (p.52); It's about making your woman's character beautiful (p.78); It's about taking risks when it matters (p.90); It's about being simultaneously tough and tender (p.127).<br /><br />ITS EFFECT ON ME: There were several times when I had to put the book down and reflect upon my own life and character.  What was truly remarkable about the book is how Patrick accomplished that: he proclaimed biblical manliness without throwing the Bible at me.  Using God's truth, Patrick cut to the heart using godly principles.<br /><br />Knowing Patrick's desire for godliness AND manliness, however, I was pleased with his concluding chapters.  He wasn't content to leave his readers thinking it was just OK to one day die as a well-respected &#34;good man&#34;. Instead, I think he earns the trust of his readers by the way he presented this message through the first 10 chapters to introduce them to Jesus Christ -- the Man of men.  I think it was good timing and was presented tastefully.  Trusting the Sovereign to save, Patrick concludes the book instructing men how to live as new men -- forgiven men -- men of God.<br /><br />RATING: Without a doubt, I give &#34;The Dude's Guide to Manhood&#34; 5 stars.  I'd give 6 if it were possible, but 5 is the cut-off.  I highly recommend this book to all men for themselves and as a gift for young men.  Mom's -- pick one up as a gift for the son in your life...but be careful how you give a copy to your husband or boyfriend.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I received this book free of charge from Book Look Bloggers in exchange for my unbiased review of it.

As a woman who has miscarried and felt alone, it was somewhat of a quick connection to the author.<br /><br />There were many aspects of this book that I enjoyed. Tanika is obviously a strong Christian woman as that is evident through her words. She and her husband have been dealt much hardship through their miscarriages and have been able to see God through that.<br /><br />I was impressed with just how much scripture Tanika was able to pull into her book to relate it back to the circumstances of barrenness. Miscarried Joy was packed with God's word and it all was completely relevant, in my opinion.<br /><br />One aspect of the book that was difficult for me was that Tanika miscarried for the first time in June or July of 2015 as well as one or two times after that, however, she wrote a book within a year of that first miscarriage. I'm not saying she isn't the right person to write a book about this because she has obviously dealt with it in her personal life.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "I was disappointed in this", "text": "As a preface to my remarks - I'm a 61 year old pharmacist who met his wife while in pharmacy school in 1979. My wife works about 12 hours a week as a Kroger pharmacist plus full time at Eli Lilly's. We've been married for more than 31 years. I have worked many, many holidays (for example I've worked 25 Thanksgivings since 1982). We, according to the book, reside in lower Richistan. We own a few rental proerties close by.<br /><br />I liked the first part of the book but the longer I read the less I liked it. On page 5 the author wrote, 'The purpose of my journey isn't to take sides in this debate. I haven't set out to condemn the rich, or to turn them into heroes.'<br /><br />IMHO he ends up doing both by the end - especially if it involved Nuking the evil GOP.<br /><br />On page 38 he says that by 1890 the top 1% held about 50% of the nations wealth. On page 39 he says that was just over 20% by the late 1970's. But 1989 the number was 30% and by 2004 it was 33%.<br /><br />Obviously this % varies widely over time but he made me feel he felt that the 33% was a serious problem today.<br /><br />On page 198 he quotes Ted Gill about punishing the GOP over gay rights. But on page 194 he quotes Jared Polis, 'I think that sexual orientation, like religion or race has --nothing-- to do with ones values and to most people it's not important one way or the other'. Since these two are 1/2 of the Gang of Four in Colorado who Nuked the GOP it's interesting the author says on page 188 - 'Yet the stories of Jared Polis and Tim Gill offer another, more hopeful sign for the effect of money on politics.'<br /><br />But the author is not going to take sides? He is not against using money in politics if he being used to Nuke the GOP??<br /><br />Interesting - I doubt few people who will agree with the quote about religion, race or sexual orientation having nothing to do with ones values let alone their opinions or how they vote. IMHO more people have been killed in the name of a religion than any other reason.<br /><br />Many of the 'facts' he quotes end up being from talking to a handful of rich people who may or may not be telling the truth. If a drug company tried to get a drug approved with 'facts' like these they would never get any drug passed.<br /><br />A few comments on the middle classes problems - many traditional middle class jobs are gone or will be soon (ie - manufacturing, etc). And for a long time people were told go to college and get a degree - any degree.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many first time college students were lied to. You must (IMHO) find a degree that has long term viability as it costs the same to get a nursing education as a English degree, for example. On average the RN will have more opportunities and make more money for the same time and money cost for college. I was the 1st person on my dads side to go to college let alone graduate or get multiple degrees (I also have 2 computer degrees in addition to my pharmacy one). My 1st choice was to be a high school chemistry teacher and coach football. In fact, I probably would have been happy doing that EXCEPT I realized I wanted more money and opportunities. I didn't want to be merely be doing ok and thus changed my mind<br /><br />ALSO - many of the degrees that pay more (and have more opportunities) have fairly high failure rates (my pharmacy class started with 149 and 84 made it including a few dropping back to my class from my wife's plus a handful of transfers from other colleges). In other words only about 50% made it. But that short term pain (and boy was the competition fierce) has resulted in long term financial rewards. Of course, no one can tell the future, but you can look at long term trends (like demographics) and thus make a better decision for your own future.<br /><br />Hardly anyone wants the middle class to go bust - we should be trying to lift all boats as this what our country was built on - everyone with a little luck and hard work (and paying attention) can improve their lot in life.<br /><br />Just remember  -  the decisions you make today will shape the life you will have in the future.<br /><br />I would rate this 3.75 to 4.25 out of 10 stars. This was missed opportunity to really examine the rich and the decline of the middle class.<br /><br />SHORT UPDATE 8/16/14 - I've found that the books by Stanley (Millionaire Next Door, etc) to be more based on provable facts and much more useful in attainting my financial goals. All of the millionaires I know are closer to his presentation of the facts than this book. Anyone can achieve what I've done with hard work coupled with paying attention to what's happening in the world. If you want to be rich in a year -play the lottery. If you want to be 'rich' (at least a net worth of $1 to 2 million) by 50 or so it can be done by nearly anyone.", "images": [], "asin": "0307341453", "parent_asin": "0307341453", "user_id": "AGFI2KQRYSFBUCTGFXOUNZZQT3ZQ", "timestamp": 1381635477000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fascinating!", "text": "\"[W]hat makes _Homo sapiens_ special and why we are the only human species alive is that we evolved a few slight changes in our hardware that helped ignite a software revolution that is still ongoing at an escalating pace.\"<br /><br />Lieberman, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard, develops this apt metaphor by examining the key physical transitions that separated us from apes and then the intellectual transitions that separated us from all other hominins. Life only gets better and better for us over millions of years as we become bipeds whose increased mobility allows foraging further distances for food, those better diets then leading to bigger brains and the strategic thinking necessary for hunting, tool-making, and eventually language and social cooperation.<br /><br />Only better and better ... until a couple of cultural transitions have mixed results: the agricultural revolution's huge increase of food supply and caloric density (but: sometimes famine) and population growth (but: sometimes infectious outbreaks from living densely with animals/people); the industrial revolution's relief of brutal physical labor (but: creation of obesity and \"under-use\" diseases). He asks, \"Has civilization led the human body astray?\" and answers, in a definite affirmative, via an exploration of the mis-matches between body and environment that are responsible for the bulk of today's healthcare spending, disabilities, and deaths.<br /><br />This book is a detailed scientific exploration of how we evolved to live and how we actually do live now, connecting the dots to show why we're in epidemics of infectious disease; heart disease; autoimmune disease; obesity; type 2 diabetes; cancer; osteoporosis; and dozens more. I'm very familiar with the current situation but the evolutionary backstory here was fascinating -- logically developed, conversationally presented, extensively (and entertainingly) endnoted, and completely accessible to the non-scientist reader.

While the novel is good, it did not live up to my expectations, but I would still recommend it.  The story concerns Denny Roman at three points in her life.  We meet her at age twelve, where much of the focus in the narrative is on what happens to her mother on her 41st birthday.  We next meet Denny in her mid-twenties, as she returns to her native Ohio to sort through her things before her mother moves to New York City.  The final section of the novel takes place during Denny's mid-thirties, where she faces what could be a life-altering decision to assume responsibility for the son of a dear friend, Maureen.  The writing in What to Keep is excellent, but the novel lacks, I don't know, that little extra oomph for a five-star rating.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A horror novel that walks the thin line between literary postmodernism and genuinely scary possession (?) tale", "text": "Paul Tremblay's\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0has been greeted rapturously by not only horror fans, but by more &#34;mainstream&#34; critics, which isn't something that normally happens with horror novels. Normally, horror is a bastard stepchild of a genre, something that most reviewers are &#34;above&#34; reviewing. And in the rare cases in which a book manages to overcome that barrier, it normally does so by being so &#34;literary&#34; that it loses the very things that appeal to horror fans. All of which is to say, it's notable that\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0manages to walk a very thin line, giving us something genuinely scary and creepy, but also something inventive and postmodern enough to make it appeal to those with a more literary bent.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for Tremblay's ambition to make itself known.\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0opens with Merry Barrett returning to her childhood home, accompanied by a writer who's helping her tell the &#34;official&#34; version of her story and what happened to her sister Marjorie. See, a lot of people\u00a0know\u00a0the story already, because Merry's childhood ended up being used as a reality television series called\u00a0The Possession, a huge hit up until...well, you'll see. So what we get in\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0isn't exactly an &#34;objective&#34; account of what happened to Marjorie and the Barretts; what we're getting is mostly Merry's memories, some of which, she admits, may have been influenced by the TV show, or may be things that she's lied about for so long she's struggled to remember the truth. And if that's not enough, Tremblay throws in some blog post analyses of the episodes of\u00a0The Possession from a horror fan, discussing the story not only as it was presented on television, but picking at all of the tropes Tremblay is tossing out.<br /><br />Indeed, there's little way to explain how much\u00a0fun\u00a0this book is to horror fans without getting into the way Tremblay picks apart his own influences and inspirations. Just as you're thinking &#34;this feels like a rip from\u00a0The Exorcist&#34; or &#34;do you think anyone in this book remembers the story 'The Yellow Wallpaper'&#34;, Tremblay uses the blog posts to make the allusions and references clear, laying out for all to see the DNA of the story, but also turning the book and story into something muddier and less clear. Did all of this happen? Is this all a case of people echoing movies and TV shows that shaped their perception of what &#34;possession&#34; was? Where does the truth come in?<br /><br />To Tremblay's credit - and to the irritation of many, I bet - there aren't a lot of clear answers here.\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0leaves a lot open to interpretation, down to the final pages, which are filled with moments that might - or might not - change everything. That could be frustrating for many, but for me, Tremblay's earned his ambiguity; this is a story about how we perceive things, and how motives aren't always cut and dry. There's no arguing about the events of the story - everyone agrees on those. What's more up for debate is what it all means, and what\u00a0caused\u00a0it all - and that's far more compelling fare.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt, though, that\u00a0A Head Full of Ghosts\u00a0is genuinely scary, maybe all the more so for our inability to understand why some of this is happening. Is Marjorie mentally ill, or is she possessed? Neither explanation is entirely satisfying, because neither can adequately explain some of the truly unsettling, disturbing events of the story - even our blog posts, doing their best to unpack the tricks of the TV trade, struggle on a few points. But that's okay; what makes the best horror is a degree of uncertainty, of unease as to what's really going on. It's just that few books make that part of the text itself, filtering the story through unreliable narrator after unreliable narrator until we're not sure who to believe. (It's no coincidence that Merry shares a nickname with one of horror's great unreliable narrators,\u00a0We Have Always Lived in the Castle's Merrycat.) All we know for sure is the horror that comes out of those primal, uneasy moments - and no explanation is going to help make any more sense out of some of it.", "images": [], "asin": "B00MTSKHKO", "parent_asin": "B00MTSKHKO", "user_id": "AESESBLLG3ZZISQONG5SOAEUGC3Q", "timestamp": 1508002920960, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Short, Simple, and Beautiful", "text": "\"Rock Crystal\" is a simply amazing little book. Adalbert Stifter shows his narrative skill in starting with a description of the Austrian mountains, then moving to a description of two villages in neighboring valleys, then to two separate individuals- a shoemaker in one village and a much-sought lady in another- who eventually become married, and then to the protagonists- the couple's children- Conrad and Sanna. On Christmas Eve, they are to visit their grandmother across the mountain and be back by night. Unfortunately, there is unexpectedly heavy snow and they can't see through it and so lose their way. With not much on them except the coffee their grandmother gave them, they have to rely on Conrad's determination and whatever sign they can find from nature.<br /><br />One thing that I particularly enjoyed about \"Rock Crystal\" is how it illustrates that human life can be fragile in the face of nature.  Stifter's portrayal of the unforgiving mountains and snowstorm reminds me of the scenery in Jack London's work. Another enjoyable aspect of the book is that, despite the limited space, Stifter builds significant tension and makes the reader feel concerned for the characters; he never pulls any \"cheap tricks\" to do this, though. Finally, though religious references abound in the book, specifically Catholic liturgical ones, the story does not depend on any particular religious doctrine, and can be enjoyed simply as a story about how lucky we are to be alive.", "images": [], "asin": "159017285X", "parent_asin": "159017285X", "user_id": "AH3CRCHMK4IGCVNETUMPWN3E64FQ", "timestamp": 1254361199000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great historical read!", "text": "This is not the first Kramer book I\u2019ve read (For the Love of Armin was the other), but it\u2019s certainly the first I\u2019ve taken the time to review. Most of his books, as far as I can tell, are based around wars that defined history. With that being said, his style doesn\u2019t evolve or change much from that book to this one. It\u2019s a well-written recap of history explaining the wars with some exciting personal touches that make this book\u2019s perspective unique.<br /><br />The writing is good, though I found myself skimming when the action died down but historical books tend to lull. Overall, it was a great read. This war is one that the author himself was a part of \u2013well, the Vietnam war (which is one of 3 wars in the book).<br /><br /> If you like war stories, history, and a good weekend read, check this out.", "images": [], "asin": "107756175X", "parent_asin": "107756175X", "user_id": "AH4TB3I4XWOEMPV7233JICLTRYHA", "timestamp": 1568162414582, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
