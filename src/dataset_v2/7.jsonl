{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good Book!", "text": "Ace of Shade is a good book that takes you on a dangerous trip through the shadiest parts of the city of sin and it's a mighty fun trip to be on.<br />This book is a one that takes you on a ten day trip where the main character learns things are not what she's always thought they were. She meets up with a boy her mother said to look for if she ever was gone too long. Mischief and chaos ensue.  This is filled with schemes and trickery as well as assorted gangs and street lords. There are some very intricate storylines involving ownership of ones being in many ways and people have certain abilities they are born with that help (or hinder) them along. It's quite complicated and I don't want to go into detail because I don't want to slip and give anything away!  A slew of characters are introduced. All of the characters are quite interesting and each and everyone have such unique personalities they are fun to get to know. The set up and scenery descriptions are perfectly written so you can picture everything from the casinos to the back streets.<br />I think that as long as you can accept that this all takes place in just ten short days, which most I suppose who pick this up will be able to do, and the books synopsis sounds good to you then you should give it a shot. It's good and I have a feeling by the time more read this and more reviews are added  (it's at 70 reviews as I type this one) it will likely be a highly rated book.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "There's a saying...", "text": "You know that statement \"You can never have too much of a good thing\"? Well, you can, and whoever said that clearly never read Tim Curran.<br /><br />I realize I have praised Curran in the past, and I will still praise him for being such an original and twisted author. He writes like no one else and his stories are like no one else's. In a world where increasingly mundane authors are reaching ridiculous amounts of sales for lackluster books, there are still the underground, clever, and much more talented writers who can still pen something that isn't cookie-cutter and the same old story with different names. Thank God that Tim Curran is one of those kind of guys.<br /><br />Like \"Cannibal Corpse\", \"The Hive\" and \"Resurrection\", \"Hag Night\" is pretty much non stop. The action never relents and Curran, being the clever author that he is, always find yet another way to ramp up the violence or the suspense. He can still craft some pretty believable and like-able characters as well. And unlike his other works, you actually liked every character here...well with the exception of Megga, but then again, I think that was pretty well planed as well. The other thing that is clearly evident in all of the author's library, and shown no better than in this one, is the amount of knowledge Curran has for simple things that could otherwise be overlooked. He knows the details of old, 18th century houses, the way life was in those days, and the guy obviously knows his horror films, mentioning bizarre and B-Rated ones that only a true fan of the genre would.<br /><br />Unfortunately (and I just realized I use that word a lot), it's that originality that comes back to bite \"Hag Night.\" Curran has always been known to scribble down some pretty apt descriptions in his novels. Usually many, many, many times, over and over again. I appreciate new ways to describe things and the more crazy and outlandish the better, but sometimes Curran needs to know when to pull in the reigns a bit and just leave some of it up to our own imagination. Like I did with \"Cannibal Corpse\", I'll leave you one of his numerous examples of overwrought illustration:<br /><br />\"She saw the hunched, tenebrous form making its way amongst the moss-covered slabs and leaning headstones, gliding through the blowing snow. It had been a woman before the raves of interment, before the cold and fat dormancy of its sleep. But it was no longer a woman. It was an appetite. And this was its primary motivation, the candle that still burned and flickered in the hollow mortuary of its flesh. It glowed with an even, hungry light like a black taper seen through a frosted window. And it was this hunger that would renew it, temake it, rekindle it's pestilental spirit, transform it from a sculpture of mausoleum dust and drifting web into the semblance of a woman again.\"<br /><br />Now, I'm all for these kinda details...once in a while. Curran puts these things on every page, often times more than once. I don't know how many times the word \"pestilence\" was used, or how frequently we, the readers were told about the vampires red eyes or their desires by \"feasting on brain and organ, shearing skin and chomping down throat meat.\"<br /><br />I'm not gonna say much else about this book or its author. The details are here for you to see. All I'm going to say in closing is that you could do far, far worse in picking an author to read, but don't go for \"Hag Night\" right off the bat. Try an older one like \"Dead Sea\" or \"Biohazard.\"", "images": [], "asin": "0987476548", "parent_asin": "0987476548", "user_id": "AFLP3ICZXBEBJZ2R24EQ3HVLXPQQ", "timestamp": 1371099466000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Even at that time Morchauser's book was horrible.  Wargaming World War Two is a masterpiece in comparison.  However it has some weaknesses.  First is the title.  WWW2 doesn't cover air or naval combat. A better title would be \"A Beginner's Guide to Wargaming WW2 Ground Combat in Miniature\".  In this the book does a fair job.  If you have never played a wargame or want to start gaming this period this book is a fair start.  It explains how to pick a scale, the type of rules appropriate to the scale, how a game works, how to in general set up and write a game.  All useful.  On the other hand if you have been gaming the period this book is rather bland.  The WW2 historical background could be better as could the sample game.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Story Follows A Predictable Path", "text": "When a young woman is found dead in an affluent part of Emerson, Massachusetts, those who knew her are reluctant to talk with the police.  Eden Perry\u2019s death leads to the investigation of the lives of three teenagers who were partying with her that night. Hannah, soft spoken and filled with anxiety. Jack, rich, popular around school with the reputation of being on the edge. Christopher, always on the outside looking in. As the police hone in on one of them, the others and their parents will do anything to keep the bullseye squarely on the young suspect.  Will the truth be told or only the perception of the truth?<br /><br />Locust Lane went down the predictable path and stayed there, to my disappointment.  The author had an opportunity to change the narrative, but instead reached for the clich\u00e9.  Though the police bias was not overly explained, it was implied.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Interesting read but sloppy genealogical references", "text": "This book is worth reading if you want to learn about a period in the history of China that is rarely mentioned, a time during which two Jewish families (originally from Iraq) built incredible business empires and also suffered through some very difficult periods. Mr. Kaufman\u2019s journalistic background serves him well here in that he presents non-fiction material in a compelling way that encourages you to keep reading.<br /><br />Where the author falters, however, is in laying out the Sassoon family tree accurately. Yes, it\u2019s a big family, but records are available that indicate who was married to whom and when, who had which children and when, etc. Many people will brush off these errors and claim that accuracy in this regard doesn\u2019t impact the narrative, but when a non-fiction author makes a mistake in genealogy not just once but at least twice, and he also makes confusing references to family members, it makes me wonder what else he is muddling or presenting inaccurately.<br /><br />The sloppiness starts early, on page xi in the Cast of Characters. The author refers to Flora Sassoon (1859-1936)  as \u201cThe wife of one of David\u2019s eight sons.\u201d Why can\u2019t he specify which son? Is the information really that hard to track down? I found it without too much trouble. Understanding who the many sons are and who their children are happens to be relevant as the history of the family unfolds. The Flora born in 1859 was the wife of Solomon; Solomon was born to David and his second wife, Farha/Flora. Yes, Flora\u2019s mother-in-law was also named Flora. Many people in this family had the same name, which makes it all the more important for the references to be clear and precise.<br /><br />Then, in Chapter 1, page 7, in writing about the patriarch David, who married at age fifteen, the author writes \u201cHis wife swiftly gave birth to four sons.\u201d No, she gave birth to two sons and two daughters. This is easily verified through multiple sources which all indicate that David\u2019s first wife, Hannah, died in 1826. Six of David\u2019s eight sons were born AFTER Hannah died, so how could he have had four sons swiftly? The first two sons, Abdullah/Albert and Elias were born in 1818 and 1820 respectively. The third son, Sassoon David, was born in 1832, well after Hannah died. Sassoon David\u2019s mother was Farha/Flora, David\u2019s second wife.<br /><br />On page 104, in referring to Rachel Sassoon Beer, Kaufman says \u201cLike her cousin Flora\u2026\u201d What cousin Flora? You can\u2019t just throw in a new Flora without explaining who she was. In addition to her paternal grandmother and one of her aunts (the one married to Solomon Sassoon), Rachel\u2019s mother was named Flora. That\u2019s three Floras. Who\u2019s this other/cousin Flora? Can you see what I mean when I say the family references beg for clarification?<br /><br />Not far into Ch. 5, bottom of page 107, there is an incorrect reference to Victor Sassoon as \u201cgrandson\u201d to family patriarch, David Sassoon. Victor was David\u2019s GREAT grandson, not his grandson. Maybe this is a typo in my hardcover copy that has since been fixed?<br /><br />The book is an easy and interesting read, but shame on the author and Viking/Penguin RandomHouse for their lack of due diligence.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Warning: This is NOT Kate Daniels", "text": "Despite being a more hard-core sci-fi fan, I had read the Kate Daniels books and liked them (although Curran not so much). They were stories with well thought out plots that had a bit of romance/sex mixed in. I'd been a bit too deep in my main genre lately, and figured I'd take a break with some lighter fare from an author(s) I had read previously. I now wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Here, there is a bare hint of a plot that is slowly spooled out between all of the panting over how 'hot' the male lead, Declan, is. Other reviewers have covered the issues in greater detail, but the gist is that you have a poor, rural girl who is comically portrayed as 'spunky', when the appropriate word is 'bratty'. Regardless, the hot, aristocratic Earl continually insists that he is going to 'have her' in a stalker sort of way, despite spending most of his time criticizing her lack of education and manners.<br /><br />In other words, it's the fantasy trope of a woman being so damned irresistible to a man 'just because' that, regardless of how unsuitable she is or how much she protests that she doesn't want him, he is still so attracted to her that he would do anything to have her. The cherry on that sundae is that his feelings for her (whatever they actually are beyond pure lust is questionable) develop despite his original intentions toward her. (Yeah, I've read \"Price and Prejudice\", and this thing couldn't shine its shoes on that score.)<br /><br />I am not a modern romance novel reader, so the only authority I have to go on is other reviewers when they say that this general type of trope (supposedly spunky/independent woman swooning at the feet of a big, burly alpha-male who overwhelms her with his muscles and misogyny) is common. As those reviewers have also mentioned, it does bother me that women can be involved in this sort of thing on the one hand, either writing or reading, and then have the cognitive dissonance to be able to protest their independence on the other hand.<br /><br />So, I guess if you're a 'normal' romance novel reader, but want a slightly fantasy setting, then this might pass muster with you, despite the story not being that good. If you're looking for a good fantasy story with a little romance mixed in, then this is definitely not the book for you.<br /><br />PS: I got the Audible version of the book, and literally broke out laughing, and I mean out LOUD, when they finally get down to doing the deed.

Still (fresh from reading it over a 36 hour period), I can't find too much to hate about it. Possibly because Child has given us a new glimpse into Reacher's past that helps us to understand the antihero's POV. And maybe because there's the classic Reacher monstrous villain (Little Joey). Or maybe it's because we get to see Reacher finally using an iPad or texting. Overall, the stakes seem big, but this ends up being a smaller Reacher story. A &#34;Personal&#34; problem (bad dum shh!) Perhaps that's why I didn't mind the fact that he had secret agents, satellite images, and private jets at his disposal to solve this conflict.

However, let me say that it amazes me that the excellent writer who gives us the wonderful JP Beaumont series can turn around and write something as abysmal as this. Granted, her Joanna Brady series, although fun, also lacks the quality of the Beaumont series, which makes me think that maybe Jance should not be writing female characters.<br /><br />Okay, first of all, within the first 10 pages I discovered two continuity errors that slipped by the editors. And I found more than a few typos throughout the book. So count sloppy editing as one strike against the book. Second, the plot itself lacks cohesion. Okay, veteran newscaster Alison Reynolds gets bounced from her job because she is too old. Her stupid husband of 7 years, who is a network bigwig, gets mad because she intends to pursue legal action against the TV station. But that's okay because she suddenly learns that her husband is a real sleazebag and has been cheating on her for years so she files for divorce.<br /><br />But then her best friend from high school goes mysteriously missing and then is found dead, an apparent suicide after receiving a diagnosis of ALS. And although she hasn't seen her friend in at least 2 years, her friend's small children consider her their best friend and unburden themselves to her. And her friend's husband is also a sleazebag who was sleeping around.<br /><br />But the police don't think the death of the friend is suspicious and are happy to accept it as a suicide. And in the meantime, Alison's college-aged, and too wonderful to be true son, sets her up as a blogger, and her blog immediately attracts a huge audience. The topics on her blog roam the gamut from quack treatments for ALS to spousal abuse to scumbag husbands to the stupidity of the TV station for firing her.<br /><br />I could go on- I've only touched the surface of the iceberg in hitting at some of the various plot points (there are more). However, here's my down and dirty summation-- if you want to read a book that hops from one discordant plot point to another and never has any cohesion and expects you to suspend belief on every single page- hey, this is the book for you. However, if that doesn't interest you, find one of Jance's Beaumont books.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Good story, interesting setting -- NOT for those who do not care for: rape, torture, etc.", "text": "When I was much younger (in high school) I liked this series a lot. I made it all the way up to #6, Faith of the Fallen. At the time, I was able to ignore the hyper-violence, and the rapes, and how women were treated, and I was completely oblivious to the author's worked-in messaging about conservative dogma. I was able to enjoy the story as a story.  As I have gotten older though, I have come to realize the messaging of the book is wrong for me, and the glorification of the violence done to men and women in the book, is not something I can read for entertainment, and certainly not something I can support.<br /><br />The first book is especially violent (when you encounter a character named Denna, brace yourself). The first book spends a lot of time establishing the setting world, and the rules of the world (additive and subtractive magic, ancient evils, etc.). The story itself, taken on its own merits, is fairly good. It has an uncovering-the-magical-past vibe to it that is fairly gripping. The rest of the books are equally violent (one of the punishments inflicted on captured women by an invading army is to \"pass them around in the tents\" for the soldiers to \"use\" -- and yes, it is as bad as that sounds.  The entire series is EXTREMELY violent, and consists of the most vile and horrifying type of violence.  To this day I remember some of the scenes I read with chills.  The series also spends a lot of time harping on conservative ideas such as rape victims shouldn't choose abortion if they get pregnant as a result of the rape, and that private property and capitalism are THE way to go. (Not that I disagree with the free-market as a general rule, just making a point that the author makes this a big focus in the series -- ESPECIALLY in Faith of the Fallen).<br /><br />After the first book ... it just gets horrifying. There are numerous rapes of men and women (and attempted rapes). There is violence against women in general, torture (in detail, such as flaying the skin from a live victim), and other very adult, very dark, very unpleasant descriptions and story points. I want to make a point of emphasizing that they are STORY POINTS. They aren't scenes. In the first book, the male protagonist (Richard) is captured and spends a LARGE portion of the book being tortured and violated, etc. It isn't just a brief scene, it goes on for a LARGE part of the book, and the author makes every effort to try to make the reader sympathetic to the point of view of the attacker.<br /><br />The fantasy story itself is interesting, and if you can get past the rapes (which are so common, it would almost be comical, if it wasn't so horrifying) and general ugliness of the world the story is set in, then you may like this series. I, myself, only made it through the books I did due to my young age, and lack of a proper frame of reference.  As an adult, I cannot stomach them anymore. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to \"skip the bad parts\" because they are THAT laced with them.<br /><br />Like I said, the story itself and the world it is set in, is very good. You will like the story and want to know what happens next, if and only if you can overlook the negative points I have brought up in this review.<br /><br />2 stars if those negative points mean the same to you that they do to me. 4 or 5 stars if they don't.", "images": [], "asin": "0765362643", "parent_asin": "0765362643", "user_id": "AEBJB6KW2UBHRYWYXDLYKPIE5O2Q", "timestamp": 1341431152000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Terrific idea, but I wish it was executed better", "text": "I love thoughtful and intelligent Christian fiction, so I was excited by the premise of this book and the rest of Kingdom series.  It promised to be a Pilgrim\u2019s Progress type of allegory, that paralleled events from Genesis to Revelation.  But would it deliver?<br /><br />In the first book, Kingdom\u2019s Dawn, we meet the main characters Leinad and Tess.  After peril arrives when his parents accept gifts from Lucius, they eventually find themselves in slavery, just like Israel in Egypt.<br /><br />The connections with Biblical characters and events in this story are mostly obvious.  Payton & Denin represent Adam and Eve, while other characters drawn from the Bible include Gabrik (angel Gabriel), Lord Fairos (Pharaoh).  Leinad (which is \u201cDaniel\u201d spelled backwards), represents several individuals in the first book, namely Seth, Noah, Abram, Joseph and Moses.  Arrethrae is Terra Earth spelled backwards, and this technique is used for several names (Benreu = Reuben, Eminafs = Famine), and the Vactor Deluge parallels the Great Flood.  And if you can\u2019t figure the connections for yourself, the back of the book has some commentary explaining everything, including the significance of Cedric (believers from Peter to present), Tess (faithful remnant that believes prophets), and of course Leinad (Old Testament prophets from Seth to Malachi).<br /><br />Does it work?  Sadly I don\u2019t think so.  I enjoy thoughtful allegory, but it needs to be done carefully and well, and that\u2019s not the case here.  The comparisons are just too obvious, that it no longer is a story of its own.  What\u2019s more, the allusions to Biblical characters and events are often cheesy, the use of reversed names being a case in point.  Cheesy dialogue like \"good morning sunshine\" clashes with serious subject matter.  At one point Leinad and Tess hug, and it all feels more like a cheap romance, rather than a serious story.  There are questions and answers at the end, which encourage you to engage with the ideas being allegorized, but these only serve to show that the story can\u2019t really speak for itself, but needs commentary.<br /><br />To the author\u2019s credit, he appears to have used a thesaurus to include some big words.  But quite frankly he\u2019s not a strong writer, and he often makes the mistake of telling us what happens, rather than describe and show it.  As a result there is no sense of immersion in the story, and it\u2019s just poor story-telling at best.<br /><br />In the end, the concept is clever, but it\u2019s just poorly executed.  Unfortunately the story often seems overly childish and cheese, and lacks real literary value, despite the attempt to allegorize important truths.  The result is that it diminishes and cheapens the important spiritual message it is trying to communicate.  Sadly, this is a bad example of Christian fiction, I won\u2019t be reading any more in this series, and can\u2019t recommend it.  Instead, read the Narnia Chronicles or Pilgrim\u2019s Progress.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Needed More Story than Build Up", "text": "Crystal Bones by C. Aubrey Hall is the second of the Marshall Cavendish books I was sent to review.  It is the first of a trilogy of teen fantasy novels featuring the half fae twins Diello and Cynthe.  It is also, again, aimed at a younger audience.<br /><br />It all starts the night before the twins' thirteenth birthday when Diello hears a voice in the storm calling his mother.  This is, of course, foreshadowing into their parents' deep dark past, as mentioned in the blurb.  Diello is then disappointed when his father gives him a useful gift for his birthday rather than the traditional fun present and both twins are sent out to do their chores unlike any previous birthday they've had. The first few chapters seem to be pretty well dedicated to reminding the reader that growing up sucks.  There are however magic herbs in the morning milk which apparently get the fae either high or drunk and the fair is that day.  But they're told not to go because of the dangers of being around humans.  It follows that an errand for their mother leads them right into the thick of the fair and straight towards danger!  The deck is stacked against our heroes, will they survive and figure out the mysteries surrounding their parents' pasts or are they doomed to failure?<br /><br />I'm going to say right off the bat that I got caught up in Crystal Bones about halfway through, where the meat of the story started.  Up until then had been mostly lead up, background, and foreshadowing which, while necessary to the overall plot, wasn't particularly different from any other coming of age fantasy novel that I've read.  There were also some points where it felt like Cynthe could have been omitted from the book, while both twins were billed as the heroes in the blurb it  is very much Diello centric.  She does get some moments of awesomeness but, all told, could have been removed in favor of making Diello a bit more three dimensional. Hall also seems to think that if humans hating half fae isn't mentioned every time the twins run into a human the reader will forget.  This leads to a ton of fantasy racism which can make the book a bit hard to read at times.  Crystal Bones gets better as it goes, once I got to the meat of the story I was hooked.  Unfortunately it also cuts off rather abruptly in an almost painful sequel hook, leaving a rather unsatisfying ending and a year long wait to find out what happens.<br /><br />As a final note before I rate it, Crystal Bones seems to be Hall's first novel so I'm sure that most of the kinks will be worked out for the second book.  It's also worth noting that, any issues aside, I did enjoy the book it's just that most of what I enjoyed probably constitutes spoilers and I don't want to ruin anything for other readers.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "\"She is lying dead...her poor body crashed through the glass porch. She will never speak again in this life.\"", "text": "\"The Passing Of Charles Lanson\" by Louis Tracy (1863-1928) starts off with an attack on the beat copper Constable Barker while he is doing his rounds for the Derbyshire County constabulary of Sleaford, and during the attack, he's almost killed, twice.  To investigate the crime we are introduced to Superintendent Wood who, a local copper who will stay with us throughout the novel.<br /><br /> Proving that it never rains, it pours, so while investigating Barker's attack, Wood gets word that the great and influential finacial investor Charles Lanson has been murdered, stabbed in his study at his Sleaford Castle estate.  Enter into the investigation comes Dr. Macgregor, a Scotsman whose dodgy accent comes and goes at a whim.  Accompanying Macgregor and Wood to investigate Lanson's murder is the ace detective James Winter, Chief Superintendent of the New Scotland Yard.<br /><br /> The reader will soon get a whiff of the supernatural as we are also introduced to Charles' daughter Irene, a young woman who is subject to neurasthenia, and at time goes into trances, and seems to be able to channel the castle's long dead occupants.  Unfortunately, this is a plotline that goes nowhere, at least, until the end of the novel.<br /><br /> As the castle is searched, and the staff questioned, Irene's maid Alice Romer, has disappeared, only to be found draped unconscious across some turret steps.  What was she doing up there, and why is she unconscious?<br /><br /> Then as the novel progresses we will meet Deputy Inspector, and friend of Winter, Mr. Charles F. Furneaux who comes across as mixture of Colombo and Nick Charles, and his scenes with Winter are near priceless.<br /><br /> However, this is a serial novel, published in six parts in \"Argosy\" in 1924, and so, a story that could, and should, have wrapped up in a hundred pages or so is stretched to over three hundred.  Now, while it is true that the beginning is fairly good, and the last sixth is very good indeed, everything else in between, except for the interplay between Winter and Furneaux, just moves as slower than molasses in January.<br /><br /> Another problem is that this is an extremely wordy novel, so it is straddled with some very clumsy, and very formal, prose.  This wordiness however has none of the stylishness that can often go with such writing.  As one reads some of the bloated prose, and opinionated soliloquies, that make up this novel, I could actually see the author racking up the word count.<br /><br /> Now, some of this may just may be me, and maybe British pulp thrillers of this era were commonly written as such, but I still don't have to think such writing as good.  It's this style of writing that is another thing that dates \"The Passing Of Charles Lanson\".  A good example of the clumsy prose that can be found within Tracy's novel is \"I've known a crazy woman have full command of what she called her senses after swallowing twelve doses of bromide . . . \"<br /><br /> There is also a lot of casual racism directed towards Greeks, some of it is complementary, and a lot of it is paternalistic.<br /><br /> What I noticed after reading this novel is that police procedurals have really changed over the years.  Most of this novel, about three quarters of it, takes place over a twenty-four hour period, and through all of the melodrama, the palace intrigues, and the initial investigation, Charles Lanson is taken upstairs to cool and ripen like an old piece of fruit.  Even more, important evidence is just left lying about in the murder room.  Then Inspector Furneaux is given leave in the middle of the investigation to gallivant to Greece, and to accept some money slipped to him by one of the suspects.  And, sadly, once Furneaux is gone, the interplay between him and Winter essentially stops, and the novel sinks into the mundane again.<br /><br /> Anyway, I'm glad I read it, but if it could have been condensed down to a hundred page novella, some of the dull wordiness had been eliminated, and some of the characters had been more interesting, I would have given this novel a higher rating.  As is, this book is only recommended for pulp, British pulp, and British mystery completests, and even then, only if you can get it cheap.<br /><br /> For this site I have reviewed these other period fictions:<br /><br />Asterisk Club #1:  [[ASIN:0915230887 The Wooden Overcoat]] by Pamela Branch.<br />[[ASIN:B000K09H8G At The Mountain of Madness and other tales of terror]] by H.

I enjoyed this collection. I didn\u2019t like it as much as III so it gets a lower rating. The poems deal with the same themes as III and some of them are effective, hard-hitting and emotional. Rin explores themes found repeated multiple times in contemporary poetry: love, loss and heartache. Very little new can be said about these themes but Sin manages it a few times. However, some of the poems didn\u2019t work for me especially the ones describing how a woman feels engaging with the world. These were very clich\u00e9. At times I felt some of the poems were too short and lacked depth, so short I\u2019d hasten to call them poems at all.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Neighbors", "text": "In so many ways Ed Andrews' personal story of mortgage disaster was both more and less than I expected. Busted: Life Inside the Great Mortgage Meltdown presents the embarrassing story of a New York Times economic reporter's personal financial and personal crises of the last few years. One would expect that an educated and informed person would have averted predatory loans and would not have spent so far beyond one's means, but we humans are complicated, and Andrews' story is like that of many others. He divorced, and faced increased expenses by adding his own housing expenses. He remarried, and his costs increased further. Both he and his new wife were reckless with spending and never quite found a productive way of talking about money and spending. For readers who love schadenfreude, Busted will be very satisfying. For fans of reality television, this print version of Cribs might be entertaining. For any reader who wonders about what kind of people get themselves into financial muddles, Andrews and his wife offer some answers but little sympathy because of their selfishness, immaturity and overall recklessness.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Himmmming and Hawwwwwing", "text": "I must say that when I saw the reviews for this book I was upset.  I really wanted Sophia and Deck to get together.  I mean, that's how Brockmann set it up.  I had received the book the day before I read the reviews.  I was furious that Brockmann decided to change the tide.  I wanted to return the book immediately.  Well, I got distracted and didn't get to the book for a few days and so I got over my initial anger.<br /><br />Well, I ended up reading the book.  I can't say I wasn't disappointed.  Although Brockmann made a good effort of rearranging everything we had hitherto read about Deck, Sophia, and Dave I was left feeling kind of blah.  Yeah, the way she wrote it went okay, but the fact that she changed our perception of Deck, Tracy, Dave and Sophia by rearranging their personalities didn't fly true with me.  I couldn't get over waiting for Dave to do something completely geeky or for Tracy to do something completely dumb blondish.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that Brockmann chose to represent the characters one way in previous books, then changed their characters to show different personalities. I realize it is a work of fiction, but the reason most of us read these types of books is for the realism that is represented.  When things go way beyond reality (i.e. completely changing your IQ and personality), the book and author loses credibility.<br /><br />Does this mean I will no longer read Brockmann books?

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "It was just....OK!", "text": "If you are a Patterson Lover, and have not grown tired of the \"I am Alex Cross and all my friends are either crazed killers who I am tracking and don't know it...or I have a ton of problems and yet still manage to solve the crime\"...this tale is for you. After a much needed break [I had decided that I needed to give Alex Cross a little rest and enjoy some of Patterson's other works,like the winged people....now that was interesting and I enjoyed it] I picked up in the series where I left off....Big Bad Wolf. Unfortunately, after reading it I felt a little out of sorts and had to ask myself the question...\"just what do I think of this novel?\" I really had to search within myself and decide what was it that I just didn't get? Or is it that I got it, but wasn't sure if I liked it?<br /><br />Well for starters we still have the ever present Alex Cross, who has left the DC PD and decided to go Federal (FBI);then there's \"Mama Nana\" or whatever he calls his mother, who quietly states the obvious;his friend, Sampson who makes a cameo appearance and states that he is expecting a child; his absent girlfriend (Jamilla) who appears to be a little too mysterious for my taste at first, but appears periodically throughout the thriller (encouraging phone calls no less, hope she doesn't turn out to be a killer); Kyle (his psychotic ex-friend who use to work for the FBI); and a few others. Patterson also introduces new characters, like Monty (FBI computer expert, single with kids) and Mahoney (an eager partner who loves the excitement of having a partner who is willing to think out of the box....so I am sure he will either ultimately be killed or be the crooked FBI agent that is being paid off by the Wolf).  Unfortunately, most of my rating is based solely on the love I have for Patterson's creativity and not so much about my love of the book. Although there was A LOT of potential (I loved the mystery surrounding who the Wolf really is) it was a little confusing. Patterson spent the first have of the novel introducing a sadistic, kidnapping couple and killed them early on. He introduced a concept of white slavery among the rich...which was interesting, but then it seemed forced by introducing so many other \"bad things\" that the wolf was involved in....it just all seemed a little FORCED. Oh and another thing, because I am not in love with the character of Alex's baby's mother, Christine, I did not enjoy her reappearance after being absent for over a year. I didn't care about her as a character and wondered why she was coming back. It just seemed that while Alex was trying to solve his first case while joining the FBI, he just didn't need the drama surrounding his exgirlfriend's decision to claim their son. Of course I know, and you will too when and if you complete it, that the whole book is set up for the sequel, but I am not sure that I want to read it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Magnificent book, absolutely horrible edition", "text": "If I were to list the favorite books of my life time of reading -- a list that would include many thousand books -- &#34;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&#34; would be either first or second, vying with Henry Roth's incredible &#34;Call it Sleep&#34;.  Bottom line,  I love this book -- have read it (and listened to it) at least eight or nine times and I'm not done yet.  It's my turn-to book when I want the comfort of reading something I know I love.<br /><br />So why two stars?  I bought this particular book for a young friend who doesn't read all that much - she's the &#34;Why are you giving me a book?  I already have one&#34; kind of person.  But I thought that if ever there was a book that would hook her from the first page, that she would glory in, identify with, day in, day out, this would be it.

The book itself is very thick  -- which I personally love, but which scared the bejesus out of my young friend.  But compounding that, the print is SO TINY!!  Why would a publisher do that?  Put WIDE margins on the pages, and make the print so small even I  -- 20-20 vision! -- had to struggle with it?<br /><br />The result?  It's an intimidating-looking book: so many pages, such little bitty tiny small print. If I'd SEEN this edition myself, I'd never have bought it for my friend -- I could see right away that this would look was too formidable for a non-compulsive reader, no matter how good the story itself was.<br /><br />Too bad, too bad.  I still think this is a great &#34;intro&#34; book for a person who hadn't yet acquired the reading bug, but most definitely not this edition. There are a lot of different editions out there -- pick one of them that LOOK inviting.  An edition that has a picture or something on the cover -- AND the traditional back-cover blurb about what this story is all about, something else this edition lacks.<br /><br />If anyone could make &#34;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&#34; look uninviting, this publisher managed it.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A personal political diatribe or a relevant medical-political thriller? You decide.", "text": "Michael Palmer died unexpectedly a few months ago in October of 2013. \u201cResistant\u201d is the author\u2019s twentieth and final novel. It stands alone, but it\u2019s the third book in the author\u2019s Dr. Lou Welcome series. The novel was complete and at the publisher before he died.<br /><br />I was curious to read his final novel. In the past, I\u2019d enjoyed the rich medical details, tight plotting, suspense, and intrigue of his earlier works. The author\u2019s untimely death saddened me and reawakened my interest in his work. I was curious how his writing might have changed over the years. I knew that he was a skilled commercial storyteller of unapologetically formulaic medical thrillers. It was a genre that has always held my interest, but lately, there seemed to be so many new and talented writers in this arena, I had no time or interest to return to Michael Palmer. Not until now.<br /><br />What I discovered immediately about this Lou Welcome series is that the author had branched out into a crossover genre half way between political and medical thrillers. The novel is still packed with his signature, testosterone-filled action, suspense and medical detail, but there is a major controversial political issue at its core. It\u2019s the same issue that\u2019s currently dividing our Nation. If you\u2019re on the liberal side of this issue, this book may please you. If you\u2019re on the conservative side, it will probably make you angry. Whatever side you\u2019re on, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recognize that the politics at its core is a gross distortion that adds nothing to the political debate.<br /><br />\u201cResistant\u201d is about a small clandestine group of ultra-fanatic right-wing conservatives. They call themselves the Society of One Hundred Neighbors. They came into existence in the era of FDR and Ayn Rand. Currently, they exist to rid the United States of all entitlement programs (especially Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) and free the country from what they see as the death grip of bankrupting debt. They\u2019re prepared to go to any ends necessary to achieve their goal, including biological terrorism. Their new weapon is the Janus bacterium, a germ very similar to streptococcus pyogens, the flesh-eating bacteria that causes necrotizing fasciitis. They\u2019ve unleashed the pathogen in target hospitals around the country. The government is managing the crisis in secret to contain public panic. The government calls the terrorist weapon the Doomsday Germ. The trouble is, the bacteria have gotten the upper hand. They\u2019re mutating. The Society\u2019s new antibiotic agent can no longer contain them.<br /><br />So how does the author\u2019s main character, Dr. Lou Welcome, get involved in the crisis and manage to be at the focal point of its resolution? Well, you\u2019ll have to read the book to find out, but I assure you: the plot is utterly unbelievable. But heck, this is supposed to be blockbuster commercial fiction. It may be over-the-top and downright silly in parts, but it kept me reading and entertained. Despite the ugly political distortions and exaggerated two-dimensional characters, I felt there was enough decent commercial fiction, suspense, and tension to earn it at least three stars.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I reread a few Michael Palmer obituaries and was stunned to realize how much Lou Welcome mirrors the author\u2019s own personal real life story. Both Dr. Lou Welcome and Dr. Michael Palmer had early careers as emergency room doctors; both men became addicted to pain killers, drugs, and alcohol and, partially as a result, lost their beloved wives to divorce; both men were disciplined by the medical profession and ended up serving in a volunteer capacity for a physicians-wellness organization assisting medical personnel with their substance abuse problems; both men eventually went into private practice in internal medicine. But the resemblance ends there. Lou Welcome is, of course, younger, brighter, stronger, more athletic, a greater risk taker, a more loyal friend, a more supporting father, etc. You get the picture? Lou Welcome is a fictional hero; he\u2019s also, certainly, Michael Palmer\u2019s tailor-made alter ego.<br /><br />As a medical doctor with a long history of substance abuse and recovery, Michael Palmer has been quoted as saying that he started writing suspense thrillers as a type of long-term personal therapy. \u201cWhen it comes to writing,\u201d he said, \u201cI loved the feeling of being in control when my life was not.\u201d Well, none of us are in control of the current political debate that is dividing our Nation. I\u2019m sure no matter which side you\u2019re on, you\u2019re probably immensely frustrated with your inability to control the situation. Obviously in this, his last book, Palmer was able to craft a plot that allowed him to not only be the heroic star of his own fictional world, but also a man capable of slaying his own private political dragon. I\u2019m sure he derived a great deal of satisfaction writing this book. You decide if you will enjoy reading it.<br /><br />Personally, I\u2019m pleased I read it. If nothing else, it gave me a glimpse of psychological insight into the real-life author behind the book.<br /><br />Dr. Michael Palmer, may you rest in peace along with your alter ego, Dr. Lou Welcome.", "images": [], "asin": "1250030927", "parent_asin": "1250030927", "user_id": "AGJKEO7CAVS472K2352YHRZEL2JA", "timestamp": 1394165401000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Perhaps suitable for entry level engineers?", "text": "It may be suited for entry entry level engineers, and they find it an interesting read.  I didn't learned anything, I am afraid, and was irritated at times when I disagreed with authors opinion that was being passed off as facts.<br /><br />What bothered me the most is the lack of rigor, for instance, he advocates for incremental design which costs 10-20% and if you don't it will make you 10%-20% slower after some point.  The only motivation a graph with no units.  It may matter if is 10% or 20%, as that is after all a factor of 2.  Also, it's not really clear that once in a while 10% investment, let's call it 45 minutes is a very different cost than a recurring daily 45 minute overhead due to cost being a mess.  I don't have any data to dispute the numbers, btw, but on the other hand, I have not seen any studies to support it either, and the author does not tell us where he is getting this from.<br /><br />His advise of avoiding lots of small functions as it means you will be bouncing all over the place to understand the code is not necessarily wrong.  It adds lots of boiler plate, for example. Using an argument from the book itself, however, you could argue that good names and comments would mean you didn't need to read those lower level functions.  The counter argument is that smaller functions are much easier to unit test.  Then you have the unit test vs integration test discussion of course.<br /><br />There are 3 chapters on comments.  Why?!  I am towards the \"good code is self-documenting\" end of the spectrum, although I would  say a lot of comments is often (but certainly not always) a code smell that suggest refactoring using better names, extracting code to function etc.  I do like how he describes good comments as either lower or higher level than the code.<br /><br />The text editor example that runs through most of the book becomes trite.  What I find way more interesting is when he talks about his experience with TCL (design mistakes, or the benefits derived from unit test suite), or towards the end RAMCloud and a specific implementation detail.", "images": [], "asin": "1732102201", "parent_asin": "1732102201", "user_id": "AFK7JPICHY4ESH4IJ4IBK2JEMB3A", "timestamp": 1536726866598, "helpful_vote": 53, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Ok but a little slower", "text": "Oddly there are very few biblical fiction books that take place during biblical times or involve people of the Bible.  It must be Amish fiction sells too well.  That or authors seem to be nervous of being termed heretics.<br /><br />With the first Noah book I enjoyed (Grade - B) and I like Chaffey's writing.  Noah feels like a real person.  He goes through character development. You understand his feelings and motivation.  All the things you're supposed to do in a story. In this book, we pick back up with Noah from his just married happy ending.  Oh and running away from the crazy princess who loves snake gods.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Noah is written as being more of a leader and husband and friend.  There are a lot of his personal aspects that are enjoyable to read.  He also faces doubt and indecisiveness at times.  Since we know the end story, this growth of Noah is really nice to see.  He's not perfect and he's not holier-than-thou.  The supporting cast of characters is interesting with Noah's friends being well written and sees Noah as a leader of the group.  However, it's not like the hang on his every word and always need to be around him.  There's a character who kind of gets a hero's speech in the middle of the book and it was nice that a supporting character could have that spotlight.  The plot makes sense of where it's going and there are some neat highpoint scenes that are fun to read.<br /><br />What the story had working against it was time factors.  We Noah leads a long life but the jump in years of hundreds is really a big thing to do.  This isn't like a character needing to advance in age by \"5 years later\" to get to their next plot point.  Nothing happened of note to Noah in the 600 year time gap?  On the other end of the spectrum, there is a lot of meandering plotting that happens.  Some of this is the result of the slow travel by boats but there is a lot of travel to one place then back home and then back to the one place again and then off to a side trip.  Noah's wife also feels like just a side character with kind of the normal thinking you'd probably guess she would have.  It would have been interesting to have her challenging Noah's ideas or turning Noah to a correct understanding of God's character.  She not a bad character but she just falls into a normal side character.  The villains also aren't that well presented.  It's the typical villains get power and so now they act crazy growth.  It would have been neat to see pagan leaders develop the system of worship without being on the verge of madness and show that while the evil is growing to show the need for the Flood, they are people.  They feel more like bad guy archetype characters than characters who are bad.<br /><br />Overall, a decent read with some slow parts in the middle and some location changes that happen quickly that I'm not sure how certain characters get to where they're at.  But with the knowledge that the Flood is coming, we know not all these characters can be with us for long and some neat plot points make it a good read and will want to continue the journey.

A quick read about a Halloween hotspot that turns deadly, you get gruesome deaths, a menacing masked murderer, angsty final girls and a quiet town rocked by tragedy. It\u2019s straight-forward without much depth, but neither are any of our favorite horror films or books centered on the concept of a night of terror. I came for the scares, the screams and the quick pacing and Ihli delivered.<br /><br />The book gives us multiple perspectives from a victim, a group of girlfriends and the killer. Many of our characters are angsty teens\u2014 emotional and horny and up to such antics like brooding over boys, drinking and gossiping. Given the slasher formula, they are doomed. A couple of them have their head on a bit straighter than others\u2014including Norah, who is grieving her brother\u2019s death. It\u2019s fun to predict who may or may not survive. We also get into the head of our killer. I don\u2019t always love when this happens because I think it takes the scare factor down a notch. Once we are in his head it humanizes him and he becomes less scary. I loved the concept of a haunted forest/camp site turned deadly.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Maybe a Little Too Wholesome", "text": "After reading \"A Brilliant Night of Stars and Ice\" (2022) by this author whom I'd never read anything or heard of before now, I was looking forward to enjoying this book, one of her earlier works which was published in 2018. However, this weak plot was all wrapped up by chapter 14 (there are 21 chapters total) and by that point, for this reader, this book was very much over. This is the first in what is supposed to be a fun, lighthearted even whimsical series about a group of single women who get married off, one by one.<br /><br />It did start off promising.<br /><br />A large group of mostly forgettable single women, way past their expiration date for the time period in which it is set, 1815, London England who publish articles about their experiences in the local papers. Except for the main heroine of this novel, Georgiana Allen (Georgie) all of her single friends and fellow Spinsters \"with a capital S\" were hard to root for or follow thanks to all the stereotypes this book couldn't seem to get away from. There's a \"shy\" spinster, a \"play the field having too much fun to commit\" spinster, a \"plain and homely\" spinster...You get it. And it seemed on every single page one of these women was either: scoffing, smirking, hiding a laugh in her sleeve, choking back a laugh, groaning, snorting or huffing as they discussed their single state with each other, the lack of eligible men and usually doing so with the only male character of any importance in this book, Captain Anthony Sterling. Naturally, Tony is your typical romantic novel male who never looked at another woman in his life until he saw our heroine.<br /><br />One of Tony's friends wants him to break up the Spinsters, they are throwing off the groove of all the carefree bachelors who don't want to settle and commit. These wholesome women must be stopped! If Tony were to get into their inner circle, get the ringleader Georgie to fall in love with him, then all the eligible maidens in Society would again be fair game for the single men to pursue without the cynical, rain-on-our-parade influence of these old maids who, nevertheless, hold a place of general respect in upper-class Society with their opinions and articles. Not a bad story idea by the author but even a 21st century reader knows such women have NEVER held such a place in culture or society. Childless women who have never married achieve their fame by CHOOSING such a life, which was unheard of in 1815 and these women are most certainly NOT single and childless by choice. They just haven't found a husband yet and are the victims of skewed numbers in the dating circles of their day. Even today, such women never make headlines, are treated like second-class citizens and largely ignored and forgotten by everyone. I'm speaking from personal experience here.<br /><br />This explains why this book by an LDS author was NOT published by Deseret Book or Covenant like \"Brilliant Night\" was. Not sure exactly why, maybe because of the weak plot and story idea, maybe the fact one character dropped the forbidden \"D\" word, the only place in the book I noticed while reading-sorry I can't find the reference. Or perhaps when Georgie and Tony realized they couldn't swipe left and hold out for their nine or ten to come along and decided to get together that they couldn't stop sneaking off into corners to steal kisses and passionate embraces. Nothing offensive, don't worry it was all good, clean wholesome fun but, again, just not as well written as \"Brilliant Night\" which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Pick this up if you need something to read but I recommend waiting for this author's next book to come out as published and edited by more professional houses than the one this came from.", "images": [], "asin": "1943048533", "parent_asin": "1943048533", "user_id": "AHAFU3RWXWOER3FFHPVAEE22IZFQ", "timestamp": 1676395711397, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "I knew I'd love this book.  I was wrong", "text": "When this book arrived I rushed to my bookcase to pull down my 1922 edition of The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book.  It was a slightly newer version than the one this book was based on, but I still expected that it would be fun to read Fannie's Last Supper and compare it with my disintegrating copy of the cook book, imagining what it would be like to put together a dinner party with recipes from 1896.  I should have left Fannie on the shelf and taken several other, newer cookbooks instead.<br /><br />It was a few days before I figured that out, though.  I started by reading from the beginning, at the author's story of buying an 1859 Victorian bowfront in Boston.  It was, apparently, not a pleasant place to live, with drug dealers on the sidewalk and a working girl with a customer in the neighbor's doorway.  The author confronted drug dealers, got ripped off by neighborhood children, and joined a historical society, and his family was robbed at gunpoint and attended a gay wedding, though not at the same time.<br /><br />All this might make an interesting book, and if I had wanted to read about relocating to South Boston in the 1990s I might have enjoyed it.  Eventually I got to the first recipe, Victoria Punch, \"courtesy of Donald Friary\", who is \"an expert on punch and punch bowls and a fellow member of Boston's St. Botolph Club\".  This was a bit of a surprise since Fannie Farmer had 15 punch recipes, including one for Victoria Punch which has nothing in common with Friary's.  But Friary's recipe looks far less sweet and contains ingredients which would probably be easier to find, so perhaps that's the reason for the substitution.<br /><br />The next chapter introduces Fannie Farmer a bit.  \"For starters, she was middle-class at best,\" it begins.  Apparently poor Fannie could not have afforded a membership in St. Botolph Club, even if women had been permitted to join in her lifetime.  We are, however, assured of Kimball's standing, since later in this chapter he discusses cooking dinner with his good friend Julia Child.  One of the two recipes in this chapter, Brown Bread, is based on a Fannie Farmer recipe.  The other recipe, Champagne Mignonette (to be served with oysters) has no source that I can find, but doesn't appear in my copy of the Cook Book.<br /><br />While several other recipes seem to rely on cookbooks published at a point in time near Fannie Farmer's cookbook, such as Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire, other sources include The Joy of Cooking and Gordon Ramsay.  Salmon is grilled, a method not even mentioned in the Cook Book.  The one common element throughout the book seems to be a certain level of scorn for Fannie Farmer.  \"What she may have lacked as a talented cook she made up for with a keen sense of showmanship, marketing, and giving the public what it wanted.\"<br /><br />I admit that a big part of my problem with this cookbook is that I could not get past my expectations of \"Two Years, Twelve Courses, and Creating One Amazing Meal from Fannie Farmer's 1896 Cookbook\".  It took me a few days to read most of the book, and two years to convince myself to pick it up again and read the last two chapters.  Many parts of the book are quite enjoyable, especially the discussion of handling foods that modern cooks rarely use, like the calf's head.  If the book had been marketed as a study of cookbooks from that time period (and if current sources had not been used,) I would have enjoyed it a great deal more.", "images": [], "asin": "1401323227", "parent_asin": "1401323227", "user_id": "AFQDVDIKXVY4J5IGKO4LSDS3DYPA", "timestamp": 1337717270000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Too little about Chris, too much about other people...", "text": "I was hoping that this book would be entirely about Chris McCandless, but a huge portion of it was about the author's own personal life, the lives of McCandless' relatives and friends, and other travelers who the author compares to McCandless. I didn't want to read about other people, I wanted Chris's story. And what we actually get of his story is fascinating and riveting. I just wish we got more of it.<br /><br />I was also perplexed by how many times we got references to Chris's camera and journal, but the entire book is without photos (save one in the very beginning) and almost nothing from the journal (though we get to read a handful of postcard messages and letters). But upon further research, it seems that Chris's family plans to release another book that will include some photos and other material. Why they weren't included in this book puzzles me. I don't want to believe that the family is using this poor kid's tragic story as a money-making machine, but with multiple magazine articles, a book, a film, and another book on the way... one has to wonder. Chris, after all, wasn't especially close to his family.<br /><br />I would much rather have had a book filled with photos and journal entries, than Krakauer's confusing, wandering tales that jump back and forth in time (we begin the story with Chris's death? why isn't that at the end?). The timeline of the book is so jumbled that I had trouble keeping track of what was happening, where it was, when it was.<br /><br />So this book gets 3 stars from me. It was too much like a tease - giving bits of Chris's amazing story, then giving me page after page of other, unnecessary \"stuff\" before going back to Chris again. Whether he was a reckless idiot or an unfortunate philosopher, his story is touching and tragic.", "images": [], "asin": "0307387178", "parent_asin": "0307387178", "user_id": "AG7BUABJKAMZCAOSPIR5KAPRSCCQ", "timestamp": 1310486506000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The 'big reveal' was disappointing.", "text": "Liane Moriarty is a popular best-selling author and her latest book, Truly Madly Guilty, garnered a lot of hype and many good reviews. That said, the book was just okay for me.<br /><br />Set in Sydney, Australia, the story is about an unfortunate incident that occurs during a backyard barbeque. The cookout's hosts are Vid and Tiffany - a rich sociable couple that live in a luxurious home with their 10-year-old daughter Dakota. The guests include the hosts' next-door neighbors Erika and Oliver and their friends Clementine and Sam who bring their two little girls Holly (5) and Ruby (2). The story skips back and forth in time, depicting events before the barbeque, on the day of the barbeque, and after the barbeque.<br /><br />As the story unfolds we learn the backstories of some of the characters. Erika had a difficult shame-filled childhood with her mother Sylvia, a narcissistic and delusional hoarder. Feeling bad for Erika, Clementine's mother Pam took the girl under her wing and pushed Clementine to be friends with her - which Clementine resented. Erika's husband Oliver also had a dysfunctional childhood, with two alcoholic parents. Thus Erika and Oliver - both damaged - understand each other and have a quiet successful marriage.<br /><br />Clementine, by contrast, had a happy childhood.....aside from being irritated by Erika's constant presence. Clementine had loving parents, a nice home, and musical talent that was nurtured by her family. Clementine is now a professional cellist, happily married to public relations honcho Sam. Though Clementine and Sam's lives are somewhat fraught - with two small kids, two careers, and Clementine's constant fretting about auditions - the couple meanders along quite happily.<br /><br />Vid is an electrician who resembles 'Tony Soprano' and Tiffany is a successful property developer with an eye-catching sexy figure. Tiffany unashamedly admits she once worked as a pole dancer to make money for school. The couple enjoy throwing parties and Vid loves to cook - so he serves tasty dishes from recipes he finds on the internet. (I got a yen to try some of his dishes....ha ha ha.)<br /><br />On the day of the barbeque tension arises early because Erika and Oliver make a request of Clementine and Sam that throws the couple off-kilter. So it's not surprising that there's a little too much drinking and hilarity at the cookout, leading to an unfortunate occurrence. A good part of the book drops hints about the incident at the barbeque, details the emotions and actions of the characters, and relates consequences after the cookout. I have to say - after the HUGE build-up - I found the 'barbeque incident' rather predictable and mundane, and the consequences overblown and unrealistic.<br /><br />That said there are things I like about the story. It has some clever surprises and twists, and some memorable characters and scenes. For example, Sylvia the hoarder (Erika's mom) is sly, phony, funny....and VERY irritating. And social worker Pam (Clementine's mom) is overly self-righteous in her do-gooding, interfering zeal. At one point Pam gives a dinner party speech that made me (and the book's characters) quite uncomfortable. These behaviors - though squirm inducing - add interest to the story. On the other hand, 5-year-old Holly is a hoot when she sprinkles her conversation with &#34;air quotes&#34; on random words.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the book held my attention, after which I was slightly bored. And the story's final scenes didn't ring true to me. I would mildly recommend this book to fans of Liane Moriarty but it's not as good as her earlier work (IMO).", "images": [], "asin": "1250069793", "parent_asin": "1250069793", "user_id": "AHNZRQNJHNSBVKERNXSWNLKOZ6YQ", "timestamp": 1472520246000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

This is the fault of the editor that let his prose, which is rambling and repetitive, be published as is. This is especially true for the chapters on Sartre. It might have been the result of Copleston\u2019s age, for the last chapter is weak, which is unfortunate, since Merleau-Ponty is widely studied today.  Also, the short biography of Albert Camus has errors. Camus was indeed a member of the French Communist Party but was expelled as a result of his sympathy for absurdism and anarchism. He joined several anarchist movements but refused to explain philosophically or rationally the meanings of absurdism or anarchism. He chose the easy way out, writing fiction, which could not be easily criticized, and also offered him a sizable income, to be sure, winning the Noble Prize for literature three years before his death in 1960. Nonetheless, Copleston was well aware of the influence world events had on philosophers and his books are true to this history. Unfortunately, this volume of his History of Philosophy is a misnomer, since it covers only modern French philosophy, which was heavily influenced by Husserl, Heidegger, and other 20th Century German philosophers.", "images": [], "asin": "0385470460", "parent_asin": "0385470460", "user_id": "AGEUVDRKDBMB4B7VAUT5CTDKQAJQ", "timestamp": 1447593600000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

For example, during one of the orgy sequences, \"Roman\" is substituted for \"Ramon\" (when the author obviously intends a reference to Ramon Navarro and not Roman Polanski).  A more serious error involves how the actor Todd Pickett came to hook up with the surgeon who performed botched plastic surgery.  There are two divergent accounts with screwed-up time frames regarding appointments, one that seems to take place before and one after the death of a beloved pet. Obviously, Mr. Barker had done some rewriting here and had forgotten to change what came earlier.  No one else seemed to pick up on this.  The story is enjoyable, with certain similarities to \"Weaveworld,\" but the constant errors are annoying and would deserve a better rating than I have given it if someone (the author? the editor? the copy editor?) had shown enough concern to read through the galleys with a red pencil BEFORE the book was published.", "images": [], "asin": "0060182970", "parent_asin": "0060182970", "user_id": "AETING54V2SMNR3RFNXUY2VCWWQQ", "timestamp": 1034008876000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Coming of age story set in Paris", "text": "The theme for the Mocha Girls Read book of the month in January was Paris. As a group, we voted to read Black Girl in Paris by Shay Youngblood. This relatively short and extremely beautiful book was essentially a coming of age story for its protagonist, Eden, and a lovely way to kick off 2019.<br /><br />Black Girl in Paris is the story of a young lady and budding writer who picks up from her home in the United States with a little money and travels to Europe in search of the greatness that author James Baldwin wrote about. While there she encounters many people while trying to make a living and find creative inspiration in Paris.<br /><br />One thing I found it interesting about this book is that Youngblood set it in the 80s while writing it in the millennium. It could have just as easily been set in the time in which it was written. I suspect the author may have done this to demonstrate just how far way from home Eden traveled. With the technology today (and in the early part of the turn of the century), it's so much easier to be close even when there's great physical distance.<br /><br />Black Girl in Paris reads like a collection of chronological essays. Youngblood's prose is excellent and you want to follow her as a writer and Eden as the main character on this journey of self discovery. This book definitely kept me interested. This is not something I would have read but for book club. And that is one of the greater purposes of book club. I am glad I was able to partake and participate.<br /><br />My ultimate takeaway from this story is that we cannot escape racism no matter the time nor location.<br /><br />Recommendation: If you love Paris and the pursuit of one's dreams, this quick read might pique your interest.<br /><br />Until next time ...

Eve Dallas catches a death at the former NYC nightclub \u201c12\u201d, she discovers, while searching the building, yet another body \u2013 just a skeleton actually \u2013 complete with a gun laying nearby. Almost unbelievably, the gun {such weapons are now banned in our 2060 Gotham!} was the murder weapon in both deaths, probably separated by five decades or so, leading to the speculation that the skeleton belongs to a famous singer who disappeared a long time ago and now haunts \u201c12\u201d. Various mysterious apparitional appearances and sounds lead to the ghostly rumors, about which Eve and hubby Roarke have a snitty argument. Naturally, Eve works the case and will eventually solve both murders, but it takes her a good while to out the somewhat surprising perp.<br /><br />160 pages in this edition make for an entertaining hour plus of reading \u2013 and probably one\u2019s enjoyment will vary directly with the fun generated by the haunted angle.

Each person can complete dares to earn prizes and money, and the best ones advance to the grand prize round. High school Junior Vee is typically more of a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d type of person, and never dreamed of ever entering Nerve. When she\u2019s snubbed by the boy she likes, she decides she needs a change, and enters Nerve.<br /><br />The dares get progressively more \u201cintense\u201d until she\u2019s in the final round with 5 other people who all have to play together in order to win. The further she competes in the game, the more she realizes it\u2019s maybe not a game after all.<br /><br />I really expected Nerve to be more intense than it was. A lot of the dares felt really easy, but Vee reacted like they were the end of the world, and literally cried at almost every dare. It would be one thing if she was being forced to do things she didn\u2019t want to do, but she voluntarily signed up for the game!?! She also has the option to quit, but she\u2019s too obsessed with the prizes to do that. She\u2019s also obsessed with the boy who gets paired as her partner, so she doesn\u2019t want to stop working with him.<br /><br />The beginning of the book opened with a prologue that I was really intrigued by, but then the book never really answered what happened with the prologue and never touched on it again \u2013 it seemed like it was forgotten, and I found myself wishing more of the book was like the intense prologue!<br /><br />I found the way some of the characters acted to be unrealistic. Vee\u2019s parents grounded her for something that was important, but the dumbest reason to ground someone. It seemed like a really bad reaction to the event, and made me dislike Vee\u2019s parents.<br /><br />I also hated how many of Vee\u2019s actions revolved around a boy. She gets in a fight with her best friend over a boy, enters the game because of a boy, chooses not to quit the game because of a boy, and so on and so forth. I wanted to shake her and tell her to form her own identity and NOT make it wrapped up in men! You\u2019re worth more than that!<br /><br />That said, I hated the epilogue. WHY was it necessary for this book to end on a \u201ccliffhanger\u201d? It could easily have been wrapped up, and it left me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed by this one.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A bit uneven at first, but more coherent in the final section", "text": "To me, this seems to be a case where I liked the author\u2019s intentions, but didn\u2019t like how these intentions were carried out in the book. Our protagonist, Laurus, wear many hats and carries several names throughout the book, and perhaps that is a symbolic gesture to his always searching for meaning, identity and redemption.<br /><br />There is a rambling and a bit incoherent quality to much of the beginning parts to Laurus, and for that reason alone, it was sort of a slog and struggle to try to push onward. This is especially evident in the first two sections. There is a bit of structure in the opening part, where we learn the back story of the protagonist and his uncle, and how he begins his life journey, as well as the tragedy that inspires him to begin his quest. However, in the second part of the book, we are hit with episode after episodes of healing and such, and it just seemed a little too random, aimless and sporadic.<br /><br />As far as the text itself, I found some of book clunky with wording and expressions and I think it was just a translation issue or something. I also wasn\u2019t a big fan of some of the magical realism that came out of nowhere.<br /><br />Also, there are several shifts in time that seemingly come out of nowhere and are quite random. One reviewer mentioned how it felt like stories were just thrown in in any order with no relevance or coherence. I agree with that assessment, especially as we proceed into the second part of the book.<br /><br /> That being said, I think the best parts of the book are the final ones, and those made it worth the reading experience. I did enjoy several parts, such as the latter sections of Arseny\u2019s pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the spiritual and physical quest he undertakes to get there. Much of this journey is a sense of coming to terms with his guilt over a particular tragedy, and seeking redemption. So, to me, this section not only flowed with much more structure and precision, but the themes were more prevalent as well.<br /><br /> I heard many comparisons to the likes of Umberto Eco and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Middle grade fiction just misses the mark", "text": "I wanted to like this book more than I did, and I recognize that it is loved by many. I found that I was again and again put off by Ruthie's references to the \"dumb class\" throughout this novel. As an adult reader, I drew some conclusions. I assumed that ESL children were sometimes placed in remedial classes without regards to other options or additional supports. I also assumed that the author may have had a real-life experience as a child with this worry because Ruthie would not let it go. Ever. The notes at the back of the book confirmed this. I admit that I sped through the last half of the book waiting for Ruthie to articulate her frustration with misplacement of ESL children while also showing some humanity for all of the children who were assigned to the remedial class. If that happened aside from her thanks in receiving a get-well card from the class, I did not see it. This ongoing fear of being a student in this class and commentary from Ruthie made it difficult for me to care for her in the way a reader usually cares for a child protagonist of a book. I feel like this is a book that would cause more damage than good in a read-aloud. I loved the connection to Nancy Drew, Cuba, Poland, refugees, Jose Marti, Frida Kahlo and the infusion of so many cultures within her world. I liked that the central problem of healing, isolated from her usual world and activities, is not one often seen in middle grade novels. It's something that does become a reality for kids dealing with injuries and illnesses, and they should be able to see this represented in the pages of a book. By the end of the book, I found myself more interested in the untold stories of the children in the class that Ruthie scorned. I understand that this may be an unpopular opinion, and this book will do fine without my praise. If I could send Ruthie a book to read while she healed, it would be Hunt's Fish in a Tree.", "images": [], "asin": "0399546456", "parent_asin": "0399546456", "user_id": "AHIKI3WXILGVZXLBKHE36PMILRBQ", "timestamp": 1564765542221, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Marcus - too much to fit in the Subject: line!<br /><br />When I was in - approximately - third grade, _The Phantom Tollbooth_ and Madeleine L'Engle's _A Wrinkle In Time_ alternated in my mind as the Best Book In The World, depending, basically, on which one I had read more recently.<br /><br />As an adult, Martin Gardner's _Alice_ Annotations brought those books to greater life for me than they had ever had before.<br /><br />I was, therefore, expecting a fair amount from _this_ book.<br /><br />Expectations are a prison for the mind. One has to be happy with what one has to be happy with.<br /><br />In other words: I was disappointed.<br /><br />Not _completely_ disappointed, mind you. There's a lovely introduction relating the lives of Juster and Feiffer and how _TPT_ came to be - and also making me aware of a musical with lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. I'll have to check that out at some point, but right now I have this review to write.<br /><br />That introduction is the best thing Marcus has added to the book. The actual annotations are quite variable: some of them repeat information in the introduction; some of them contain information about mid-century America that might be interesting to someone younger than I, but as I recall much of it from my own life it kind of washes over me;  and a very small percentage tell me things I didn't know.<br /><br />Perhaps the dullest annotations are the ones where Marcus attempts to explain the jokes. This is a bit odd, because some of my favorite annotations in _Alice_ are explanations of jokes - but they explain jokes that I wouldn't have gotten without them, because I lack the context of a Victorian Oxonian logician. A number of Carroll's jokes have passed their best-by date, and Gardner refreshes them somewhat.<br /><br />This isn't true here. The jokes in _TPT_ are about matters a schoolchild of the current generation will understand.  As in _Alice_, there are some asides that are addressed more to grownups than to children; perhaps some precocious child would find annotations of these asides valuable, but no actual adult is likely to have any use for them.<br /><br />So I'm afraid I must judge this book fairly harshly. I enjoy rereading the _Tollbooth_ now and then, but - other than the introduction - this adds very little to the joy of the reread.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A very good start to an interesting new series", "text": "Vanessa has a fabulous way of telling a story, so fabulous it's difficult to put the book down to see to other important things, like sleeping for instance.<br /><br /> I do have one request though, that there be in the near future a female character with a stronger personality.  Many female friends I know have endured deep wounds in their past which left them with emotional and physical pain, but they don't dwell on that past on daily basis. I myself would not have developed into the strong person I am had I dwelled as often as Vanessa' s heros do on wounds inflicted in my past. Inward reflections are character building for sure, we must not forget how we got to where we are, strong and empathetic women. When I would have a need to spend time trying to understand my stories by talking about them among close friends, there be those who would sympathize, comparing their past to mine, and those who shut down because they were too entangled in their own that there just isn't room for others', they didn't want to hear about my painful memories. But there were always a couple listening and deciding on the spot, was I stuck with my past or was there something to learn from my story and who I am in the present, does my present reflect my past in positive ways. They have empathy.<br /><br />The character Yvonne, the main character in this story, and Arrow , the main character in the last series by Nelson, both feature a wanne-be-strong female characters, but both fail continuously. They never really stop  remembering and flinching from their past, there is just too much concentration put on remembering and reliving their painfully past and feeling anxiety. We don't see her deriving strength from these revisiting, she doesn't seem to benefit from such ruminations, the reactions are always the same, weakness not strength, With a MC villain or hero, either way they need to be strong, living fully in the present. Neither Arrow nor Yvonne represent examples of how I describe strong women, the kind of women, who in spite of adversity, or because of them, are real role models, the kind I want for the up-and coming next generation of young women to emulate.  Our daughters need strong examples of heros in stories they read, heros who use injustice,  adversaries, emotional and physical pain suffered, covert these type of experiences into empathy, certainly not anxiously comparing every new situation with experiences from a difficult past .  The future of this world will be resting on strong and empathetic female leaders, heros. I personally want to feel empowered by the heroines in the stories I am reading, and like most readers I have experienced eye opening AHA moment from insightful storytellers and it's one reason why I love reading.  Maybe digging a little deeper this talented writer too will find just such a heroine ready to reveal herself.<br /><br />Her stories are well told, we come to know every character, the world they live in and why they do what they do too, eventually.  This deep understanding Vanessa has of her story is very obvious. Her attention to details do not distract from the suspense and adventures,  (I wish there was a map, my memory isn't what it used to be). The unexpected keeps me reading with anticipation. In the first book of this series we are made familiar with the characters, the world they live in and to a point, what direction the events will flow, what to expect.<br /><br />It works and flows well, until about chapters 23 onwards. Here it suddenly becomes confusing because the detailed background we been given doesn't fit, suddenly don't seem true anymore,  and also suddenly got very dark. I became confused about the story. What unfolded was all wrong, the connection severed, so much didn't fit with the background information I been reading this far. I'm still confused as to what suddenly happened, but then I skipped over several pages because they just didn't sound right. I actually skipped many of the last pages. There is also some violence which seemed over the top and the whole setup unbelievable even for fiction. I was unable to imagine the descriptions of events unfolding and actions taken by the characters, numbers and scenes  contradicting themselves from one paragraph to the next - there was an unexplained number of mercenaries which seemed to come out of nowhere, the numbers of slaves, the description of the scenes impossible and not what was said earlier. This entire section just didn't make sense. It feels as if the writer was struggling to keep the story together, make sense. That is a real shame, because the story up until that point has been so well setup, the details are carefully planned and developed over time, preparing  us for a well thought out story which would be told over several books. I will read book two based on the care with which Vanessa has taken, and the promise that entails for the quality of the full story yet to unfold. I feel it would be too early and too harsh to dismiss the whole story.", "images": [], "asin": "B07SBQXYZT", "parent_asin": "B07SBQXYZT", "user_id": "AEW2YGUXD34LIG4WI4YLRNNZL6XQ", "timestamp": 1641594014508, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Informative, But Only Introduction", "text": "The observance of the seventh-day Sabbath has been a contentious issue amongst many Christians for centuries in Europe and North America, but one place that may startle many is that it has been the same in Africa.  In his book &#34;Sabbath Roots: The African Connection&#34;, Charles E. Bradford brings to light many tribal and cultural customs from across the continent giving the reader evidence of the memory and observance of the seventh-day Sabbath from all corners of Africa.<br /><br />With over 2000 years of Biblical history as well as cultural studies of hundreds of tribes across an entire continent as well as the African diaspora to the Americas, Bradford had many sources to navigate and reference to give readers a sense of how Africans fit into the continuing debate on the Sabbath.  Beginning with how God is seen from the Biblical prophets and how He is perceived in the minds of Africans on both the continent and diaspora, Bradford brings to light where each stands to the other.  Afterwards, he delves into the subject of the Sabbath on the African continent in relation to God and to cultures in and outside of Africa.  Finally Bradford turns his attention to the history of Christianity on the continent, with a main focus on colonial period which it was considered both a forced religion from the outside and a religion of protest from foreign occupation.<br /><br />In roughly 230 pages, Bradford had to cover a lot over a wide scope of scholarship and while he did a remarkable job in an engaging text and strong use of numerous sources there was only so much he could do and does leave readers with questions.  The biggest and most important issue deals with the Sabbath itself.  Outside the well-known Black Jewish groups, the Falasha and the Lemba, and writing briefly about the Jewish diaspora in Africa, Bradford does indicate if the cultural and tribal traditions of the seventh-day Sabbath across the continent are all from Jewish contact or a mixture of Noahide memory and contact with Jewish influences.  This lingering question while not invalidating Bradford\u2019s thesis, does leave it up to interpretation.<br /><br />Although the question of when Sabbath entered into the cultural traditions of tribes all over Africa is unanswered, &#34;Sabbath Roots&#34; is still a very welcome addition to information about the seven-day Sabbath.  But Bradford\u2019s book should only be considered an introduction, especially in relation to Africa, and should inspire readers to look for more information after reading.", "images": [], "asin": "1578470560", "parent_asin": "1578470560", "user_id": "AFLGBVEMLLK253RZFCAKA224C4GA", "timestamp": 1494723060000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Pre-Storyville", "text": "New Orleans certainly boasts a colorful history, what with Andrew Jackson and pirate Jean Lafitte teaming to defeat the British at the close of the War of 1812 (actually after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed, so technically after the war had ended), the city constantly battling the encroachment of Gulf waters, and, the subject of this book, the confinement of prostitution and bordellos to a red-light district. While many cities have had formal red-light districts (and some still do, like Amsterdam and many German cities), New Orleans\u2019 version has always held a sort of romantic appeal, perhaps because of its nickname, \u201cStoryville,\u201d or that it is way back in history.<br /><br />Lynn and Martin attempt to resurrect the period, really 1898, the time leading up to the inauguration of the district, by novelizing the life of a young prostitute. While interesting and definitely portraying the misery that was (and is) street prostitution, it\u2019s never as compelling as you might expect a novel on this topic to be. Truth be told, it\u2019s kind of flat. Lynn and Martin might have done better by shortening the build-up to the instituting of the district and lengthening the portion devoted to the district.<br /><br />In fact, there was a real Mary Deubler, the central character. She, however, wasn\u2019t nearly as downtrodden and hapless as her novelized version. She proved a quite shrewd entrepreneurial type who did operate a house called the Arlington, who even in short biographical sketches sounds intriguing. Probably many of the characters who have basis in history, like Tom Anderson and Lulu White, were more interesting than as Lynn and Martin portray them.

Surely this mystery must have extra turns; surely this thriller trenchantly examines a current problematic social trend; surely the protagonist must be more humanly flawed than most and must be compelling and nuanced! What I read instead was a perfectly fine, perfectly mystery/psychological thriller. Sure, the bending of reality via flawed perception is in the zeitgeist; this is another treatment on the topic. Certainly mental health is an ever more prevalent concern; this book mentions some counseling and medication. At the end of the day willpower overcomes mental illness and I don\u2019t know that this is the most positive message to convey. Willpower is certainly a part, but so are vulnerability and professional help and exercise and meditation and eating and community and a thousand (rough estimate) other factors.

These are, admittedly, somewhat long on wartime kinds of stories, of dangerous assignments on the frontlines of Afghanistan and elsewhere. There is a lot of politics too, but that is to be expected from the kind of reporting Scott Pelley has been known for, and here he can be open about where his sympathies and leanings lie.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty impressive memoir. Still, it didn\u2019t end up being a very stirring story. The jumbling of stories doesn\u2019t work as well in a book as in one-hour weekly TV segments, especially when the time line is also mixed up. Many of the stories are just a little too long, a little too detailed, to hold the reader\u2019s interest to the end of the chapter. And, unless you are really into military stories, there are too many segments dealing with this topic.<br /><br />Perhaps with a little more editorial pruning, perhaps at least 100 pages cut from the 400+ current length, this might have sustained my interest more.

In spite of its funniness, it is also chaplinesque sad. Jonasson manages to write both funny and ironic - and sad.

Assuming that the main political characters are described trustworthy, which there is no reason to believe that they are, and that the main  characters of the story are just caricatures, which there is every reason to believe they are, this book  will give good insight into some version of South African policy 1960- 1984.<br /><br />The third book is about a pair of Swedish twins that were physical identical, but mentally contrasting. The title could be:\" The twins and their King\" The story is too bizarre to understand, the twins too close to caricatures that you feel anything for them and you don't see how they could exist, even within this bizarre universe \" Holger 1 saw, felt and understood. Holger 2 did not see, did not understood. But he felt.\"  (p. 132.)

I guess so, within the same reality as Jonasson has on South African policy.<br /><br />However, maybe the book still has to be three in one? I liked the two first part and swallowed the last part.

But, as the book moved on we read as &#34;Z&#34; started to hook back into the dating game and we read of all his up's and downs in the dating world. What was interesting as a reader is that this book is all told through the male perspective and we get a glimpse into the relationship basics of what it's like through the guy's eyes. I do admit being a female and reading this book in parts was quite difficult as the humor was definitely guy's humor and I was like hmmm, ok that's just cringeworthy and not worth talking about e.g jerking off etc. But overall, it was an eye-opener reading this book and glancing from the male's point of view and also written by a male as in the world of romance fiction, it is very rare to have a book with this content written by a male author.<br /> So readers, if you are wanting the &#34;LAD&#34; point of view on relationships and wanting to catch a glimpse of what goes on in your guy's head , then check out Greater Expectations by Alexander McCabe and you will not be disappointed.", "images": [], "asin": "B00MGAQTE8", "parent_asin": "B00MGAQTE8", "user_id": "AHKVAYJF4Q6KU5WOCXNBBUYG34MA", "timestamp": 1424222835000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

A call soon after, with a possible identification, leads Clay on a long pursuit to find the truth.<br /><br />Having read the other books in this series, I was disappointed in the lack of progression of the character of Clay Edison.

Although I disagreed with the late Dr. Kofsky about the fundamental potential of the species H. sapiens (and thus remained a political opposite, far, far to his right), as his student I continue to marvel at his research a decade after his untimely death. I must concede that it has sadly gone to waste a bit in the text of this book--though good, it's not at all special in the company of its peers. I must also agree that its tendency toward Marxist religious banter (which must inherently replace logical conclusions in Marxist writing) reduces its academic value per se; none the less I still find it beautiful in its architecture. I can only hope that the breadth of his life's work fell intact into the hands of his graduate assistant, who took over instruction in his last days as a professor in Sacramento. Whether it has or not, this book is well worth considering, especially to a student designing his or her own research. Its annotations and bibliography promise an excruciatingly well investigated line of departure for any intended work on the period, right, left, or simply rational.

Now with a stronger sense of self confidence and with the adult X-Men away at the reading of Xavier's last will and testament (see [[ASIN:0785154892 Uncanny X-Men Volume 4: Vs.

The X-Men are shunted from our universe (known as Earth 616) to Earth 1610-- a parallel Earth in the multiverse that is home of Miles Morales, Ultimate Spider-Man.  Scattered throughout this alternate Earth, the X-Men are put to the test! Iceman finds himself fighting mole people in a very steamy Atlanta.  Beast becomes the prisoner of Dr. Doom. Angel ends up in the Savage Land. And X-23 learns the origin of mutants in this alternate dimension! Jean Grey and Ultimate Spider-Man team up with this world's X-Men to set things right.<br /><br />Writer Brian Michael Bendis seems a bit overly fond of time/space displacement, even if in this particular instance it was nice to see the time-displaced X-Men team up with Ultimate Spider-Man. That said, having the young X-Men meet older X-Men and then revealing that adult life didn't work out how the teens thought it might seems a little tired at this point.

It brings to question destiny and if you can change the outcome or if its all self-fulfilling prophecies.

This is not my favorite set. They could have put more than 2 sight words in each book, and made it less about phonics. To read these you have to know long vowels (the rules of silent e and double vowels), the rule that \"ew\" and \"oo\" can make a U sound, and other rules for sounding out words. But a student will probably be assigned all 50 sight words in the set before they get to all these other rules.<br /><br />Also, some words in these books are just too big for the young beginning reader. Pepperoni and Butterflies, really? They have a picture of a pizza, or a picture of butterflies, to give the student clues what these big words are supposed to be. I prefer a book to have words that are on the right reading level for the child, to reinforce words they already know, and introduce a few new ones in each book.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Fourth Book in the Kendra Michaels Series", "text": "I was given the opportunity to read an electronic copy of Night Watch via NetGalley and St. Martin's Press.  This is my honest opinion of the book.<br /><br />Kendra Michaels has just delivered a research paper at a conference on aging at Pepperdine University, regarding music therapy for Alzheimer patients when she sees Dr. Charles Waldridge.  Responsible for the Night Watch project that helped to restore Kendra's sight nine years before, Waldridge goes missing just after meeting with Kendra.  Enlisting the help of her friend Adam Lynch, along with Special Agent Michael Griffin of the FBI, Kendra starts her own investigation into the disappearance.  Using the special skills that she has honed after years of living in the dark, Kendra soon discovers that there is a deeper mystery to Waldridge's disappearance.  With danger swirling all around her, will Kendra be able to uncover the secrets and find the doctor before it is too late?<br /><br />As the fourth book in the Kendra Michaels series, I was surprised to find out so many details about this character.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Sub-par space opera", "text": "Evan Currie's \"Into the Black: Odyssey One,\" a re-edit and re-package of Odyssey One (2011), according to Cleigh Currie (see discussion here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/forum/cd/discussion.html?ie=UTF8&cdForum=Fx376GGZL25AFA0&cdThread=Tx25E3DQ888YYJP), is not exactly David Weber, but then not much in the sci fi universe is for those of us who enjoy the best of military sci fi. Most definitely the description of the book as \"a first-rate military science fiction epic that combines space opera and modern storytelling\" is stretching things just a bit, and I'm being generous.<br /><br />The story begins in the years after World War III, which took place as one might expect between and eastern and a western bloc. The protagonist, Captain Eric Weston is a fighter pilot who because of his heroics in the war has been promoted to captain the NAC (North American Confederation or simply `the Confed' and comprised of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico) ship Odyssey for a voyage of exploration into deep space (I should mention this is not exactly Star Trek either).<br /><br />The explanation that Weston's  \"rather public position as the flight leader of the Archangels had put him on the short list to captain her\" doesn't really explain why a fighter pilot is the best guy to captain a huge new prototype ship with an experimental drive on a voyage of intergalactic exploration. One would expect him to take command of a smaller ship first, or perhaps a staff position or perhaps command of all fighter defenses in the NAC. Certainly there must be officers who outrank him or have seniority. The reasoning seems to be that he is the hero, ergo he gets the ship, which isn't exactly how the military works.<br /><br />In any event, Weston arrives on aboard his new command and takes it into space. One doesn't find the crisp military protocol of the Honorverse here either; it is reminiscent of Star Trek where a more comradely and less formal atmosphere prevails. We are not given any description of the Odyssey when Weston arrives to take command, as one might expect, viewing the mighty new ship from the exterior on his approach, or even when he enters, which would seem another good opportunity. As the ship leaves the vicinity of earth and heads toward Mars we know almost nothing about it beyond a brief description of its drive and that it is now home to Weston's old unit, the Archangels. We know precisely nothing about its actual mission. Star Trek, at least, gave us that information at the opening credits.<br /><br />These deficits make getting into the novel difficult. By now I was only on page 22 and over 500 pages to go.  I found myself hoping that things would pick up once they left our solar system but I was quickly disappointed. Apparently the Transition drive works something like a Star Trek transporter, at least in appearance and the crew watches their ship disintegrate, and then reconstruct itself at its destination. The Transition drive description again loses in comparison to David Weber's description of hyperspace travel. Science aside, I could feel the sense of wonder and beauty, reading Weber.<br /><br />Arriving at Alpha Centauri they pick up some sort of distress call, identified as such by the \"linguistic telepath\" (I'm sorry, I started thinking Counselor Deanna Troi here) through means probably best not explained. It will take the Odyssey hours to clear Alpha Centauri's gravity well but rather than scout it, map it, scan it or even bother to look at it with anything approaching the wonder you'd expect, they sail right off on a 28-light-year journey to the distress signal. At this point I had pretty much lost interest in the entire enterprise (pardon the pun).<br /><br />Things just seem sort of random, lacking any real internal consistency. For example, upon learning of the distress call Captain Weston asks his XO, \"I don't suppose anybody we know is out there?\" How could there by anybody they know out there, 28-light-years away, if as seems the case, they are the first such ship to leave earth? Do you really want to sound that stupid in front of your subordinates?<br /><br />By page 56 I knew I had had enough. Arriving on the scene, the Captain decides he IS Captain Kirk and that his primary responsibility is not his own ship and crew, or even the mission (whatever that is) and that he can go running off in a shuttle to perform a rescue operation and let others worry about his responsibility. And what does he find? A pretty black-haired girl. I mean, look...nothing against Star Trek here. I enjoyed Star Trek. But this isn't supposed to be Star Trek - it's supposed to be a \"first-rate military science fiction epic.\" Sadly, old-school space opera seems to be the primary element of this tale and not particularly well-written old school space opera. This whole thing was completely predictable. You knew if there was no pretty officer on the Odyssey that the first thing Captain Weston would do was find one.<br /><br />No, Honor Harrington this is not. And it's not as though the writing is any great shakes either, as I said above. It's very light on descriptions and motivations. We don't know much about Captain Weston by page 56 and even less about his XO or any other crew members. We know next to nothing about the Odyssey itself and its capabilities (it took on fuel before leaving earth, but what kind of fuel? Reactor mass? What?), and still nothing about their mission, which seems to be along the lines of gallivanting around on the whim of the captain. The dialogue is not terrible but it's not great either and to be honest, the crew does not sound (or act) particularly military to me. Weston's XO is more his \"friend\" than his XO and I'm sorry, I wouldn't want to see my captain \"slump\" on the bridge in front of the crew. What kind of signal does that send? My seven-year-old would do that but I don't want my captain doing that.<br /><br />I honestly can't find a single good thing to say about this book except the premise - space exploration. It should be full of wonder but there is no wonder described in this book, either from the author's third person perspective or in the thoughts of the humans who are experiencing it. Captain Weston's last thought on page 60 is \"Command sucks\" - unfortunately, so does this book.", "images": [], "asin": "1612182348", "parent_asin": "1612182348", "user_id": "AFU7FI6YBMQHWY3AK2RURTUSAQKQ", "timestamp": 1332524375000, "helpful_vote": 38, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "At Least the Food Sounded Good", "text": "Caution for some very, very vague spoilers and a larger spoiler that\u2019s marked. The very last paragraph sums up my feelings without these.<br /><br />What can I say about this book other than I am mystified that people consider this good writing. There is good writing trying to escape here, crawling around through the words shouting \u2018please don\u2019t go\u2019 and perhaps with the level of editorial craftsmanship that Harper Lee had gotten this book would be excellent. The premise certainly was good but to me personally the execution was considerably lacking.<br /><br />The general gist of the story is of Mattie, a 78 year old woman who is spritely and who we mostly follow throughout, and her adventures with finding a dog and then a juvenile delinquent on her doorstep. Sometimes the point of view switches to other characters and that\u2019s one of the problems.  On page three we met her son Robert and on page four we get a random thought process of him worried she\u2019s alone and perhaps she should have a pet.<br /><br />Does this happen often and consistently? No.<br /><br />Instead this happens randomly throughout that we get into some character\u2019s head at any moment and it simply seems to be a mechanism to tell us something that the author doesn\u2019t know how else to put out there.<br /><br />Then there is the telling. Oh bless the light do we get hit over the head with some things. Mattie on tells us in various parts all about what her children are, what they do, why she has issues with them. It\u2019s an entire change in narration style to infodump on us. And it happens quite often that we get sudden spurts of information just pushed out there and left as though it is the only way to tell us these facts.<br /><br />Strangely enough we also don\u2019t get other critical information. While she tells us facts about her children we never get a sense of why they ae the way they are. All the details are the ones that float on the surface and anything that could be troublesome, those pesky reasons for character motivations or even real development that are tangled up and deeper down are never really addressed for anyone.<br /><br />The thing is though, and this goes back to my comment on the good writing trying to get out, the author does have chances to tell us this information in a more natural way that fits more with the punchy short style he seems to prefer. Examples:<br /><br />- Mattie has thoughts  about buttons at one point which is poignant and gets across her feelings about certain things regarding her children far more naturally then her just randomly thinking Very Important Details of them while making lunch.<br /><br />- After point blank telling us about how she doesn\u2019t like a character Mattie drifts during a prayer thinking about said woman in a way that would have gotten that idea across and made me want to throw the book across the room because it was so much better.<br /><br />- A gossiping character provides background information while on the phone and it feels exactly what this character would do. I wish there was more of this instead of the random dumps of character details we get.<br /><br />[Spoiler]<br /><br />This brings us to the ending which I will not talk about in any detail but re-reading the last few pages makes me wonder if Mattie is doing what she\u2019s doing because it\u2019s right or if it\u2019s because she wants to fulfill her own needs which some may see as shellfish. I\u2019m going with the latter, that she didn\u2019t grow the way she should have to be able to get to the point where she\u2019s doing what the book has talked about for over a hundred a pages of its length \u2013 to treat even the worst among us as well as if they were Jesus.<br /><br />Not to mention what she\u2019s going to do when her so called friends at her church turn around and bite her and she finds out after her supposed breakthrough. Especially after her daydreams about the warmth and healing nature of church and how that's going to tear her world apart. Or the reaction of her children since they already see her as lacking at her age and could take rather drastic steps to stop her. It\u2019s a cliffhanger ending leaving us without a clear resolution of the cascade of events Mattie has started.<br /><br />I suppose it\u2019s just me but if you want to bring in events that could ruin a character\u2019s life don\u2019t add them to the end of a rather fluffy novel about a Southern lady who disarms all arguments with cooking.<br /><br />[End Spoiler]<br /><br />One reviewer I read wondered if the author actually liked his main character and after re-reading certain parts I want to agree with them and say no. In fact most characters were portrayed negatively especially the church women. While I won\u2019t deny that I haven\u2019t met women like this growing up in the church (I definitely have) or seen the behavior exhibited by them at the same time there was like no one good. No one that followed what was preached. I\u2019d go so far to say as the only one the author actually sympathized with is Wesley since he actually got a much clearer redemption arc while almost everyone else merrily paved their path to hell.<br /><br />Please remember that the above is my own personal opinion and that those who read this may find it the cats meow. To me it was a disappointment especially considering the plot of an older woman who is still independent. I grew up with grandmothers and great-grandmothers and even great-aunts who were like Mattie in terms of her activity level and they were like that into their nineties (minus the lawn mowing of course at that age!). I like seeing older protagonists in literature, especially women, and was disappointed greatly that Mattie herself seemed like an idealized version that wanted to change but in the end made me question if she had at all.", "images": [], "asin": "0345346491", "parent_asin": "0345346491", "user_id": "AG4N7LVZNPFIIID4VM4MGTTYPN6A", "timestamp": 1471942462000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Introduction to the Calculus - Herstein, Sandler", "text": "My earlier aquaintence with I.N. Herstein is through his Topics in Algebra (1964, 2nd edition 1975) which was my first encounter with abstract algebra. In 1971, Herstein's Introduction to Calculus was published, written with Reuben Sandler. There were no further editions. This is not a typical calculus textbook and I wonder how popular it was in its day. The book is cramped and plodding, verbose and tedious. Their intentions, however, were admirable enough.<br /><br />\"There has been a tendency in the last 10-15 years to do the calculus for the beginner in a completely formal, rigorous, and - to our minds - stilted way. This preoccupation with detail and technique of proof, rather than with the basic ideas involved, have made a dark mystery out of concepts which are essentially clear and simple. The student, unaware of the basic direction of the subject, confuses the detail of rigorizing an argument with the fundamental ideas being developed. In consequence, the average student, upon finishing his first year of calculus, has neither a full and coherent picture of what the subject is about, nor a mature understanding of mathematical technique and rigor. His ability to use the reasoning and results of the calculus - and let's never forget that the calculus was devised to handle large classes of problems in and out of mathematics - unfortunately is too limited by this formalistic approach.<br /><br />\"Our motivation for writing this book is a desire to fight this recent trend. In this we are certainly not the first - in recent years a fine attempt in this direction was made by Serge Lang. It should be pointed out that the calculus was taught unrigorously for the largest part of this century; unrigorously, but, unfortunately, too often sloppily. One can give an intuitive approach to the subject which is honest and correct without being sloppy, if one limits one's attention to well-behaved functions. Fortunately, such well-behaved functions exist in abundance and are, in fact, the functions that arise in the basic material of mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, and many other fields.<br /><br />\"We have tried to be completely intuitive and to motivate the various ideas and concepts introduced. But there are times when one must get down to the fine points of an argument in order to give an honest presentation.... All in all, we have tried to keep a uniformly intuitive approach, paying as little heed to formalism and rigor as possible without distorting matters.\"<br /><br />That \"fine attempt\" by Serge Lang has faired far better than the effort of Herstein and Sandler. Lang's calculus books (his \"First Course\" was already in a 2nd edition by 1971) are enduring classics and still in print. Others from that period, and still going strong, include texts by Salas and Hille, George Thomas, Thomas Apostol, and Michael Spivak.<br /><br />This book by Herstein and Sandler is probably nobody's idea of a classic. They essentially talk you through single-variable calculus. Their approach is to pretend to discover the methods of calculus through \"intuition\" and futzing about. The book is laid out in block paragraphs cluttered with mathematical notation without any offsetting emphasis of formulas, theorems, or especially significant information. With extremely few exceptions, every bit of mathematics in this book is written within the linear confines of a prose sentence embedded within a multi-sentence paragraph. The page layout in this book is annoying.<br /><br />Here's what the blurb on the dust jacket says: \"This text presents a short, intuitive treatment of the one-variable calculus. The approach, although careful and honest, does not emphasize rigor, but instead makes great use of heuristic arguments. In preference to the theorem-proof format, plausibility arguments that easily convert into formal proofs are described in a smooth, free-flowing narrative style. Analytic geometry is presented through examples rather than formal presentations. Key points are summarized at the end of each section. In the last chapter, the notion of limits is rigorously defined and used to give proofs of the more important theorems found earlier in the book and to indicate a general way of rendering rigorous the subject matter of calculus.\"<br /><br />I came upon a second-hand copy of this in a local bookstore and bought it, despite the cluttered blocks of text I saw on the pages, because of a good price and Herstein's name on the cover.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Doesn't exactly soar", "text": "Having just enjoyed \"Hawk Quest\", by Robert Lyndon, I allowed myself to be lured into ordering another falconry-centric historical fiction Vine selection. Unfortunately, this is one book I'll have to cut loose and whistle down the wind.<br /><br />Unlike Lyndon, author Katia Fox knows little or nothing about falconry. My husband is a fireman, and he refuses to watch firefighting-themed movies because they're so annoyingly unrealistic. That's how I felt when I started reading this book. The main character, William, rescues a falcon that has been injured while trying to subdue its prey. William is a young kid who gathers up the falcon in his cloak, sneaks it home and hides it in an outbuilding, where he treats the bird's injuries. All with no training, no equipment, no knowledge of animal husbandry (or maybe this was established in the first part of this series, which I haven't read). We are introduced to a falcon as tame and harmless as a golden retriever puppy.<br /><br />The characters are flat and predictable. The dialogue is stilted. The author would have greatly benefited from an editor willing to ruthlessly cut away some of the overblown language and pare this book down by at least 200 pages.<br /><br />I like accurate historical fiction, and I think this particular series could have been a great introduction to 12th Century England, especially for a young person who thinks history is boring and overrated. Too bad the book didn't rise to my expectations. Maybe someone who knows less about falconry would enjoy the story more than I did.", "images": [], "asin": "1611090369", "parent_asin": "1611090369", "user_id": "AEZIHPOKDE77G27VSJL3WA4EYPKQ", "timestamp": 1375047602000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 1.0, "title": "This book is ultimately not very instructive about just war - Fourth Edition: Terrible wine in a new bottle", "text": "At a lecture at West Point United States Military Academy April 6, 2006, Naom Chomsky argued, &#34;Just war theory&#34; literature &#34;deserves special attention but is ultimately not very instructive about just war&#34;. &#34;Just war theory&#34; is &#34;declarations of personal preference&#34;, which &#34;never tells you anything. It doesn't tell you when it is proper to intervene, what it tells you is 'I think it is proper to intervene'...there is a big gap between assertion and argument, between surmise and evidence.&#34; &#34;We learn very little about just war from 'Just war theory'&#34; what we do learn is &#34;mostly about the prevailing moral and intellectual climate in which we live.&#34; Walzer's book relies crucially on such premises as &#34;Seems to me entirely justified, or I believe, or no doubt.&#34; Chomsky then discusses scientific studies on human behavior which is noticeably absent from Walzer's book.<br /><br />Walzer uses the term &#34;I think&#34; at least 52 times in the book. &#34;I don't think&#34; 7 times. &#34;I believe&#34; twice, &#34;no doubt&#34; at least 41 times, and &#34;seems to me&#34; 12 times (I write &#34;at least&#34; because the same phrase twice on one page would be counted once.)<br /><br />Walzer's hypocricy<br /><br />In a book which suffers from terribly bad organization, on page 62 Walzer finally systematically lays out his arguments, stating that &#34;Once the agressor state has been militarily repulsed, it can also be punished.&#34;<br /><br />On December 29, 2005, in an interview on NPR Morning Edition ('Just and Unjust Wars' Author Critical on Iraq.) Walzer stated that the Iraq war was not a just war:<br /><br />&#34;If you are going to use military force in someone else's county...There has to be a cause of some urgency, a massacre in progress. A massacre in memory is not a just cause.&#34;<br /><br />Therefore, if you follow Walzer's assertions to its obvious conclusion, the Iraq war was not a just war and therefore &#34;the agressor state&#34;, the US, should &#34;be punished.&#34;<br /><br />But Walzer signed and endorsed The Euston Manifesto, which states in part:<br /><br />&#34;We are also united in the view that, since the day on which this occurred, the proper concern of genuine liberals and members of the Left should have been the battle to put in place in Iraq a democratic political order and to rebuild the country's infrastructure...rather than picking through the rubble of the arguments over intervention.&#34;<br /><br />Therefore in Just and unjust wars, Walzer argues that &#34;agressor states&#34; should be &#34;punished&#34; but yet Walzer signs a document which criticize those who &#34;pick through the rubble of the arguments over intervention.&#34;<br /><br />Although the Iraq War is not covered in this book, Walzer's inconsistent views on the Iraq war should give serious students of International affairs pause before subscribing to his arguments. It is one mans opinion, full of statments such as &#34;Seems to me entirely justified&#34; &#34;I believe&#34; or &#34;no doubt.&#34;<br /><br />Walzer's arguments are unscientific rablings of one intellectual which are &#34;ultimately not very instructive about just war&#34;.", "images": [], "asin": "0465037070", "parent_asin": "0465037070", "user_id": "AGEVNWIXLQ3OU3MKYE6QIBE4XT3A", "timestamp": 1410095105000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A bit disappointing when compared to The Chosen One", "text": "I had extremely high hopes for Miles From Ordinary considering that I loved The Chosen One.  That book was deep, shocking, and heartwrenching.  I remember sobbing for a half hour after I finished The Chosen One about three hours after I started it.  I expected the same thing from Miles From Ordinary and ultimately, I ended up a tad bit disappointed.<br /><br />I'm going to start out by saying that Miles From Ordinary starts out sloooowwww, like really, really, really slow.  It took me about three days to get through the first 50 pages.  It just didn't hook me at first and I kept wanting to put it down.  It was like pulling teeth for me.  Sure, it was mildly interesting, but I guess there was a disconnect between me and the protagonist that prevented me from making any true headway until after the initial 60 or so pages.<br /><br />That's another issue I had with Miles from Ordinary.  The voice of the protagonist was a bit...off.  She seemed a bit on the juvenile side even for thirteen.  I kept forgetting she was thirteen and thinking she was about ten or eleven.  I understand that dealing with her mentally ill mother must have stunted her growth a bit, but I just expect a thirteen year old to be a little bit more...aware than Lacey was.  Oh, and I totally didn't buy (mild spoiler here) the whole thing with Linda not being able to help Lacey because the mom kept kicking her out.  If Linda had made a big deal about not wanting Lacey to be with her mom because of her initial depression, chances are Child Protective Services would've gotten involved.  Maybe they wouldn't have initially snatched the child, but it would've been enough of an issue to have them, at the very least, make an unannounced visit to check out that everything was fine.  That, of course, would've proved that everything wasn't fine and Linda would've had a good chance to keep Lacey. (end of mild spoiler)<br /><br />Besides my issues with the book, I do have to say that the last 40 pages or so of Miles From Ordinary were filled with tension.  In fact, the last chapters were absolutely terrifying.  I really felt for Lacey there and have no idea how she managed to keep semi-calm because there's no way in hell I would've been calm.  I would have been freaking out immensely.  So, all in all, I thought that Miles From Ordinary was just okay.  It didn't compare at all to The Chosen One and was a bit uneven.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I'm totally on the fence about this one.", "text": "So it has taken me a bit to gather my thoughts enough to review Grey by E.L. James, which if you didn\u2019t know is Fifty Shades Of Grey told from the male leads POV, Christian Grey.<br />I was really interested in this retelling of the original story to see if there was much of a difference from the story we all know and if it\u2019s been altered a bit since the recent movie. I was also interested in seeing how the authors writing style may have matured since the original as well. Lastly, I wanted to see if there were more details into Christian\u2019s childhood or backstory that we didn\u2019t get in the first telling. So here\u2019s my review and a bit of a synopsis.<br />Christian Grey is a man obsessed. A man who is in control of his world. That is until Anna Steel crashes into his office and into his life. She is an innocent and definitely not in control of anything. The two will embark on a journey of discovery; in and out of the bedroom and only their willingness to be together and bend their own rules can love prevail.<br />This book is a cliffy, so be warned. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you haven\u2019t read the original Fifty but let me say this, if you haven\u2019t read Fifty, you could pick this one up as a standalone, seriously! Even though it\u2019s a cliffy, it does wrap up nicely. A newbie could walk away with having sampled a taste and know that the two will ultimately be together.<br />Anywho with that being said, I did like hearing the story from his POV. I personally prefer male POV\u2019s much more then female. I like the darkness of them verses the usual light and fluffy female telling. I also liked hearing him cuss and call her sweetheart and baby in his head, it was a much more endearing telling of the same story verses her take. You walk away from the story understanding his stalker-ish tendencies a bit more and how she becomes a lifeline for him, only to completely screw the pooch and cut the line by hurting her and how it takes him finally bending his ways and deciding rather then fit her into his life, he needs to fit into hers. He tries so hard in the first book to make her into what he needs that he ultimately loses her until he realizes through therapy that rather then make her into what he needs, he should try the opposite and try to be what she needs, which I don\u2019t think came across in the movie or in the first book. So I did love seeing that POV of the story.<br />What I didn\u2019t like was that we didn\u2019t really get much more of his past. We got some scene snippets and we do feel the heartbreak of an abused child but I really didn\u2019t feel like it added to the story as much as I had hoped. Granted, I don\u2019t want to relive his childhood through the book but I didn\u2019t feel that much more was gained through the scenes that I didn\u2019t know about from the first telling. Also, I felt it was basically the EXACT same story but with a male slant, if that makes sense?

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Fascinating wilderness world, but ultimately this story frustrated me", "text": "This might be the first time where I picked up a book that a few of my SF&F blogger friends enjoyed... and didn't like it as much as they did. Which is a bummer, because Sarah Beth Durst does a few things quite well in THE QUEEN OF BLOOD. I just wish its weaknesses hadn't frustrated me so much.<br /><br />THE QUEEN OF BLOOD is the first book in a YA/adult crossover epic fantasy series that features malevolent nature spirits, human youths (mostly girls, but also the occasional boy) who can control these spirits, and queens who are skilled in this practice and chosen by the spirits to keep the tenuous peace between nature and humanity. Daleina is one such candidate for this honor. At age 10, her village is destroyed in a spirit attack, and her powers manifest for the first time as she saves her family. The horrors she endured spur her to join one of Aratay's academies later on so she can protect her people. But as Daleina grows older and learns to harness her powers, spirit attacks like the one her village suffered continue to plague Aratay. Who's behind these attacks? Is Queen Fara losing her sway over the nature spirits? Most frightening of all, what if the attacks aren't accidents at all?<br /><br />For me, the two dominant strengths of THE QUEEN OF BLOOD are worldbuilding and plot. The best word to describe the forest realm of Aratay is &#34;wilderness.&#34; It's inhabited yet untamed, dangerous and beautiful. Its people are closely tied to the land and the spirits they co-exist with. Entire villages and cities are constructed in gigantic trees. The lore of the nature spirits and the overall way of the world is demonstrated quite well without info-dumping, so it's easy to become immersed in Aratay's happenings.<br /><br />As for the plot, it seems fairly straightforward until the second half - and then HOLY PLOT TWISTS. This story serves turn after turn as it closes in on the end, and the suspense mounts to the point where you absolutely NEED to know how it ends. I did predict one of the plot twists correctly (it's easy to guess who's behind the spirit attacks), but the others... Wow. I did not see them coming, and they make for a fitting yet unexpectedly brutal ending.<br /><br />The characters of THE QUEEN OF BLOOD, though... I did like Daleina a lot. She's far from any &#34;chosen one&#34; or &#34;special snowflake&#34; trope. Rather, she's one of the weaker students in her academy magic-wise, but she compensates for it with courage, determination, and an enviable work ethic. Her motivations are noble, too; she's more concerned about her family and the welfare of Aratay's people than power or prestige. But the other characters... Apart from Ven, I don't feel like I got to know them very well. The other academy students seemed too similar and blended into one another by the end, and Queen Fara was a stereotypical corrupted queen-seductress-madwoman.<br /><br />I also wasn't that impressed by the writing in THE QUEEN OF BLOOD. Durst certainly knows how to build a believable world and plot an exciting story. But for a fantasy novel that's meant to appeal to both YA and adult audiences, the writing lacked a distinct voice and sense of maturity. And for me, the quality of an author's writing can either enhance the story and fold me further into its spell, or disengage me from the experience. I think you can guess where this book fell on that spectrum.<br /><br />Ultimately, THE QUEEN OF BLOOD frustrated me as much as it fascinated me. And that's a shame, considering the stunning and unique worldbuilding. Maybe if the sequel improves on this first book, I'll continue the series.<br /><br />Maybe...", "images": [], "asin": "006247409X", "parent_asin": "006247409X", "user_id": "AGXOFDKGAESNV62XRQ2ISG76YGCQ", "timestamp": 1496173314000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Preaching to the Choir", "text": "I tried to be open and listen to this. I reached a point, I just couldn't go any further.  Maybe it was the style.  Maybe it was the vitriolic writing rather than impartiality?  Or perhaps it was the opinions stated as fact?  Maybe it is the glorification of the past without regard for what it has caused in the future?  For example:  While it is true that social security initially started as a social redistribution program paid for by the rich, it isn't a glorious program when it became compulsory to be paid for by everyone.  Dare I mention that it has now grown to be one of the largest unfunded mandates in the U.S.?  And Medicare?  Has it really pulled the common people out of poverty?  Between Social Security and Medicare they are the top two problems with the national debt.  So while they might have been good ideas at the time, over time they act as the biggest debt chains on everyone in the U.S.<br /><br />Or another example - the term 'Economic Equality' when used by a liberal.  Economic equality to a liberal means that those who work or have money support the lazy ones .  Why don't they just say socialism or communism and bring up Russia or China? Russia collapsed and China found that people wouldn't work if they couldn't be rewarded for their efforts.<br /><br />So while it may be true that conservatives Bush and Reagan did bad things, it is also true that the liberals have done some abominable things to take away the rights and economies of the common person.<br /><br />So while this may be a study in viewpoints that perhaps shows a different perspective to conservativism, this book isn't what I had hoped it would be.

However, I enjoyed her description of family and school life, although it was problematic at best.  She writes fairly well, but I wouldn't call it \"literature\".<br /><br />What totally surprised me is that she is a product of the 60's but only by dint of birth.  Her life was so controlled, I found it stifling.  She remembers her parents as close and nurturing but I don't see how being raised by a nanny on a separate floor of the house is truly \"close and nurturing\".  They were totally involved with themselves, first and foremost.  She went back and forth to Hollywood making movies for Disney but was almost a cipher in her personal life.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Fictionalized early New England history lesson", "text": "Mother-less Bethia is allowed to wander Great Harbor to her heart's content in this novel set in the mid-1600's on the pretext of gathering wild foods. Along the way she meets a Wampanoag youth she names Caleb and they traverse the dunes, forests, streams and shore of present-day Martha's Vineyard together. Along with teaching her how to forage better, they teach each other their native languages and Bethia introduces him to her version of Christianity.<br /><br />Due to circumstances beyond her control, Bethia ends up an indentured servant when her father dies, following her brother and Caleb to Boston and Harvard, to help finance her brother's scholarship. While she has surreptitiously absorbed her father's drilling in Latin, the Bible and the letters while at the family hearth faster than her brother, she is expected to hide her learning and toil to advance her brother's status. Meanwhile she gets to keep an eye on her friend Caleb and act as a mother to the younger students being tutored at the house she is indentured to.<br /><br />While this is an excellent lesson about early New England history and mores, it failed to grab me in the manner of Ms. Brook's earlier People of the Book. Perhaps it was the total sweep of history and cultures that was revealed bit by bit in that previous book that made me love it, everything from contemporary times to Jewish persecution in Spain during the Inquisition to Arab scholars in World War II.

It was also light in tone, humorous and pretty wild when it came to space adventures. I found it to be philosophical and slightly absurdist approach to discussing serious \"world issues\" in a \"oh well, that's what it is\" manner.<br />  What didn't quite work for me were the characters. I was having a hard time liking anyone. I didn't like Jenny very much mostly because while she has done terrible things in the past, we meet her at a point where she's past those and trying to be nice. There isn't anything terrible about her now and she's sincerely apologetic, but since the horrible stuff she's done is constantly mentioned, I had a weird discourse in my general feelings about her. I guess I wanted to see the struggle, maybe? It's like you'd meet an ex-Nazi character who worked in concentration camps a few years back, but now he's all good, doing the right stuff, saying the right things... And that\u2019s your protagonist. (It was very much Jenny\u2019s story, more so than Gary\u2019s).<br />I didn't particularly like Gary either. Reason - Gary didn't have much of a personality. He was as flat, emotionless and languid as they come. Now one could argue if that's because Gary is part-unicorn and maybe they aren't very emotional beings, so we have this effect, or maybe it's just Gary himself, yet we get this part good guy part doormat combination that wasn't very appealing. Ricky is morally ambiguous and very questionable, helping you one moment and selling your momma out next\u2026Honestly, no one got much affection from me when it came to characters, besides dwarfs maybe. I'm usually having a hard time with books like that.<br />This issue aside, it was well-written and had some good thoughts on different social, racial and political problems presented as a sci-fi wild romp, without being preachy.

On pages 1-2, Anna is walking to find her pony, Prince.  She is wearing blue overalls with a bib and straps that cover her shoulders.  By the time she gets to the small herd on pages 3-4, she is now wearing brown pants and somehow there's a sweater involved according to the text.  Prince has a blue streak flashing out of his open mouth, which is supposed to be his tugging on a sweater, although his mouth is open and the \"sweater\" seems to be coming from UNDER Anna's short-sleeve shirt--and an open mouth equals no tugging.  The rest of the story has no illustrator-author incongruities.<br /><br />We do learn from the story how a horse has to develop trust in a handler, a handler needs patience with a horse, and how some horses are easily spooked by unfamiliar sights and sounds.  It is a warm story about a young girl (including her grandmother) who has set her sites on a particular yet-to-be-ridden young pony, and a human-pony friendship that is beginning to develop.<br /><br />I did not find the unfolding of the story dramatic or heart-tugging.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "... this book to read this week - and I love cookbooks! I have quite a few of them", "text": "I got this book to read this week - and I love cookbooks! I have quite a few of them, and always prefer books with clear photos of the dishes described. It helps me when I am choosing a recipe to prepare. If I can't see the picture, and I am not familiar with the dish, I have to carefully read the recipe, and try to imagine, which I don't always have time to do. Also, when we are talking cookbooks, we judge them by the pictures. We cannot smell the food, we cannot taste it yet, so we have to use our vision sense to help us imagine, and smell the dish if you will. If something is not photographed right, you can usually still have a feel of what it would be, but if there is no picture at all - it is just hard to imagine what the book is telling you to do. No pictures next to recipes is a major downfall of this book.<br /><br />Now, there are some pictures as dividers of chapters but they are not named, and it is hard to see what recipe they actually represent. This book looks more like an old-fashioned cookbook without those key pictures. Even bloggers like myself with no budget, and passable photography skills can take pictures to show. I understand the author has no budget for photography but should have made a better effort - I could take pictures for free just to be mentioned in the book! I am sure a lot of other starting out photographers would do it - and it is not hard, you are going to cook those dishes anyways, why not take pictures?<br /><br />Here is what I like about the book - it gives a recipe of homemade garam masala, even several versions of it. This mix is essential for Indian cooking, and it helps to see this book's version as it is such a great spice to have - I use it a lot, I buy mine pre-mixed, but when I get to a point of having more time for cooking I will definitely consult this book for advice!<br /><br />One recipe that I also find to be more of a filler is the recipe of plain basmati rice. This is a specialized cookbook. I can find how to cook rice on the package of rice, or look it up. I don't really need to be taught how to make rice in a specialized book - this is an easy recipe, and too basic to list in my opinion, or it shouldn't take the whole page, but be a part of a recipe that uses rice like pilaf. I don't know, that's my opinion.<br /><br />Other than these comments, I think the recipes in the book are very regional, sound delicious, and it is great to be able to learn and share the knowledge of the chef by trying these out - sounds like a lot of family and regional secrets revealed in this book, so my trips to my favorite Indian restaurants are going to be less now since I can simply cook all of those dishes myself - and I trust they will turn out!

However, this book sat at about more of a fifth grade level, complete with cute (and I do mean cute in a nice sense, not a derogatory one) little pictures every couple dozen pages. It didn't help the age level when the main character and her sidekicks were also in elementary school. I haven't read a book from the perspective of an innocent little kid in a long time and it was a hard adjustment.<br /><br />It had an atypical feel for a fairytale retelling, in that it seemed so innocent and young and naive. Even though the basis for this story is a little darker, the book seemed relatively happy and simple. It just simply wasn't suited for the age group it's sold to. I gave it to my little sister who was twelve at the time and told her to read it and tell me what she thought. She read it, shrugged and said it was a simple, easy read. She didn't dislike the book, but she wasn't crazy about it either.<br /><br />A simple, innocent read for younger children in elementary school is basically what this book is. It's not a bad book and there's nothing inherently wrong with the storytelling or characters, it's just young.", "images": [], "asin": "0062015052", "parent_asin": "0062015052", "user_id": "AGFXCRUOJGV7TEMBLX3ODZQTAFVQ", "timestamp": 1365693714000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The Lesser(?) of Two Evils", "text": "The time is in the distant future. There are several human empires in the galaxy. Two of them are at odds with each other and neither is a particularly thrilling choice.<br /><br />On the one hand, the \"Risen Empire\" is ruled by an emperor who has been dead for centuries. He was once a doctor who tried desperately to save his kid sister from a fatal disease. He succeeds, sort of. He finds a way to introduce a \"parasite\" that keeps the body animated and the mind active after death. He tries it on himself in a grand suicide and then bestows this gift on his sister. The result is immortality after a fashion. Another result is raw power. By being able to bestow immortality on selected people, he is acclaimed as emperor. The living now have to maintain the overhead of an increasingly large population of the dead.<br /><br />Another empire which sprang from humanity is very different. It is one of artificial intelligences of planetary scope. These intelligences exist only to propagate themselves throughout the galaxy. A faction of humanity worships these intelligences and has in turn been modified by them.<br /><br />As the book opens, the cyborgs have attacked an imperial planet in an effort to seed a mind. In doing so, they have captured the sister of the emperor and the imperial fleet is in place to try and stop this propagation. They do manage to defeat the hostage takers but not before the mind is seeded or the imperial sister is killed. The emergent mind learns a secret about the emperor before its commandos are killed. We never learn what that secret is but the mind will do anything to get its one remaining commando into a position to transmit the information to one of its ships still in place. The emperor is so frightened by this possibility that he will sacrifice anyone and anything to prevent it.<br /><br />Caught in the middle are two principle persons. One is the captain of the ship tasked to attack the cyborg ship and the other is his lover, a powerful senator of the opposition.<br /><br />The book is well written and keeps interest throughout. It posits some interesting ideas and has a good story. The fact that we don't know what the secret is makes for a minor irritation but the only real problem is the ending. The stage is set for a confrontation between the captain's little ship and the alien behemoth. The stage is set but the actors never get where they are going. We will have to wait for the next book to learn anything.", "images": [], "asin": "0765305550", "parent_asin": "0765305550", "user_id": "AGBHMH5GOCFXKTD4FFKJUATMN2BA", "timestamp": 1157687863000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

While main plot won't rock your socks off with originality and complexity, I believe that this book actually never meant to do it in the first place. It doesn't have any pretenses on being something important or significant; the strength of &#34;TLOUC&#34; lies in the humor of it, which is extremely self-deprecating, yet innocent at the same time.

Unfortunately, the book as a whole was like eating cotton candy:  sweet and tasty but not filling.<br /><br />Strachan, who is a hockey journalist and a good friend of Gretzky, certainly provided some glimpses under the curtain (or under the ice if you will), but for the most part it is just a regurgitation of Wayne\u2019s many achievements and almost reads like a lifetime achievement award video.  The information skips around, touches on elements and then moves on with little additional analysis or  substantive counter points of view.<br /><br />After Gretzky\u2019s short time in St. Louis (that debacle was an interesting), Strachan chooses to focus more on Wayne\u2019s involvement with the World Cup and Olympics (interesting and deserving of discussion) ignoring his time in New York. \u00a0As a Ranger fan I was looking forward to some glimpses into this tenure of his career. \u00a0The book\u2019s only Ranger focus was on his last game and when he decided to retire.<br /><br />Strachan\u2019s close relationship with Gretzky also made the read slightly tedious with his constant praise and biased view. \u00a0I am surprised the title of the book wasn\u2019t \u201cGretzky: \u00a0A March Towards Sainthood\u201d. \u00a0Granted, the man was a great player, ambassador, and is seemingly a genuinely decent guy off the ice, but there were too many times when Strachan would blame the failures of other people if Gretzky didn\u2019t achieve \u201cgreatness\u201d, or ignore many of the contributions of other people in helping Gretzky when he did achieve \u201cgreatness\u201d.  I could practically hear Jan from the Brady bunch just screaming \u201cGretzky, Gretzky, Gretzky\u201d instead of Marsha\u2019s name.<br /><br />I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it but I did enjoy reading about Gretzky\u2019s contribution to hockey, his many individual accomplishments, and his passion to help spread the love of the game. \u00a0However, I would have liked a more objective view with more insight from other players, coaches, and NHL personnel to give a more rounded perspective of certain times during his career.", "images": [], "asin": "0771083386", "parent_asin": "0771083386", "user_id": "AEM4JQ2VJH5HOB7YA4U5CFYEHXUA", "timestamp": 1423191689000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

There is noone lining up behind these \"leaders.\"<br />3) No proven aptitude with any issue of importance.<br />4) Wealth - All recent PMs went to Eton, where they dreamt of the day they could grab this role; not, where they dreamt of any societal fixes.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Unsatisfying ending...", "text": "I don't really know how to even begin this review. I didn't dislike the book so much as I felt like it was incomplete and therefore, unsatisfying.<br /><br />First, we have our sexy hero, Jake, who was bitten by a creature several years ago and now has to lock himself in a cage every time the moon is full because he is a werewolf and is afraid he'll harm or kill someone. Despite his \"love 'em and leave 'em\" approach to women, he's a good guy at heart. He's only ever been really drawn to one woman and it was after that one night they shared that he was bitten, and he's never seen her again.<br /><br />Enter the new day camp coordinator, Josie, and of course, our hero's long lost obsession. She's got a tragic past, and is living the dreams of her deceased husband instead of her own. Turns out he was killed by some creature out in the wild four years ago. She hasn't gotten over it or beyond it and she's not looking for any kind of entanglement. Especially not with Jake, who tormented her in elementary school with snakes.<br /><br />On the night the moon is full, she happens to stop by his office. Before he can make leave, the change is upon him. He tells her to lock him in his cage even as he is changing before her eyes. Her shock prevents her from locking the cage.....and it's a darn good thing, because another wolf pops up and seems intent on killing her. Our hero gets out of his cage, and engages the other wolf in a bloody fight.Josie passes out in the cage, having locked herself in for protection from both of them.<br /><br />And thats it.  Well, there is the struggle of their relationship, her coming to grips with his werewolf condition, his coming to grips with the fact that he might just love her. Some steamy sex. The fact that maybe Josie has been the target all along, not Jake and not her deceased husband. Unfortunately, the author never fully fleshes out this side of the story. Very little time is spent on the the attempt on her life, the mysterious wolf Jake fought, or really even anything to do with Jake's condition. The story ends with a short epilogue but it answers no questions (and I had several)and it didn't have the feel of a book that was being set up for a series.<br /><br />For a paranormal romance, there isn't a whole lot of that aspect to the story. Jake's change is pretty much the extent of it. Hard core paranormal readers who like Laurell K Hamilton, Lora Leigh, Christine Feehan or Sherrilyn Kenyon will likely be disappointed with that. The relationship aspect of the story is well done and the love scenes are steamy.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Yawn...", "text": "Sick Little Monkeys details the career of Ren & Stimpy\u2019s eccentric and rebellious creator John Kricfalusi, who has been described by many as either an animation genius or a creative control freak. Mr. K always insisted on doing things his way whether his bosses agreed with him or not. The byproduct of his madness was cartoons that embraced toilet humor, bodily horror, and an uncaring attitude towards the youths they were marketed to. John K made many enemies during his time creating cartoons, but it begs the question of whether or not it was all worth it given the cult following Ren & Stimpy had and still has today.<br /><br />I swore I would finish this book all the way through, but the repetitive and dull writing style makes it impossible to do so. Many of the same talking points were shoved down my throat over and over again whether it was John K\u2019s rebelliousness, his inability to meet deadlines, his cartoons\u2019 disgustingness, and worst of all, how \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d competing cartoons were. About the last item on that list, it would appear as if the author was taking sides with John K, but there were also times when he criticized the animator with as much venom as he did the competitors. If this book has a message, it was lost a long time ago the minute the writing style bored me to tears.<br /><br />Perhaps the writing style could have been improved with some showing instead of telling. Instead of telling me how \u201cbad\u201d other cartoons are, show me what specifically made them that way. But of course, the author couldn\u2019t do that without alienating the laymen of the animation world. Insider terms are used a lot in this book, which would have been fine if the book was marketed to professional animators as opposed to merely fans of Ren & Stimpy. I went into this read wanting to learn about the cartoon that made my childhood a happy time of my life. Instead all I got was technical drivel combined with a desert-dry writing style.<br /><br />The closest the author ever got to showing instead of telling was pictures scattered here and there of John K\u2019s sketches and storyboards. While pictures are always more effective at communicating than words, if that was all I wanted, I would have watched a movie. I wanted to read a book and use my imagination, an imagination guided by an author who\u2019s supposed to be as entertaining as he is informative. I would have even settled for a graphic novel if that\u2019s what the author really wanted. At least with a graphic novel, it wouldn\u2019t feel like my eyes were being dragged across sandpaper. Now there\u2019s a visual worthy of a Ren & Stimpy episode!<br /><br />This was not a fun book to read and I can\u2019t recommend it to my friends. I tried. I really tried. I wanted to like it and become a more educated person because of the reading experience. But no matter what, it just wouldn\u2019t happen. I\u2019d already known John K was a little off-color and this book does a good job of illustrating his depravity, but ultimately it\u2019s not enough to keep my interest.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "A Typical Libertarian Manifesto  ( with a trust fund)", "text": "Much of the book is taken up by an exhaustive listing of how the &#34;regulatory state&#34; has taken away our liberty. This is sadly true but it has been presented in earlier and more interesting works such as Philip K Howard's &#34;the Death of Common Sense&#34;.<br />Murray's only original idea is legal defense fund for individuals and business owners who fall prey to the capricious regulatory system. This is a great idea and if the book ended there it would have been a valuable pamphlet.<br />However Murray goes on to present a (very interesting) description of US demographics starting with the founding in the early 1600s, which he then uses to support the idea that America is best when it is diverse - in the sense of everyone letting everyone else do whatever they want. Here is where the classic libertarian ideology slyly presents itself.  While carefully avoiding direct statement he proposes that the liberal &#34;blue&#34; urban areas be allowed to embrace homosexual marriage and legalized drugs while the conservative &#34;red&#34; counties not be forced to comply. He repeatedly states that everyone be allowed to live &#34;as they see fit&#34;. This is his definition of Liberty.<br />Murray's highest praise is for the internet which allows freedom of choice in consumption and expression of ideas.  Here also the amoral libertarian view becomes obvious. He does not take into account a human nature that often chooses what is bad. The first growth sectors of the internet marketplace were gambling and pornography, and the internet &#34;marketplace of ideas&#34; is recruiting Jihadis from  American suburbs.<br />At one point he makes a remark about the poor behavior of some students in American schools and how common sense would dictate that these students be expelled so that others can learn in a safe environment..  While trying to make a point about free choice Murray unconsciously reveals the central problem with American society - that while we can usually identify what is bad( crime and violence), we are increasingly losing the ability to agree about what is GOOD,", "images": [], "asin": "0385346514", "parent_asin": "0385346514", "user_id": "AGHCDSDMCEB23LYKRPOEUOR6DQWA", "timestamp": 1438091558000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Disappointingly difficult to read - and the content is disjointed", "text": "It saddens me that I cannot award this effort more than 3 stars. There is no question that the author is making a sincere, earnest attempt to produce a useful beginner's  instructional manual for Artisteer, a specialty program for web template creation that has a moderate learning curve.<br /><br /> Unfortunately English is not Jakub Sanecki's first language and Packt Publishing did not provide extensive editing, with particular attention to syntax and composition.<br /><br /> The result is prose that simply doesn't flow well. The language is clunky and difficult to read. Worse is that the author's approach is disjointed, jumping from subject to subject. This approach frequently left me confused. The author is clearly trying to take this moderately complex application and render it accessible to a new user. The Artisteer manual itself will accomplish that purpose - but it will take several careful readings and a lot of experimentation.<br /><br /> Sanecki's book is simply difficult to read. For example: \"Shapes are graphic objects (in the form of geometric figures) that you can insert into the header.\" The parenthetical that shapes are \"geometric figures\" is redundant and superfluous considering that there are two illustrations depicting shapes on the facing page. The use of illustrations is also problematic. They are straight screenshots, occasionally with a single line caption below. The illustrations could have been made vastly more effective by providing numbered callouts describing the various operations being discussed.<br /><br /> There are valuable and helpful hints and tips scattered throughout, but their presence does not compensate for the language and lack of editing. There are also glaring omissions, such as not pointing out that you cannot directly create a two-line headline in a title block, a big issue for many, including me. You have to modify the code outside of Artisteer.<br /><br /> Overall, the author has clearly made an effort to help the user new to Artisteer. But considering the high cost for this relatively thin book, one might be better advised to make their way through the Artisteer manual - twice if necessary - and try things out along the way.<br /><br />Jerry", "images": [], "asin": "1849699410", "parent_asin": "1849699410", "user_id": "AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA", "timestamp": 1383195021000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Boring", "text": "This is easily the most boring book I ever attempted to read. I wasted one evening trying to like it. I even committed the cardinal sin of book reading by skipping ahead to see if it improved over time. No such luck. It was consigned to \"the thrift store basket\" the next morning (today as a matter of fact). I was very disappointed as I had read \"The Omnivores Dilemma\" by the same author and found it wonderfully interesting and thought provoking and was looking for more of the same.<br /><br />This book is not about gardening. It is about the authors philosophy regarding gardening and how that developed along with his garden. This book is extremely cerebral. Too highbrow for my tastes. I was hoping for an amusing anecdotal tale of how a beginning gardener battled the forces of evil (pests,weeds and soil) in New England ground that had never seen a real garden before.<br /><br />Instead, for example, I was treated to pages upon pages of philosophical discussion of the place of Lawn in Americas cultural and societal structure and how how our Lawn differs from that of the English in terms of fenced and walled vs not fenced and not walled and the reason for Americas break from the English method-revolt. Not to mention the place, or lack thereof, of Lawn in the garden schema.<br /><br />We are similarly treated to more pages regarding the philosophy of eliminating pests in the garden be they flora or fauna. Not to mention the sexual enticement of the Rose-but not any rose-only a old world rose will do-not a ridiculous modern hybrid tea rose. Really?<br /><br />However other reviews indicate that other people like it. And, according to the book cover, it is listed as being among some horticultural society's 75 most important gardening books of all time. So what do I know.<br /><br />I do know one thing. That buying books on line because they \"sound good\" cannot take the place of actually looking at them in a real bookstore.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Political Thriller without the Thrill", "text": "President Charlotte Kramer has just won reelection for a second term after breaking from tradition and choosing a member of the opposition party as her vice presidential running mate instead of the incumbent from her first term. Now only weeks into her term, she and others are noticing some problems with Tara Meyers, the new vice president. She's not as focused on the policies and issues as she needs to be, is canceling appearances, and working from home frequently. Staffers are starting to ask questions, and members of the press are digging for answers.<br /><br />The premise of this near-future political thriller was an interesting one, tracing the ripple effects of a possibly impaired elected member of the federal government and how that could spawn investigations, grand juries, and special councils that impact not only the politician in question but the administration itself. Unfortunately the execution of the idea was not handled in such a way that did it justice.<br /><br />Much of the punch of the story is removed in the first few pages of the book when Tara Meyers's household goods are being packed and moved from the vice president's official residence. So the reader already knows the outcome, just not whether her removal from the office was voluntary or forced. After that, most of the book becomes a look back at how things got to that point and removes the suspense from the story.<br /><br />The focus of much of the book is centered around the vice president's senior adviser, Dale Smith. Again since the final outcome is already known by the reader, Dale's observations and concerns seem less of a shock, as do those of all the other White House characters and members of the press and Congress.<br /><br />Another failing of the book was the big build up of the congressional battles being faced by the president on account of her vice presidential choice, yet the reader is not given the payoff of her testimony to stave off impeachment proceedings or that of others' testimony in grand jury hearings. As a result, the story ends in more of a fizzle than the big bang that the situation would inspire. The inside, dramatic details are omitted leaving the reader with an unsatisfying experience. The outcome was revealed from the beginning, so there is not even a mystery left to fall back on.<br /><br />Not recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "1451610963", "parent_asin": "1451610963", "user_id": "AHKVCPZTICIDUMFGKSTZAVCBCBWQ", "timestamp": 1471981086000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The statistics and facts stated in this book should not be overlooked.", "text": "I would probably give this book 3.5 stars if I could. It's definitely somewhere in between 3 and 4 stars.<br /><br />I picked up this book because I happed to agree with the author. As anyone in Corporate America knows these days, leading or managing people isn't what it used to be - even 10 years ago. Things have changed - and continue to change drastically - as global economy takes over more and more everyday. Personally, I am on the fence about this global economy. On one hand, I think it's good that goods & services can be traded around the world - it invites more competition and provide people with goods & services that they might not have otherwise. On the other hand, it doesn't do much for job growth, particularily in the U.S. where trade laws remain unprotected, if looking at it from a labor workers' point of view. But that's what great about this book - it literally loads you with facts about countries, the population of the world overall, different types of economies (Capitalism, Communism, Socialism), and provides you with the good & bad of each, allowing you to make up your own mind about if the end of power is a step forward or a step backward.<br /><br />Some of the reviews state that this reads like a textbook - and it does. However, the facts that were researched in this book cannot be dismissed, as the author has obviously completed some SERIOUS fact-checking & researching. And, the fact that a lot of what he says in the book (written in 2006), has actually come to fruition in 2015. I think as most people read this book they will agree with the facts that the author points out, especially if your a leader or someone in management.<br /><br />I will disagree with a quote on the back cover that states that the book &#34;will change my views on how I see and read the news&#34;. This is not a true fact. As one should realize by now, most of the news station broadcasts are done so by corporations that own them, so people should know that the news is already biased, so I'm not quite sure why one would think that from reading this book.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good read with some fascinating statistics in it.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "\"The stiffs. The corpses. In the morgue. They've come back to life.\"", "text": "\"Handling the Undead\" is a zombie book. But not the typical gory, horrendous BRAAAAAAINSSSS-craving type. Instead John Ajvinde Lindquist slowly weaves together an intelligent, philosophical look at what would happen if the dead were to unnaturally rise from their graves... and the only flaw is that the middle section of the book is so SLOW.<br /><br />Something strange is happening in Stockholm -- the weather is oppressive, electrical glitches are everywhere, and everybody has a headache.<br /><br />But when the strange conditions vanish, everybody who has died within the last two months rises from the morgue, funeral homes, and even their coffins. The \"reliving\" wander back to their old homes, mute and seemingly unaware, shocking their loved ones. And of course, the government quickly rounds them up and confines them, until they can be sure what dangers the \"reliving\" might pose.<br /><br />In the days that follow, Lindqvist follows five people whose loved ones have come back -- a comedian sunk deep in denial about his wife being gone, a wannabe-rebel teen, a grandfather and a young mother trying to help her undead son \"recover,\" and a widow who believes that she has a mission from the Virgin Mary. But something else is approaching Stockholm, bringing unexpected effects in its wake.<br /><br />\"Handling the Undead\" doesn't really focus on the zombies themselves. Instead, Lindqvist conjures up a simple scenario, and examines how people would react to it -- we see hysteria, suicide, denial, dismissal, religious fervor, and a delusional belief that the zombies can simply go back to their old lives. And he brings up a number of philosophical questions with no easy answers.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this book is that it should have been much smaller. Lindqvist spends most of the book's middle section spinning his wheels, with nothing really happening. And we never really find out WHY the dead rose, just that it is somehow an error.<br /><br />Fortunately the beginning and ending are filled with subtle, creeping psychological horror (the whole scene with the grotesque drowned zombie is nauseating), as well as the painful scene where David and Magnus meet Eva again. And there's an exquisite metaphysical edge, which implies that there's more out there than just zombies -- think an elusive, benevolent figure with fishhook fingertips.<br /><br />Lindqvist also fleshes out his characters beautifully, giving each one a backstory that shapes their current reactions. And he handles each one with compassion, even if they're delusional or twerpy. Among the best are David (desperately clinging to hope and unable to grieve), Flora (a rather annoying a teen who thinks she's an iconoclast), and Anna (whose son Elias has \"come back\") -- and even some of the zombies show a glimmer of personality.<br /><br />\"Handling the Undead\" is a deeply flawed book -- the entire middle section is bogged down.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Too Much Knowledge is Insufficient", "text": "\u201cThe Age of EM: Work, Love, and Life When Robots Rule the Earth, is Robin Hanson\u2019s vision of what will happen when humans are able to create the equivalent of the human brain complete with the full spectrum of rational and emotional intelligence. A heavily footnoted volume, Hanson wants to legitimize his interpretation of the past history of human development and continue that transition as robot intelligence rises to the next evolutionary level and humans essentially fade into a peripheral existence.<br /><br />One of the positives of this volume is that the author has been willing to engage with his critics as evidenced by a number of his responses to postings to the reviews on the Amazon.com website. The concerning issue is the author\u2019s response to the 150 or so critics that he cites, and dismisses, in the book, primarily, with the rationale that most, supposedly colleagues, whom he believes are more interested in history, are seemingly indifferent to the \u201cfuture\u201d, at least the far future where computers are able to emulate humans, as suggested by the title, The Age of EM.<br /><br />Hanson wants to legitimize his analysis or predictions by his adoption of a heavily footnoted, academic style, while simultaneously dismissing others who have adopted a narrative often cast in the genre of science fiction.  What he fails to understand, and denies leveraging, is that much of the analysis of artifacts and scientific research are also woven into \u201cstories\u201d. In fact, Yuval Harari\u2019s \u201cSapiens\u201d makes the strong case that what is responsible for human progress is language and the ability to tell \u201cstories\u201d.<br /><br />Hanson has a strong history of research and development in the hard sciences and information technology and if he had focused that knowledge to take the global research and carefully develop a scenario to show the pathway to machines that can emulate human brains one would have an understanding of the current and needed directions to a promised realization. But, one suspects that such a book would have limited readership, and only within a select community. This is clear where the author makes the distinction between machine emulations and what he sees as a weaker research arena, artificial intelligence which, today, is in ascendance and which has captured the imagination across academic disciplines and the commercial sector, globally.<br /><br />The author\u2019s intellectual path took an orthogonal turn into the social sciences, particularly, economics. Herein lies the fatal flaw in the book\u2019s thesis. Unlike fiction, particularly science fiction, the book does not have a cohesive story, with the exception that the volume is written from and within a western cultural paradigm with seemingly a conventional neoclassical economic perspective. The book creates a very sketchy evolutionary model from foraging to farming to industrialization. And there it stops. It is a standard western rendering. While there are copious references, they are selective and many of these taken within their academic frame are, themselves, not necessarily without their own controversies and accepted interpretations.<br /><br />More importantly, in an age of \u201cEM\u201d with the wired equivalent of Teilhard de Chardin\u2019s Noosphere, it is questionable whether that cultural mold can hold.  In fact, in an academic environment characterized by ever narrowing disciplinary focus, scholars may less readily accept the selective citations as rationales.<br /><br />Hanson eschews the idea of fictional stories, yet he uses this model to selectively pick potential traits of his EM\u2019s in some distant future, one that looks much like North America or Europe with its current culture and economy. It is as if all the work in creating EM\u2019s will yield a 1:1 socioeconomic and personality matching of the current middle class and that world is the future. Hanson seems to believe that by playing the academic and selectively, but extensively, documenting his narrative that it avoids the idea that his \u201cstory\u201d takes credence over the metaphorical world relegated to science fiction, at least in validating his concept of what EM\u2019s will be and how they will function in the evolution beyond our current industrial models.<br /><br />The fatal flaw is trying to treat a complex bio/physical/socio/economic system with a rational/scientific model. Hold constant all variables except the one under investigation. In this case, humans create EM\u2019s and then they are written into fringe obscurity devoid of any advancement since EM\u2019s fulfill those niches in both the mundane and the creative, except for leisure. Somehow that which drives humans to create EM\u2019s and the world up to the manifestation of EM\u2019s is exorcized. Somehow the current economic models now under evolutionary pressure by what has been defined as heterodox thinking, and tied to the growing environmental concerns with global warming and many other issues, remain frozen until EM\u2019s with their superior processing and advanced physical capabilities reach consciousness.<br /><br />While Hanson tries to inject some emotion into the EM\u2019s, since they are emulations of the human brain, his one-dimensional focus on pleasure with sexual relations, artificially induced in electromechanical systems, fails. He, like many of those he criticizes, fails to release the single vision constraints by assuming that all EM\u2019s, except for \u201cwork\u201d have the same socio/cultural homogeneity. Issues such as minority rights, religious differences and global cultural tensions across individual and geo/political boundaries disappear, probably because humans have become socio/political eunuchs or perhaps, as in the movie, The Matrix, all are fed the \u201cblue pill\u201d in their diets and live in a dream world.<br /><br />Rudy Rucker is another scientist who has crossed the academic boundaries but, unlike Hanson, has, also, written in the science fiction genre. His substantive work, The Ware Tetrology, carries EM\u2019s into the time when they inhabit biological forms resembling humans and who eventually seek citizenship along side of humans. Rucker, Stephenson in his \u201cDiamond Age\u201d, David Brin in the Hanson cited \u201cKiln People\u201d and a number of science fiction writers have taken, as has Hanson, that EM\u2019s will be constructed.  But they have removed the social constraints.<br /><br />In many ways Hanson has adopted the same conservative idea of the distant future of his critics, by constraining his \u201cstory\u201d to that which can be footnoted or which can be molded within the current collegial fabrications.  This review is being written in 2016 during the current presidential race in the United States. One understands the potential global ramifications at a time when the Middle East is in the midst of violent culture and political discord.<br /><br />Similarly, the issues resulting from the 2008 financial meltdown have not been resolved and the international finance communities are also in a quandary. One can readily understand why it may not be thinking about the future that is the problem, but rather it\u2019s the cognitive dissonance in the attempt to academically rationalize this analysis into its reductionist format.", "images": [], "asin": "0198754620", "parent_asin": "0198754620", "user_id": "AHUARC4SOYQZXL4G4OEPNO62VWNA", "timestamp": 1478534745000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Revisionist history at its best and at its worst", "text": "This is a very interesting, and at times fascinating book about the Roman disaster at Carrhae and the death of Crassus, arguably the most powerful member of the first triumvirate (the other two being Pompey and Caesar) in 53 BC at the hands of the Parthians commanded by Surena.<br /><br />To begin with (and although most of the source discussion is pushed back into an appendix), the author has definitely studied and well-researched his subject. He has also identified the rather negative - and often implausible - biases contained in these sources, in particular in Plutarch, whose moralising agenda seems, once again, to have been privileged over historical accuracy.<br /><br />The main interest of the book lies in the portray that it paints of Crassus, and the explanations that the author provides with the awful reputation that this \"loser\" acquired in Roman literature, a reputation that has mostly prevailed to this day. Gareth Sampson strenuously and valiantly attempts to rehabilitate the reputation of the vanquished Roman warlord who paid the disaster with his life. In particular, he makes a number of convincing points showing that Crassus was a highly efficient, successful and experienced Roman senator with a colossal fortune, huge political experience, vast political connections and significantly more military experience that he is usually credited for. Moreover, although about sixty years old when he left on his Parthian campaign, he was far from senile and very much at the top of his campaign.<br /><br />Regarding his military experience, he was the real victor of Spartacus' slave rebellion, although Pompey managed to get some of the credit for it, in one of his usual exercises of one-upmanship. As the author shows, this was no mean feat in itself, even if the Romans did not consider that military victories over slaves were worthy of triumphs. He was also Sylla's right hand man and he had saved the day for his boss, almost a decade before, as Sylla and his army fought the faction of Marius at the gates of Rome.<br /><br />As the author admits, he also had some more unsavoury sides which gave him a reputation for avarice and greed. This, however, may have been at least in part the result of defamation by his enemies because he seems to have used money as a weapon to bride, but also as a means to increase his political influence and to extract favours from those who owed him. Among other uses, his huge fortune attracted to him a clientele of young, ambitious, competitive and ruthless scions of senatorial families, of which Julius Caesar was but one. This feature, as shown in the book, meant that he could select the senior officers for his Parthian campaign from among the best of the competitive and aggressive young senators.<br /><br />The author also does a good job when explaining the reasons that Crassus had to go on such a campaign: military glory was a key element in becoming, or, in Crassus' case, in maintaining his position among the top men in Rome. He needed it, especially since Caesar was acquiring masses of it in Gaul. Moreover, he also needed to trump Pompey, who had acquired his glory and fame in the very same place (Syria) a decade before and was highly popular in Rome, unlike Crassus. Sampson also does, in my view, mostly a good job in showing that, contrary to what the main sources imply or sometimes state, Crassus' preparations were thorough and meticulous. He was known for his prudence and organisation and he recruited a vast army which he thoroughly trained to the extent that it was largely (but not only) made up of recruits.<br /><br />This is, however, the point where the author starts going too far, in my view. First he attempts to find all sorts of excuses for Crassus and tries to exonerate him from any responsibility in the disaster, including an attempt to shift the blame on Cassius Longinus (one of Caesar's future assassins), one of his lieutenants and the only one who survived whom he accuses of cowardice and of abandoning Crassus in particular. He also attempts to justify each and every of Crassus' decisions and tries to show that, under the circumstances, it was the best option. Some choices may be debatable. One can argue as to whether choosing a different route would have been preferable, bearing in mind that less than twenty years later Marc Antony chose to invade through Armenia with an even larger force and barely avoided a disaster of even greater proportions.<br /><br />In other cases, however, exonerating Crassus seems much more difficult. These include, in particular, the inability of his forces to cope with Parthian cavalry and the mistakes made in offering to his enemy exactly the kind of terrain and battle which maximised their advantages while cancelling those of the Roman legionaries. As another reviewer has noted, this is where Gareth Sampson is forced to resort to speculation and attempts to make Surenas, the Parthian commander, into some kind of military genius. Allegedly, he carefully analysed the Roman army, planned a brilliant strategy accordingly and build up his own force accordingly in order to overwhelm it.<br /><br />As this reviewer noted, this is very unlikely and I would add that it is largely incorrect. There was simply nothing original in Surenas' all-cavalry force made up of horse archers and heavy lance cavalry. All Scythe and Sarmatian tribes had been organized in such armies for centuries from the Danube and the Black Sea and Central Asia. Moreover, such forces were not exactly new either. The Parthians conquered Mesopotamia and defeated the Seleucid armies almost a century before using the very same tactics. These tactics were typical of the Scythes (to which the Parthians were related), and of steppe nomads more generally. They had been used for hundreds of years.<br /><br />In reality, the author's attempt to make Surenas into a \"military genius\" seems to be an attempt to cover-up Crassus' dismal intelligence failures and the fact that he grossly underestimated and possibly even despised his enemy. He was aware of the need for him to have some good and reliable cavalry but started off with too few of them (the 1000 Gallic cavalry who were massacred with his son, the light troops and several cohorts of legionaries when attempting to break the encirclement and come to grips with the Parthians). Moreover, he started the campaign with almost no missile infantry capable of shooting back at the Parthian horse archers without being outranged (only 500 foot archers) or able to inflict any significant damage on the cataphracts (no slingers).<br /><br />Finally, his mixture of typically Roman overconfidence and arrogance, built from constant victories against very different foes, played straight into the Parthians hands. Perhaps in part because of his overwhelming numbers, and because his previous military experiences had been in close contact fighting, he offered the enemy - an all-cavalry force - exactly the kind of battle that they excelled at. At the very least, and as another author mentioned, there was from the Roman side a complete breakdown in military intelligence for Crassus quite obviously did not even know who he was fighting.", "images": [], "asin": "1932033890", "parent_asin": "1932033890", "user_id": "AGAYTQENQ4WNDQK6CHIVWTCP4PNQ", "timestamp": 1369520748000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

Our main character didn't come from money and was at a point a hard worker and then she married a rich and wealthy husband, course the next part is very cliched - she fell into the role as a rich man's wife and then one day, experienced a tragedy that caused her to wake up from her stupor and discover her whole life was a sham and then she leaves her husband and settles into a small-town where she secretly had brought a fixer-upper cottage for herself. We also learn that due to Grey's life with her husband, the bottle aka alcohol became her best friend and soon she will find herself always needing that next fix, and soon the drinking will cause her to lose everything including a job she did at one time love, but as she won't stoop to the level of the others and sleep with the boss - that was at a standstill too.

Rickie's life develops in ways he initially believes he wants, but that ultimately end up denying him his dreams and diminishing him as a person.<br /><br />Although set in stereotypical English locations of university and boarding school, it is clear that the narrative uses these locations to show their hollow underpinnings. Much of the narrative hinges on the personal disasters and tragedies that expectations, mores, and conventions bring to individuals who fall outside the realm of what is considered acceptable. The book as a whole is much more a send-up of English society than a conventional novel that plays out within its boundaries.<br /><br />For me, none of the characters really connected. They were all ultimately rather unlikable, with some more overtly evil than others. The stylistic choices are also unusual, and the language is generally more associative and based on thoughts and feelings than clearly or linearly structured. At times it is difficult to get a clear sense of each character within the scenes, or an understanding of the sequence of events. I found it an interesting experience to read this kind of language, but was left with the memory of jumbled, bright images, not really a clear recollection. I understand that this was the author's favorite novel he had written, and that there was much in here that was personal and important to him. Perhaps that explains the jumbled impressions and non-idealized characters, if the goal was to write a book more true to life or at least telling some truths about the author.

The characters are likable enough.  Unlike the first in series, this story is not saturated with terminology I had to stop every five minutes to look in the dictionary.

In its hunger for pain and suffering, the Dactyl slowly gathers its evil throng, and finally erupts upon the unwary world in a titanic war of destruction. The reader follows the lives of the three heroes from adolescence through adulthood as they slowly realize that their goal is to warn (or, alternatively, save) the world. The one female and two male heroes are: Jylseponie (Jilly or Pony for short), a girl who loses her memory after her village is burned and ransacked by goblins; Elbryan (&quot;Nightbird&quot;) the Ranger, who, having witnessed the same carnage as Pony, is trained by the elves to become an ultimate warrior; and, finally, Avelyn Desbris, a young monk with phenomenal magic powers who loses faith and escapes with a trove of magic stones, having witnessed the ultimate corruption of his order.<br />To put it plainly, Salvatore seems to lack the sophistication to properly exploit the complicated themes he raises (lost faith, long-lasting trauma, wanderlust, alienation, captivity), and because of this flaw the most involving aspects of the plot become mundane very quickly. An viable alternative would be to flesh out the dark, somber world of the Demon Wars saga, but it is not pursued. His world retains the feeling of modernism and rarely allows the reader to &quot;immerse&quot; himself in the reading. The reader is left dangling between the Scylla of a fragmentary world and the Charybdis of characters that grow flatter as the book progresses.<br />Although generally quick-paced, the chapters are frequently interrupted by overlong, overdescribed skirmishes, where each individual stike and parry gets its own sentence.

Virtually the entire book is a tour of Royal Street in the French Quarter from end to end with a few side trips that take you a block or two away from Royal Street. Other than that, the only exceptions are a very short chapter of the Moon Walk and another short chapter at the end of the book about Esplanade to the U.S. Mint and French Market.  That leaves the vast majority of the French Quarter completely unmentioned, which is a shame, in my opinion.  The title of the book is misleading, to put it mildly. If you are looking for a book about the entire French Quarter, look elsewhere. I'm still looking for such a book. There's so much more of interest in the French Quarter than Royal Street.<br /><br />I'm a bit bewildered by the positive reviews here because none of those reviewers seemed to have noticed that this book only covers a very small part of the French Quarter.<br /><br />BTW, there are numerous errors in the book but not enough that it's a big issue.  At least one address is listed that never existed and never did exist. I have no idea how that error crept into the book because that address follows and existing address that he mentions so it's not a typo. The block ends before it every reaches the number the author mentions as a building of interest. But anyone using this book while touring the French Quarter is probably interested in historical accuracy so they should be warned.  Little errors occur frequently in the book. As just one example, on page 65, the author states that Jackson Square was named in Andrew Jackson's honor in 1851.  Actually, it was named in his honor in 1815.  The statue of Jackson was placed in Jackson Square in 1851.  No big deal but I like to be able to trust information in books like this.<br /><br />It would also have been nice if more of a physical description of the buildings was included to help the reader identify the buildings now because many buildings in the FQ do not have their addresses marked. In one case, the author describes a building as being one of the only buildings in the FQ that is set back from the street with its courtyard in front and yet the building is built right on the street like every other building on the block and there is no courtyard in front. This could cause some head-scratching for the tourist using this book as they walk Royal Street. The only thing I can think of is that an aerial view shows that there is a building set behind the building on the street but the building on the street appears to be very old. Visitors can't see the rear building from the street if that's what the author is referring to. It almost seems as if the author never actually saw the building he is writing about but rather read some account of a building that is behind the building that visitors will see. He never mentions the buildings you will actually see at that address. That's just another example of errors in the book.  For a small book like this, there really is no excuse for these types of errors, in my opinion.  I found several of them when I first received the book and quickly perused the pages before reading it.  A quick proof-read by someone who lives in the FQ would have caught the errors.  If I can spot numerous errors just while scanning over the book before reading it in detail, that's not a good sign, especially since I know very little about the FQ and live in northern Illinois.", "images": [], "asin": "1626192804", "parent_asin": "1626192804", "user_id": "AGBQO7A6MUCQVBUCJR747S2EHBWA", "timestamp": 1417219814000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Unsatisfying and Ultimately Boring", "text": "I bought this book because I  expected to enjoy it, but although I read the whole thing, only one chapter, on the Irish Famine, actually held my interest. The problem with the other chapters is that they are so diffuse that they end up seeming to say almost nothing. The weather, it is a'changin, is the theme, and it is supported by paragraph after paragraph of sweeping generalizations. Yes, there are small anecdotes scattered throughout to enliven the weather-reporting, but in the end, they all blur together.<br /><br />Picture reading a summary of the weather in the United States over the past 10 years, and you will have a very good idea of how this book reads: Some regions experienced extreme cold and snow during the winter, while other areas in the west were dry and sunny.l The springs were warmer than average, rainfall was heavy, and there were hurricanes and tornadoes in the south.  Now stretch that out for page after page and see if your head does not begin to nod.<br /><br />The thesis of the book is that, well, we can't engage in environmental determinism, because that is an academic taboo, but we can say that the climate has changed and that history has happened, and that there seems that there might be a connection. Not very compelling, is it? *Of course* changes in climate *cause* changes in human behavior and thus in history! If the area where you can or cannot grow food changes, then that will perforce change where people live and how they live, and that's history! Was the French revolution caused by the extreme poverty of French peasants, and by the fact that their overlords seemed to have no interest in how they produced the food they all needed? Who can doubt it? And does climate affect the ability to grow food? Obviously!<br /><br />The one chapter that really hung together was An Ghorta Mor, about the Great Hunger in Ireland caused by the failure of the potato crop. For the first time in the whole book, the author slows down and focuses on a single region and a single period of time, rather than sweeping from decade to decade and place to place. And that works. But mostly you read things like, &#34;Weather in northern Europe was extremely cold. The rivers in xyz froze over. New Zealand, meanwhile, was also cold, and there was famine in China.&#34; Just too broad to be of any interest to read.<br /><br />Some people complain about the fact that the author tacks on comments about our current Global Warming controversy (if controversy it is) and appends a chapter at the end making a somewhat half-hearted argument that yes, global warming is real, it is man-made, and it might be bad. I really don't care by the time I get to that chapter, because he has already demonstrated to my satisfaction that the climate has changed many times and we don't really know why. If a Little Ice Age brings suffering, might a warm age actually ameliorate human life in some way? Maybe. Might it spur new technologies? Probably. This is hardly a screed telling me to give up my car and ride a bike to work. All the evidence herein suggests that mainly, we don't know, the patterns are irregular and hard to interpret, and that extreme cold is no picnic for human civilizations.<br /><br />One other point that deserves mention is the choice to use metric measurements throughout the book. Ok, I get it, as Americans, we are the only ones who aren't very familiar with those measurements. But the intro gives false information about the relationship between kilometers and miles. And then throughout the rest of the book, I would have to mentally translate every fact: winters were 2 degrees C. colder, and the glaciers advanced 2.5 kilometers down into the valleys. Often, instead of absolute numbers, we are given comparisons, but all this just makes it hard for me to form a mental image of what it was like. New York was 2 degrees C colder than 10 years before, and there were 28 days of below-zero weather. (Is that below zero C? If so, isn't that pretty much what winter is?)<br /><br />I really expected to be interested in the daily life of Europeans from 1300-1850 and how weather impacted them, but in the end, I didn't feel that I got that. Maybe it's because the facts are just so diffuse--no trend is obvious enough close-up to make much of a picture.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "a few unexpected turns but also suffers from overly familiar element", "text": "(review originally appeared at fantasyliterature.com)<br /><br />Troy Carrol Bucher\u2019s Lies of Descent is the first book in a new trilogy set in a world of magic, fallen gods, clashing cultures, and internal conflict within cultures.  While the writing is solid enough, and Bucher offers up a few unexpected turns, the book suffers from overly familiar elements.<br /><br />Ages ago the gods of light (led by Parron) and darkness (led by Tomu) warred with each other and to prevent that war from wiping out all life, the gods of light sacrificed themselves to drag their foes down with them to mortal lands where their power, though still strong, could not destroy the world. Those mortal descendants with the blood of Parron can wield magic, and the two warring militaristic cultures of the world, the Esharii and Draegorans, both test their youth and then train them (though the Esharii do so only for males).<br /><br />The book opens with 12-year-old Riam being tested by a Draegorian and then collected for training. He\u2019s soon joined by Nola, a young girl who also tested positive, but events intervene before they can reach the island base of the Draegorians, with Nola captured by the Esharii and Riam finding himself sold off into quasi-slavery in a strange city. The other major POV focuses on Ky\u2019lem, close associate to an Esharii warleader whom Ky\u2019lem thinks leads too much with his muscle than his brain.  Ky\u2019lem\u2019s desire to see the tribes unified and adapt to a changing world puts him in some conflict with his friend and eventually sees his life intertwine with Nola\u2019s as an Esharri spirit-walker puts into motion his plans to prevent the horrid future he\u2019s foreseen involving the return of Tomu.<br /><br />The two youngsters come from quite different backgrounds, with Riam living a hard-scrabble farming life with an older brother and a father who regularly beats them both.  Being plucked from that life is therefore a relief to him.  Nola, on the other hand, is the daughter of two loving parents who have raised her in a comfortable, prosperous and pampered lifestyle, and she therefore spends a lot of her early pages complaining about the shift in her fortunes. This doesn\u2019t do her character any benefits, and it seems even the author is somewhat uninterested as the writing in her sections pales in comparison to Riam\u2019s segments.  While Riam gets to help fend off several Esharii attacks, becomes leader of a group of other young candidates, and plots his escape from slavery (as well as take down a villain), Nola mostly gets to stoically deal with being tied up and/or led from place to place. She even spends a chunk of time unconscious.  This does eventually change as she comes into her power, but unfortunately not until toward the end of the novel, leaving her feeling eclipsed by both Riam and Ky\u2019lem for most of the story.  And there\u2019s a strange aging side-effect of that power that seems a bit too contrived to age her up so other elements don\u2019t feel creepy (though I confess they still did) and that also doesn\u2019t get enough examination within the story for such a huge change.<br /><br />The story, as noted in the intro, is also more than a bit familiar, with a war between gods, a young person (or two in this case) learning they\u2019re \u201cspecial\u201d (and then even more special than the other specials) thanks to their blood/background and then getting whisked off from their old life to be trained to use their powers, a patriarchal tribal society, a strictly regimented militaristic organization, an upper-class bully, and so on. Granted, Bucher executes them solidly enough, even tossing a few unexpected turns in there, such as diverting Riam from actually reaching the island, but it still felt overly familiar with little to make it stand out from other novels employing the same tropes.  The same is true with the prose style.  The world-building is thin; I can\u2019t say I really had a great sense of the land and its societies, but the mythology is intriguing if again a bit familiar. On the plus side, Bucher does a quite nice job with physical action, whether in the form of pitched battles, Riam\u2019s slave labor, or arduous journeying.<br /><br />\u201cSolidly comfortable\u201d is the best description I can go with for Lies of Descent. It goes down a well-trod path and doesn\u2019t really deviate enough (at least in book one) to make it stand out from other similar plots/characters, and its portrayal of female characters (not just Nola) unfortunately bends it in the wrong direction. At this point, therefore, I\u2019d hold off until seeing how book two goes.", "images": [], "asin": "B07KVLDQDQ", "parent_asin": "B07KVLDQDQ", "user_id": "AEJIPQY4UD6ZS2ATZPPUSQYEVSQA", "timestamp": 1677309306281, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Great beginning, but I felt cheated by the non-existent ending.", "text": "I am rarely upset about a book. I am excited if I love it and usually just sad or even indifferent if I don't. After all, you can't like them all. Well, this time I'm pissed off with this book. Really, really pissed off! In the Woods had all the makings of a 5 star, all-time favorite book, but those hopes crashed and burned about 2/3 in. Now I feel cheated, like a kid who was promised candy only to discover a piece of rock under all that bright glittering packaging.<br /><br />I realize that I'm not exactly an expert in this genre - I rarely read murder mysteries. I watch plenty of those on TV though. I had picked In the Woods because the premise seemed interesting: Three kids go to play in the woods. Only one of them is found the next morning, wearing bloody shoes and no memory of what happened. Twenty years later, that kid, now a detective in the murder squad, is forced to come back to this town to investigate the murder of another child in the same woods.<br /><br />Now my understanding of the murder mystery genre is that the author and the reader enter into an unspoken pact - if the reader sticks with the story, the author will reveal the mystery in the end. Most of the questions will be answered and the culprits found. The reader will know who had done it, why and how.<br /><br />The biggest mystery in this book is what happened to Peter and Jamie 20 years ago. The book even begins with that disappearance, and Katie's murder comes a few chapters later. So that's the mystery that should be resolved by the end, right?<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />By the time I was maybe 10 pages away from finishing the book, I had the sinking feeling that the author would not answer any of those questions. We will never find out what Rob saw in the woods that night or what became of Peter and Jamie. I had invested hours of my time to read through 400+ pages just to end up with the lukewarm explanation that &#34;some memories are just gone for good, and some mysteries are not meant to be solved.&#34;<br /><br />I realize that in real life that's what happens about 70% of the time. I mean, just look at the amount of cold cases gathering dust in police archives around the world. However, book logic is different. I don't want to get invested in a story that won't give me a resolution. I want to feel a sense of fulfillment after I finish a book, not to feel cheated and frustrated.<br /><br />I'm upset about this because the book has so much potential. It's wonderfully well-written. The prose is just beautiful, and some passages are just poignantly poetic. The protagonist has a strong and interesting voice that I wanted to follow. And his personal involvement with this place just made me want to finally find out what had happened on that fateful day 20 years ago even more\u2026 So I dived into the book head first and fully expected an exceptional read.<br /><br />The alarm bells first went off in my head when Rob decided not to come forward about his identity even when evidence found on the new crime scene linked it to the case of his missing friends. He chose to keep his mouth shut on the fact that Ryan Adams and detective Rob Adams were one and the same person and he reiterated this decision several times during the investigation. I find this decision stupid and irresponsible, because not only does it jeopardize his career, but the whole case as well, since all the evidence he collected will become inadmissible in court if the truth comes out. And his reasoning behind this decision makes less and less sense the further we get into the book.<br /><br />My second problem with In the Woods is Rob's partner Cassie. The way Tana French portrays her, she is &#34;saint&#34; Cassie who can do no wrong. She always has the right hunch about the case. She is smart and beautiful and has a keen understanding of people. Yet she chooses to stick with Rob no matter what he does. Even after that disastrous night, she isn't mad at him for the abject way he starts treating her, but because she lost his friendship and somehow she thinks it's her fault. Really? Hot, smart and sassy girl who is extremely devoted to her abusive boyfriend / friend. Hello trope!<br /><br />But even though I didn't like Cassie and had a tough time with some of Rob's decisions, the story would still have gotten a 4 star review if the author had kept her end of the bargain and actually given me and ending. The fact that it didn't happen was just the last nail in the coffin lid.<br /><br />I'm upset. I won't recommend this book.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "strong three, more than satisfying conclusion to series", "text": "Hour of Need is the concluding book in Michael Pryor's Laws of Magic's series and it brings a good series to a fitting and satisfying close. I won't bother recapping the general premise as you'll want to have read the prior (or should that be Pryor) books first so you can check out the setting etc. in my earlier reviews. Suffice to say it's set in an alternate Edwardian time period that has been moving toward and then finally arriving at their version of World War I involving both technology and magic.<br /><br />All the major characters return for Hour of Need: Aubrey--whom I've described as a mix of Holmes, Tow Swift, and Hermione Granger; his best friend George--reliably strong and warm-hearted; Caroline--his crack shot, martial artist maybe-finally-girlfriend-this-book; and Sophie, coming into her own magically in this book as well as moving more seriously into her relationship with George. As one might expect in the conclusion, the villain--Dr. Tremaine--is here as well, and yes, he and Aubrey do have a final confrontation.<br /><br />The book is darker that the earlier ones in the sense that while the first few were heading into the war and the last one has the group fighting at the fringes, here we see the actual front and it has all the horror as the non-alternate-universe WWI--the trenches, wire fencing, shell-shocked soldiers, are all here and it makes for a nice raising of the stakes as well as some strong, affecting imagery.<br /><br />The grim nature and darker imagery in the middle section strengthen the book, as does the continued development of the relationship among the characters and the movement toward an awareness of the horror of war no matter which side (that isn't to say Pryor offers up any moral relativism here; he simply doesn't shy away from the sometimes monstrous things being done).<br /><br />Hour of Need `s flaws will be familiar to readers of the series--though they are presented as difficult, it still feels that things come a bit too easily or quickly to Aubrey and that's true as well for Sophia, whose magic skills are moving perhaps a bit too fast. Though Pryor still does an excellent job in the presentation of the magic itself as a kind of science in its intellectual rigor. Tremaine remains a bit too abstract, the confrontation is a bit perfunctory, and this book, like others, could have lost 50-75 pages or so.<br /><br />But overall, as mentioned, it's a fitting and satisfactory conclusion. I've called the series \"charmingly old-fashioned\" and it remains so to the end. Too old-fashioned for some I've no doubt, but personally I found it to be one of the series' greatest strengths and, to be fully honest, a bit of a relief amidst all the \"gritty\" or dystopic YA fiction.

The settings are well researched, and I could appreciate some of the very realistic details, but there were obstacles to really being able to suspend my disbelief and become fully immersed in the experience.<br /><br />The main obstacle was Lot himself. I just didn't like him, and since the whole story is from his POV, that was a problem from the start. Then there was the jarring contrast between all the old Biblical terminology with the often totally contemporary tone of Lot's thought processes. \u201cHe gave me the slip at the Deep Hollow spring\u201d suddenly I'm in a Biblical Western. \u201cThere was no shooting star or heavenly choir to guide me\u201d suddenly Christianity already exists even though I'm deep in the Old Testament. \u201cAs if each eyelid weighed several minas.\u201d What?<br /><br />The author can definitely write, but I'm not quite sure what the point of this novel is.

Its exquisitely observed details and unflinching analysis were gripping.  Her willingness to drop deep into her own grief and delineate its contours is courageous and inspiring.<br /><br />But as the book wore on -- and it is twice the length of the average memoir -- I found myself becoming disengaged.  The author's immense economic and cultural privilege, which she duly acknowledges, leads to occasional remarks that sat wrong with me.  The most striking example of this is when she writes that she and her husband not only paid a surrogate to carry a pregnancy, but also paid living expenses when one of the two people in the surrogacy family loses a job.  This comes after she and her husband had bought a house in the UK and paid for it for two years while still living and paying rent in Belgium, after a huge months-long remodeling project, after her husband got a year off work with pay when he moved from Belgium back to the UK, after a self-congratulatory description of how she and her husband decided to give away their excess wealth, after multiple rounds of IVF.  This lifted her experience far, far out of the realm of anything remotely connected to the ordinary, average woman, and this is the point where I began to feel that the memoir lost ground as some kind of attempt to speak for all women who have lost dearly wished for pregnancies and tried other arenas.<br /><br /> At one point she pretty explicitly questions whether the doctor who delivered her first stillborn, preterm baby deliberately killed it in some kind of internal wrenching movement.  This is a pretty gigantic statement, but she never follows up, either in terms of asking for an investigation or in writing about it.  It just lies there, a huge semi-indirect accusation.  I kept wondering whether the doctor could/would sue, whether the doctor had read a draft of the book and if so, what she had said.<br /><br />The lovely, delicate, sensory writing of the book's first half gradually felt as though it collapsed into a rushed chronicle of dates, events, persons in the last third in particular.

Wherefore art thou editor?<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've been this disappointed in a book. I wanted to love this book. I truly did. The All Souls Trilogy has so much potential, but, alas, readers are given a history lesson with a little storytelling thrown in. (And I use the term \"storytelling\" lightly).<br /><br />Let me just start with the things I enjoyed about the book, however few they may be.<br /><br />- I still like the idea of the plot. A powerful witch who doesn't know her own strength, a hidden manuscript that contains all manner of secrets about the creation of witches, vampires and daemons, and a bunch of crazies running around trying to prevent change and forbidden love.<br />- The rich history that Harkness portrays in her stories. She is a historian through and through, and it shows in her writing. If she would just tone it down a bit, I think it would appeal to a wider audience. She does a fantastic job of depicting the culture and architecture of Elizabethan England, and creates an outstanding visual for the reader.<br />- The last thing I liked about this book is the appearance of the fathers: Phillipe and Stephen Proctor. They were the only characters with any common sense, and were actually likable. Phillipe was the only thing that made the first part of the book bearable.<br /><br />And that's about it for the goods. I will try to keep the bad list as short as possible.<br /><br />- As I said, Harkness has the ability to portray a time and place of the past that only a true historian could do, but apparently it's assumed that readers have no imagination and must have EVERYTHING spelled out for us. There is way too much detailing that could have been edited out, and that is my major issue with this book. It's devoted, entirely, to miniscule details that in no way relate to the true plot of the story. The first half of the book consists of introducing you to the new surroundings and characters that put a damper on the story. There is no flow to it, and it drags on until well over halfway through the book.<br />- Character development is sketch in this second installment. There are so many contradictions to these characters, that by the end of this book I was done with all of them. Diana, who is supposed to be a student of alchemy, is still scared to death of her powers. Sigh. I'm sorry, but anyone who studies alchemy for a living would jump at the chance to have magic. She (supposedly) is an independent individual, but yet she relies on everyone else to do things for her and still has no desire to use her powers. Matthew is just a conundrum. He is controlling and possessive, yet somehow lets Diana romp all over England getting herself into trouble. (SPOILER) Not to mention that his best friend, Christopher Marlowe, is in love with him and therefore hates Diana, which leads to him spreading gossip, betraying Matthew, and ultimately trying to kill her. But get this! At the end of the story, Diana thinks it's best for them all to kiss and make up. Please. Where is crazy Matthew when you need him? That whole triangle of a relationship is too messed up for words. And I'm still not sure why Matthew didn't just kill him...<br />- The name dropping in this book is out of control. I'm still not sure how Shakespeare gave anything extra to this story. He is mentioned repeatedly yet we have no insight into his character. There are writers, alchemists, and royals thrown into the story at random, and it's just too much.<br />- (SPOILER) Lastly, and this is a completely personal opinion, I have some issues with one of the deeper subjects discussed in this book, which is Diana's miscarriage. After this happens, Matthew takes off with Marlowe every night getting drunk and high, but apparently this is okay, and Diana understands that he needs to act this way?? Umm... No, I'm pretty sure it is not okay. After this happened, I lost complete respect for Diana's character. No woman with any self-respect would make excuses for this type of behavior. Unfortunately, this is a normal way, for some people, to deal with grief, but it is not healthy and should not be brushed over with insignificance. It matters. This is not a light subject to throw into your story to create complications. Women deal with this issue all the time, and they should be empowered to stand up for their self and expect their partner to help them through the healing process. This act alone put into question exactly how genuine Matthew and Diana's relationship was. For me, everything else went downhill from there.<br /><br />Sadly, I don't think I even care at this point about reading the last book. I had issues with the first book but was hoping that the second would be a step up, and that just wasn't the case. If you are absolutely crazy about history and don't care about mindless prattle, then this may be the right fit for you, but don't expect a strong story line. Thoroughly disappointed with the direction this series took.", "images": [], "asin": "0143123629", "parent_asin": "0143123629", "user_id": "AFN6J6R5KKAK4BIYX2NSQMWCXG7Q", "timestamp": 1408459465000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

When connections to his family are made, the Detective unwittingly gets embroiled in a case involving a baby left in the woods.  As the investigation deepens, Jimmy clashes with almost everyone in his life, including his girlfriend Adele, his colleagues, his boss, and his daughter.  Convinced that a few seemingly unrelated cases are connected, Jimmy risks his career and personal relationships to make certain that justice is served.<br /><br />With important social issues such as illegal immigration, deportation, and exploitation of children, A Blossom of Bright Light highlights the plight of many undocumented individuals.  Except for the mystery surrounding the identity of the baby and mother, this book is strictly a crime novel.  There are really no surprises, as it was clear where the author wanted to take the plot.  With so many people connected to Vega involved, the story had a measure of unbelievability to it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not the book I anticipated", "text": "Let me just say that if this was a stand alone novel and not part of a series, I would have liked it. But the fact that it was a highly anticipated 3rd book of a series that I loved AND made movies I loved I was sooo disappointed with the storyline.  This was not the fun, ridiculous but still well written chic-lit that the other two books were.  Forgive me b/c there will be spoiler alerts as I vent.  Helen Fielding, why mess with a formula that worked by adding a dark somber element to it which is not how these characters were built up.  Not only did you kill off my favorite character but you made his children so young when he died that they have no memory of him.  So cruel.  Though in reality I would like to be supportive of a woman learning to move forward, when that woman is Bridget moving forward from Mark, I WANTED HER TO GRIEVE HIM UNTIL SHE DIED. He was the ONLY man for her and you can build up Mr. Wallacker as some super hero, but he is no Mark Darcy.<br /><br />The only thing consistent in what I liked about this novel compared to the first two is that my favorite scenes were still anything with a mention of Mark.  Even though I had to keep putting the book down because I was so freakin sad.<br /><br />Also, its pretty upsetting that after all this time her friends have no emotional maturity.  With the exception of Shazzar who has seemed to have grown up, the rest of them were pathetic at times. Jude was the worst. And Daniel being the kids Godfather...NO WAY WOULD MARK HAVE ALLOWED THAT, EVEN IF THEY MADE AMENDS BEFORE HE DIED.<br /><br />Sigh..I just hope they agree for a screenplay that is not reflective of the book and shows the happy and humorous ending we all wanted for Mark and Bridget (with an awesome fight scene between Mark and Daniel). Life does not always turn out the way you wanted, I get it...but that's not the lesson I want from Bridget Jones Diary.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Standard fare for the genre; Interesting lead character... but...", "text": "I read this book on the basis of a recommendation from one of my Amazon \"buddies\". I found it to be entertaining, with many overtones reminiscent of the works of Karin Slaughter: the Georgia setting, tough female protagonist, the nature of the crime. I think that if you like Slaughter's books you'll like this one.<br /><br />Overall, lead character Keye Street is interesting, well-developed and three-dimensional. An ex-alcoholic with a PhD, booted from the FBI for her drunken antics and now working as a PI.<br /><br />We're treated not only to her involvement in the investigation of a serial killer, but to some of her escapades as a PI and bail recovery agent. Some of these side trips were really interesting.<br /><br />The book moves along briskly and has plenty of action, as well as \"thriller\" overtones.<br /><br />But here's the one thing that kept popping up as a clinker repeatedly throughout the book: In author Williams's world, apparently the majority of people are either gay or bi-sexual. Or act like it, or are potentially so, or whatever.<br /><br />Now, I'd never heard of Williams before. As I've read some of the other reviews, I've learned that apparently she has a bibliography that was targeted towards a gay/lesbian audience, and published by a specialty house.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />But I gotta tell you, if I had to judge by this book, I'd have to guess that Atlanta must be the \"gayest\" city in the country. More than West Hollywood or Key West, apparently. It just got to the point that it was ridiculous. If she's going to write for the \"mainstream\", this is something she has to get away from. Yeah, there are gay people in all walks of life; and yeah, there are characters in mainstream novels who are gay, Milo Sturgis in the Alex Delaware novels coming immediately to mind; and yeah, they can be interesting and engaging characters. But books also have to reflect the reality of life, and the gay population is only about 2% in this country. That's about one in fifty, not the huge percentage we see in this book.

The problem goes back to Amazon.com, who sent me the wrong book.<br /><br />That said, much of my original review still holds, though I am raising my evaluation from three to four stars.<br /><br />This book has much to recommend it--especially for beginners in a classroom situation.  However, it has too many errors and omissions to be fully satisfactory for unassisted use by the beginners it targets.<br /><br />This is a tutorial, not a reference work.  That is, going page by page from the beginning to the end, one gets reasonably complete coverage of the main features of Wildfire.  However, many features and operations are omitted from discussion or covered only superficially.  This would not be a problem in a classroom situation, or if there were an experienced Pro/E user close by to answer questions.  But a student working on his own will often be left floundering.  It helps if one has recourse to the Pro/E Help Center, though that is unnecessarily difficult to find answers from.<br /><br />Given the nature of Pro/E and the editorial style of the book, it is not practical to use an edition of the book which is not specific to the particular release of Pro/E.  Among other things, PTC Corp is in the process of converting the Menu Manager with its submenus to dialog boxes, so that a student may be misdirected unless matching editions are used.<br /><br />This edition appears to have fewer errors than the previous one.  Still, Mr. Tickoo needs to submit his manuscripts for editing, both of grammar/punctuation and of technical directions, by persons competent in English and in the programs.  The language errors are aggravating but do not diminish the technical value of the book.  The technical errors and omissions are more serious.  The instructions are often incomplete or incorrect to the extent that the indicated operations cannot be completed based on the information given.  For example, on page 4-14, Figure 4-24, the student is instructed to select the Edge.  That doesn't work.  The correct instruction is the corner--the \"Vertex.\"  The discussion of the Datum System, perhaps the most difficult and most critical aspect for a working knowledge of Wildfire, is skimpy at best.  The examples and instructions given in the text only equip the student to stumble around looking for workable solutions.<br /><br />The tutorials are for the most part explicit and complete, though sometimes excessively redundant on common features and short on instructions for new or uncommon features.  The Exercises, at the end of the chapters after the Tutorials and Review Questions, often rely on operations which are not discussed until a later chapter.<br /><br />Neverthless, all things considered, I would judge this book as a qualified success--excellent for classroom use or under the tutelage of an experienced user, OK for a resourceful independent beginner willing to poke around for solutions when things don't work as expected.<br /><br />It should be noted that Mr. Tickoo has provided extensive material on his website supplementing this book.  However, those materials work only for the Student/Tryout version of Wildfire, not for the commercial release.  A person using the commercial release should obtain a tryout version (free for two months) if he wants take advantage of Mr. Tickoo's supplementary materials.", "images": [], "asin": "1932709037", "parent_asin": "1932709037", "user_id": "AFQQYQ5ZME4Z35VCPJYIOM4CABYQ", "timestamp": 1099421480000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Interesting", "text": "The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl scared me at first.  The two main characters are a couple of teenage misfits: one a computer nerd comic book geek boy, and the other a goth girl, and what more do I really need to say about that?  They both hate the world, and in the beginning it felt like this audiobook was headed down a very disturbing path, a Columbine-type situation at the least.  Let me ease your fears, nothing like that happens.  I'm willing to reveal that much because for a while I seriously considered dropping this book because of that.  The audiobook still has its disturbing aspects however.<br /><br />Fanboy lives with his mom and her new husband, \"the step-fascist\", who are expecting a baby soon, and his father has been growing more and more distant as the years pass.  Meanwhile, he has exactly one friend in the world, a friend who is becoming a popular athlete and will probably move on pretty soon.  Fanboy has developed the creepy habit of carrying a bullet in his pocket.  Whenever people start to bother him, he grasps it and it calms him, like a security blanket.  Goth Girl's mother died a few years back and she now lives alone with her father.  Since her mother's death, she just doesn't know how to cope with the world.<br /><br />Here are a couple of kids who desperately need someone.  The problem is that they both lost people they loved and trusted, and to avoid that hurt again, they push people away.  It's very sad seeing how these two react to their own personal traumas, and there are a couple of scenes in particular that are just heart-breaking.  Fanboy is excited about meeting his hero, comic book creator Brian Michael Bendis, at an upcoming convention, and showing Bendis the graphic novel he's been working on.  Fanboy gets nervous at the meeting and everything goes wrong, so Fanboy rushes into a restroom, looks in the mirror and shouts at himself, \"What did you do?  What did you do!\"  Later on, Fanboy and Goth Girl clearly like each other, but Kyra still fears being rejected.  She mentions Deena Jurgens, the most beautiful girl in school, and breaks down, crying, \"...because she's perfect, and I'm broken.\"  That's just sad.<br /><br />Who exactly is Fanboy?  I was about halfway through this audiobook when I realized that I didn't know Fanboy's real name.  The only reference I could remember was one time during his interior dialogue, he mentioned a time when his mom called him Donny, and how he hated it when she called him that.  After this realization, I started paying particular attention, waiting for someone to say his name, but it never happened.  It would always be something like, \"The teacher called out my name,\" or \"He asked me my name, and I said `as if'.\"  I have to assume that Barry Lyga deliberately avoided using Fanboy's name.  I guess that's to show us how the people at school didn't really see Fanboy as an actual person, and Fanboy always saw himself as less interesting and less important than everyone else.<br /><br />The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl was narrated by Scott Brick.  As I have mentioned before, I don't care for Brick's narrations.  He just doesn't sound natural to me, always either overly dramatic, or not dramatic enough.  When he reads dialogue, it doesn't sound like real people talking, it just sounds like Scott Brick reading a book.<br /><br />This wasn't a bad audiobook at all.  If I was to classify it, I guess I would call it a \"coming-of-age\" story.  Fanboy learns some important lessons about life and love, and you can sense him beginning to grow and mature.  With a different narrator, this audiobook probably could have been something special.", "images": [], "asin": "0739339044", "parent_asin": "0739339044", "user_id": "AGUZTAHWOMETRT2JTITUPJET2LQQ", "timestamp": 1371993267000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Are they trust worthy honest and kind? Are they competent, capable and skilled?<br /><br />Successful companies need to exhibit both qualities.<br />Too much of one attribute without the other is ineffective or detrimental.<br /><br />The authors use grids with emotional responses as illustration. `Each combined pattern of warmth and competence perception leads to a predictable set of emotional responses.'<br />High warmth and low competence makes us feel pity.<br />High warmth and high competence make us feel pride.<br />Low warmth and low competence makes us feel disgust.<br />Low warmth and high competence make us feel envy.<br /><br />Think of a cold, yet competent surgeon with no bedside manner or a kind-hearted yet bumbling neighbor who bakes cookies.<br /><br />The authors highlight the brand Lululemon as using the winning formula by of what they call the Principal of Worthy Intentions, `a customer relationship strategy that involves attracting and keeping customers by consistently putting their best interests ahead of those of the company or brand.'<br /><br />This was written before the recent debacle with Lululemon's recall of Yoga pants that customers complained about being too sheer, (made too cheaply) and CEO Chip Wilson's inadvertently insulting apology, a cringe worthy example of how to destroy customer perception of worthy intentions. According to the ideas presented here, Lululemon has most recently exhibited low warmth and low competence.<br /><br />The book presents a simple eye-opening concept that makes sense and is backed up by research.<br /><br />There's another book entitled Compelling People by John Neffinger and Matthew Kohut which offers similar ideas to The Human Brand. That book says we judge by our unconscious perception of a person's strength and warmth.<br /><br />The Human Brand is worth reading, but in light of what we know to be Emotional Intelligence, this book doesn't really break new ground.

Ambivalently recommended", "text": "Triss awakes from an accident not quite herself: her memories are fragmented, her appetite strange and insatiable, and she can't fit into her delicate place in her family's structure. Cuckoo Song has a meandering narrative structure reminiscent of Colin Meloy's Wildwood Chronicles, but, where Wildwood is whimsical, Cuckoo Song leans towards horror, especially in the first third. Triss's confusion and strangeness is deeply unsettling; as she gets answers, the tone lightens and the rambling adventure that follows is less compelling. But the thoughtful fantasy elements are pushed to their utmost, from Triss's captivating point of view to the satisfying resolution. Character growth is overly delineated (the perhaps inevitable drawback of middle grade), but sincere and rewarding. Hardinge has a lovely voice, analogy-heavy but also precise and evocative. I appreciate this novel more in pieces than as a whole--the promising intent is overwritten by transparent and rambling execution. But I would be happy to try another Hardinge novel in the future.", "images": [], "asin": "1419714805", "parent_asin": "1419714805", "user_id": "AFEURQMGWI3LXF5Y5SAFUT5CUMOA", "timestamp": 1458354843000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The book of the super-werewolf", "text": "\"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf\" is one of those rare books that truly and completely defies classifiation.<br /><br />Rather than a straightforward fiction or genre story, Victor Pelevin's symbolism-crammed book hops from one style to another -- Eastern mysticism, Russian urban fantasy, inhuman love story, wildly funny satire and postmodern exploration of Russia's place in a post-Soviet world. Despite the wealth of symbolism and a heavy dose of Buddhist philosophy woven in,, it's not stuffy or boring -- instead it's a wickedly funny personal journey that slowly slips into a bittersweet pathos as our shapechanging heroine learns some truths of the universe.<br /><br />A Hua-li is a werefox -- an ancient, genderless creature with a hypnotic tail, a currently obscene name, who feeds off the energy emanated by humans during sex. She's also a virgin, and is starting to get an \"old maid complex.\"<br /><br />And to stay energized, she works as a prostitute in Russia -- she doesn't have actual sex with her clients, but manipulates them with her tail. But after some disastrous encounters, she finds herself being investigated by the Russian authorities -- and particularly by the handsome Alexander, a werewolf who transforms and molests A Hua-li. She's shocked but captivated by the young werewolf, and soon they're in the middle of a passionate affair. Yeah, great message to be sending.<br /><br />The subject of the super-werewolf prophecy comes up when A Hua-Li's older sister and her flaky English aristocrat hubby come for a visit, with said hubby intent on becoming the super-werewolf himself. And A Hua-Li sees the werewolves being used to call oil from a dry well. But when a shocking change comes over her werewolf paramour, A Hua-Li must reexamine their relationship as she keeps her lover safe -- and reveal what the prophecy of the super-werewolf truly means.<br /><br />Buddhism, wereanimals, aristocrat/chicken-hunting, mass media, Rainbow Streams, Nabokov, DVD sex games and hypnotic tails who contain all the truth of the universe. Victor Pelevin has a knack for bizarre postmodern fiction that is rarely seen outside a Haruki Murakami book\"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf\" is like a brightly coloured mosaic of randomly sized and shaped pieces.<br /><br />Along that ride, we're privy to A Hua-Li's intricate meditations on everything from sex to watermelons -- often described in carefully numbered lists. Pelevin fills his meandering storyline with literary allusions (hello, Nabokov!) and infuses it with plenty of wry humour (\"We foxes are keen hunters of English aristocrats and chickens\"). There's even a hilarious scene where Alexander and A Hua-Li contemplate what DVD movies they should play out as their sex games (\"Listen, how old are you, twelve?\" \"Okay, let's forget the Matrix\").<br /><br />Yet he has a knack for hauntingly memorable scenes as well. Any creature as ancient as A Hua-li will have a sense of bittersweetness in their life, and her view of her lover's shocking transformation and his subsequent fear and confusion are striking. And as the book winds toward its esoteric end, Pelevin unrolls a heavy swathe of Buddhist philosophy that finally explains who/what the super-werewolf is, and what the prophecy means. Let's just say that it's not your average \"chosen savior of Group X\" prophecy.<br /><br />And modern Russia, as Pelevin paints it, is all grimy cold urbanity speckled with American products and foreign businessmen. He injects a lot of symbolism (Alexander, the oil well, the super-werewolf, the hypnotic tails that can reveal the true nature of things) as well as a mocking satirical edge (a doomed aristocrat's nonsensical ramblings about how HE can become the super-werewolf without any enlightenment).<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like? A Hua-li being raped by Alexander and immediately falling for him.<br /><br />But A Hua-Li is a pretty oxymoronic character -- she can be ruthless, manipulative, loving and sweet, has the enthusiasm of the young nymphet she pretends to be yet is ancient and experienced beyond even her own measure. And Alexander is her total opposite -- rough, brash, traditional yet modern, and possessing a straightforward mind that struggles with the more unusual spiritual paths of the \"super-werewolf.\" And then there's A Hua-Li's sister -- merciless and wickedly funny, especially since she marries British aristos in order to \"hunt\" them.<br /><br />\"The Sacred Book of the Werewolf\" is a bizarre crazy-quilt of genres -- a sort of symbolic Buddhist urban-fantasy satire, with a mingling of bittersweet and hilarious.", "images": [], "asin": "B003VYBECU", "parent_asin": "B003VYBECU", "user_id": "AHVIMKECEZDXXK5QIGX7KWJPN6DQ", "timestamp": 1294000590000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Every now and then I read one that I enjoy, and sometimes I read one that blows my mind.  However, most often I just don\u2019t love them.  I likely wouldn\u2019t have even had this one on my TBR list if it hadn\u2019t shown up on one of the book lists I follow.  This one was an add-on option for the Book of the Month Club\u2019s May 2022 box.  I didn\u2019t add it to the box, this isn\u2019t one I would want for my personal library, but I did add it to my TBR queue and grabbed it from my library (I love the library!  So many free books!).  I wasn\u2019t excited.<br /> This book has a setting I can identify, and the characters are actually people instead of some other entity with which I\u2019m unfamiliar.  Those two facts worked in its favor.  I dislike most fantasy because I don\u2019t want to have to visualize a completely different world and try to picture non-human entities.  I just want to dig into a story and lose myself.  While this book\u2019s format allowed me that privilege, I found myself struggling with the story.<br /> I became increasingly frustrated with back-and-forth timeline within Charlie\u2019s story.  I understand that Black needed to allow the reader to fully grasp Charlie and her background, I didn\u2019t like the way it played out.  It didn\u2019t seem to have a specific format, i.e.: one chapter now and one chapter then.  Black just sprinkled in Charlie\u2019s backstory whenever she felt like it.  I also felt like the story meandered.  There were minor storylines added in that seemed to have little purpose, despite being part of the bigger picture.  Then when the big picture was finally revealed, it felt very anticlimactic.<br /> And finally, I wanted more of Charlie\u2019s sister.  I can only assume that further volumes of this series will dive more deeply into her character, but until then I\u2019m just disappointed.  Posey comes across as an integral part of the book, but the part she plays really never does a lot\u2026she just exists.<br /> I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll read anything further in this series.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "\"Well, This Is Tense\" - a little uneven, but a very uniquely themed anthology", "text": "Crawling Back (by Allison Wall) - 3/5<br />Connections between parents and children. What would someone do in order to start over? How far back would you be willing to go?<br />This was a quietly creepy story. It becomes darker when you start to wonder just how many times the main character has 'gone back' to try and be better.<br /><br />Neon Monkey (by Oli Jacobs) - 5/5<br />A meaningless job. An endless and confusing set of routines. Waking up to strange situations over and over, each time where something doesn't quite make sense.<br />I love stories that manage to be unsettling. It's easy to scare a reader, but it's much harder to create a 'nightmare fuel' type of story.<br /><br />Now You See It Clear (by Mathew Gostelow) - 2/5<br />There's some beautiful and grotesque imagery here, but I just didn't connect with the whole 'addiction as a literal monster' analogy. If the source of the son's sickness was kept more ambiguous, it would have worked better.<br /><br />Rebirth (by Chrissie Rohrman) - 2/5<br />This story reminded me of Mike Flanagan's Oculus, where a mysterious mirror affects everyone around it. This story about an entity trapped behind a suburban woman's newly purchased mirror, felt similar. I thought this started off strong, but the ending was a little cliche. I also didn't like that this story didn't stick to the theme of the anthology, and was a mix of first and second person narration.<br /><br />The Sixth Floor (by Stephanie Kvellestad) - 5/5<br />Starting a new job can be stressful. People's names and faces to remember, layout of the new office,etc. A simple trip to the sixth floor of a new office building shouldn't be too hard of a task, right?<br />I loved how well the narrative showed the quiet desperation of the main character, who tries to remain calm and use logic despite things obviously being very very wrong around her.<br /><br />Electric Piano (by Lisha Goldberg) - 5/5<br />There was SO MUCH tension in this short little story! It takes real talent to make a piano performance feel so dramatic and full of action. Plus, I loved the little bits of dark humor sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />Mirror Image (by Priscilla Kint) - 3/5<br />A winding down party. A fellow party goer offering a ride back home. The driver keeps glancing back, but the main character can't quite see what it is.<br />This story builds up a sense of dread well, and I was hoping for a suitably creepy ending to match the mood set up in the beginning. Not going to spoil it, but the revelation and the end was too cliche for me.<br /><br />Hunger (by Shelby Catalano) - 2/5<br />It's a little hard to grasp what this was about. The prose had too much overwriting for me, and other than some darkly poetic imagery, nothing really happens in this. Hunger and internal emptiness are central themes, but there's no character growth/development, and that diminished some of the impact for me.<br /><br />Mother Of Worms (by Rae Knowles) - 2/5<br />A woman trapped in a locked shed by someone (a boyfriend, a husband?). She's unable to escape, she's growing hungry, and has resorted to trying to eat dirt.<br />Once again, the writing was a little clunky and I couldn't fully be immersed in the story. I give it points for some truly dark/poetic imagery, but the ending felt unsatisfying.<br /><br />Gryllidae (by Phil Ford) - 2/5<br />This begins with some promise, as the author builds a quickly growing sense of unease amid a seemingly idyllic life of an elderly couple. The story's main focus on grief and loss of a spouse held promise, but the ending with its dark figure in a cloak was too cliche for me.<br /><br />The Well (by N. Miller) - 3/5<br />A rumor of possible ghosts at a local well. One girl agrees to come along with her friend, even though she's uneasy. Something is off about the well, and about the way it reflects people.<br />This started off as a good urban legend-inspired story, but had a pretty weak ending.<br /><br />Love Bites (by Marissa Snyder) - 3/5<br />A happy bride, a charming wedding. Then, mysterious bites on her body start to appear. They keep coming back no matter what remedy is suggested. Nothing seems to work to make them go away.<br />This was written in a very lyrical, fairy tale-like way, and I loved it. I felt there was no real end though. At the most interesting and exciting part of the story, the narrative just abruptly ended. Ultimately not very satisfying.<br /><br />Each Minute Closer (by Brianne Battye) - 2/5<br />A set of routines in a person's life repeats. Each day it happens over and over again with no variation. Until the day that little glitches, little creepy changes start trickling in.<br />Once again, a story had a very strong start, and it made me want to keep reading. The ending could have been much stronger.<br /><br />Do Not Open Under Any Circumstances (by Tiffany Michelle Brown) - 3/5<br />A mysterious box is delivered to an office, seeming by no one. A warning is written on the box, never to open it. What will happen when the main character gives in to that sense of curiosity?<br />This had a good start and a terrifying moment (the whole bathroom encounter is amazing), but the ending was very typically cliche, with the whole message of 'one bad decision equals horrible torment for the protagonist'.<br /><br />Teeth (by Tanya Pell) - 5/5<br />A house with an unending amount of rooms. They seem to go on and on. Not enough windows or doors, so easy to get lost forever. A lost girl full of fear and nightmares tries to escape, but is lost in the maze of the house.<br />This read like a very dark fairytale, and I absolutely loved it. Ever think about those missing women from old fairy tales, those former wives of princes or kings? This story is like a glimpse of what happened to some of those women.<br /><br />Sinkhole (by Paul Lonardo) - 2/5<br />A man wakes up in what looks like a typical sinkhole. It should be relatively easy to climb out, and go back to his normal life. What if the sinkhole is something more, and he's very very far from home?<br />This was a boring story for me. There was an opportunity to better describe the strange landscape the man finds himself in, but it wasn't done. The story ended at a seemingly random point, and felt overall unsatisfying.<br /><br />Doppelganger (by Stuart Hardy) - 3/5<br />The most body horror like story of the collection so far! Starts off really good, and you're never 100% sure of what's happening to the main character. Is it all just a very intense heart attack, or the cause something more sinister? The ending is kind of a letdown, since it's cheesiness doesn't match the dark tone of most of the story.<br /><br />Itch (by Deborah Tapper) - 5/5<br />What starts off as a mere itch, turns into something more. Much,much more. This was an uncomfortable but amazing read. So many ways to interpret what was happening. Was it a delusion, or was the cause more grounded in reality? Ending is pretty dark, and the story ends strong.<br /><br />Seeds (by Dorian J. Sinnott) - 5/5<br />Set in a world where monsters are very much real, and what might pass of as superstition is very much a tool to ward off evil.  This felt like another dark fairy tale-inspired story, and I loved the strong familial bond between our main characters.<br /><br />Your Veins Full Of Water (by J.R. Santos) - 5/5<br />At the beginning, I thought this would be a story mostly focused on hauntings, but nope. This turned weird fast, and it was simply amazing. Without revealing too much, the scope is a little cosmic, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Conviction (by Justin Oldham) - 2/5<br />A prisoner goes through the motions of his day, knowing that his execution date is fast approaching. He reiterates and reassures himself that what he did was right and necessary.<br />This was so frustrating to read. Written well, but not a single bit of info is given about what the prisoner did. He says multiple times his convictions were true, but we never find out what they are.<br /><br />Cross Your Heart (by Die Booth) - 3/5<br />One fake online listing after another. Until something real comes up. A box that just might be really cursed.<br />This story ended too abruptly for me (probably could have used another page or so to develop more), but I'll give it points for surprising me at the end.<br /><br />Escape Path (by Rachel L. Tilley) - 2/5<br />Similar to the \"Conviction\" story a few pages back, this one's focus is also very narrow. It involves a woman trying to survive a treacherous trip in horrible weather. There are zero hents as to what she's trying to escape. I don't think that readers need to be spoon-fed explanations, but there's zero hints as to what's going on.<br /><br />You Want To Be Buried (by Taylor Grothe) - 5/5<br />A passionate dance at a party. A request made half-heartedly. What does it mean to not fully understand a promise?<br />This was such a darkly romantic and melancholy little story. I could tell the ending coming from the beginning, but it didn't matter since this was so well written. So good.<br /><br />We Are All Monsters To Our Mothers Someday (by Emmy Teague) - 2/5<br />The writing was fine, but I didn't connect with this story at all. Like the \"Now You See It Clear\" story earlier in the anthology, the metaphor used (grown up children seeming alien and incomprehensible to their parents) was clunky. If it was more subtle, I think the story would have been more scary/creepy/etc.<br /><br />Dreams Of Trees (by Patricia Miller) - 3/5<br />A man becomes newly rich due to an inheritance, and immediately starts thinking of how to use the family land to his financial advantage. He's so focused on progress and profit that he ignores the warnings given to him. Don't go into the woods, it is dangerous,etc,etc.<br />The main character was too much of a 'rich, spoiled guy' cliche to connect to. The ending has some good moments, but not enough to rate this higher.<br /><br />You Have No Internet At Home (by Zary Fekete) - 2/5<br />This starts off as a story of a man waiting to hear back (through e-mail) from his girlfriend. He has proposed to his girlfriend, but there hasn't been a reply from her for days.<br />Don't want to spoil this any further, but the story feels incomplete. The ending is abrupt, feels like it belongs from a different story. Not a satisfying read.<br /><br />Roxie and Ericka (by Ann Wuehler) - 2/5<br />This was written as a constantly shifting mix of first- and second-person narration. The structure of the story (a girl experiencing the drowning of her twin sister) was very jumbled as a result, and so confusing. It was lyrical at times and had some cool imagery, but overall was just muddled.<br /><br />Check This Out! (by Gully Novaro) - 5/5<br />What starts off as a camping story (making a fire, enduring goofy dad questions,etc), quickly goes very wrong. The creature in the woods that is after the main character (and her father) is truly unnerving. The mystery around it works to build up constant fear. I thought this would be a typical 'monster kills everyone in the woods' narrative, but...nope. This is strange, and sad, and very dark.<br /><br />Komodo My Desk (by bdyer) - 3/5<br />A graphic online video. A compulsion to watch it over and over again. Office politics, with its constant mix of personalities fighting each other. There's a little bit of the creepiness of the haunted video from the Ringu film franchise, but this is much more bizarre in tone. I honestly couldn't tell what was real or a hallucination of the main character (a typical office drone).

I was so excited when I saw a new one was out and couldn't wait to dive in.  Unfortunately I found the water to be more than a little murky and the swim, quite disappointing.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "This third edition is truly a rip-off!", "text": "OK, what have we got here?  To cover six years worth of Star Wars continuity since the last edition of the Guide, we get around 100 pages of new materiel.  Except it isn't new.  The author made a point to include materiel fom The Phantom Menace and Vector Prime, but other than that it seems nothing released in the last 2-3 years made it in here! No material from Allston's X-wing books, no Union, no prequel-era stuff except for the movie itself.  While there is a bit about Kyle Katarn from the Dark Forces game, nothing about his role in the sequel, Jedi KNight, which came out about four years ago.  There are virtually no new pictures, most of them are merely lifted from the Essential Guides.<br />But perhaps the biggest problem is in the organization.  Gone are the categorical indeces of aliens, droids, ships, planets, creatures, etc... which were so helpful at the beginning of Edition 2, gone is even a rudimentary timeline, absent is the galactic map which has been gracing most of the more recent Star Wars fiction. Also gone is the neat seperation in the earlier edition between &quot;canon&quot; materiel -- that established in the movies and their novelizations -- and just about everything else.<br />For about twice the price of this book you can get the Star Wars Encyclopedia, which has more materiel, many, many more color photos and illustrations, and better organization of materiel.

The Fifth Heart is a ponderous elephant that doesn't even try to pick up the pea in the corner, but just talks endlessly about it. Simmons sophomoric attempt at metafiction (Holmes suspects -- wait for it -- he is a fictional character) is nothing more than a silly thought experiment, resolved by the intervention of a profoundly fictional character from another undistinguished Simmons novel (But not until James and Sam Clemens discuss whether they too are merely fictional characters: Deeep, dude!). His infatuation with Henry James seems to mainly center on whether the novelist was gay; his interest in Holmes centers around an [invented] taste for heroin. We are treated at one point to a two-page description of dinner (the food, not the event) in which Simmons flaunts his research by putting cigarettes on the menu only to be crossed out as vulgar. We are given not one but two tours of the Columbia Exposition. Likewise two anecdotes are both told twice, each of them half a page and barely necessary to the plot. The entire book rants about &#34;anarchists,&#34; which is a code word in SImmonsspeak [See Black Hills] for socialists and the labor movement. But it turns out that anarchists (the point is not explicit) are not responsible for the nefarious plot after all. In the last fifty pages, Simmons finally realizes that he has to deliver something after dragging us through a 550-page Baedeker, so something actually happens -- something totally void of credibility. I'm sorry, but even SImmons' misogynist recreation of Irene Adler would not do what she does. Just no.<br /><br />Simmons seems to feel that any historical personage he can wedge into his novels should be smirched in the process. This teenage nastiness made reading Drood a exercise in masochism and left me wanting a brain rinse after Black Hills. I don't care if John Hay and Henry Adams cheated on their wives. I don't care if Teddie Roosevelt was a buffoon (who knew??). I don't care if Henry James liked to look at naked men. I don't care if Sam Clemens missed the Columbia Exposition because he had a cold.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Partnoy's still complaining", "text": "Frank Partnoy, author of this book and the very silly 'FIASCO: Blood in the Water on Wall Street', implies an illustrious career structuring and selling complex derivatives. In actual fact he worked on Wall Street for just two years in total, straight out of college. Instead of succeeding by staying the course, Partnoy made his millions by violating the Wall Street code of omerta and knocking out a sensationalist, mostly ignorant, account of the year or so he spent at Morgan Stanley. Infectious Greed is the follow-up, which purports to document the wreckage across the market since.<br /><br /> Having read FIASCO, which was valuable mostly for its unintended humour, I didn't expect much of Infectious Greed; I was rather looking forward to slating it, to be honest. It has the same air of maiden-aunt prurience as FIASCO but, almost despite himself, Partnoy's conclusions here aren't especially objectionable, and mostly undermine the tone of studied outrage he cultivates throughout the early part of the book.<br /><br /> The thesis of the book is that the financial markets have, of late, been corrupted by deceit and risk (hang on a minute: financial markets are *about* risk. Is it meaningful to say they can they be corrupted by it?). Yet at least half the book recounts events which took place ten or more years ago, in the primordial soup of the derivatives market. If a week is a long time in politics, a decade is an aeon on Wall Street: in 2004, the exploits of Bankers Trust and CS First Boston in 1993 aren't exactly current. The nascent derivatives market is now a mature trillion dollar industry. I dare say Professor Partnoy wouldn't recognise it.<br /><br /> Partnoy's explanations of the transactions are, however, lucid: so much so that they undo his conclusions. At one point he describes in two paragraphs the 'whipsaw' risk of an 'Inverse IO' instrument. It's a very clear explanation, which completely undermines his concluding observation that 'it was unclear whether any mutual-fund mangers [the investors] understood all of this'. Here's the thing: to put not too fine a point on it, a professional fund manager who doesn't understand what can be lucidly explained in eight sentences, yet still invests in it, should be shot. So should his employer. And neither deserves the respect (for which, read, money) of the public. It might seem a harsh lesson, but it wouldn't take too many collapses to shake the mums and dads in Ohio out of their complacent stupor and shift their funds to a manager who was prepared to employ qualified managers and supervise them properly. The market has a way of teaching people valuable lessons that market regulation and government bail-outs really don't.<br /><br /> The funny thing is, Partnoy does continually stumble over this axiom, but doesn't recognise it. He quotes a Peat Marwick partner who derides ignorant fund managers thus: 'if you don't understand, you might as well place it all on red at Atlantic City or Las Vegas, because at least there you get free drinks.' Though Partnoy doesn't think so, the analogy is a good one: the very monied nature of Wall Street is the most graphic illustration of the fact that, unless you really know your onions, you are NOT going to end up a winner. The house is; which is why most of them can afford to pay their 20,000+ employees salaries which average out at half a million dollars each (it's all in the annual report - do the sums!). Like Casinos, Wall Street trading desks have a motive ulterior to realising some poor schmuck's American dream: the object is to make, not lose, money, and this is exactly what they do and a statistically constant basis.<br /><br /> Partnoy repeatedly calls for regulation of the derivatives market without ever making a case for how this might be done or how it would prevent the losses he documents in the book: criminal statutes don't stop people committing murder, after all. All the regulation in the world won't stop fraudsters (if they're committing fraud, then by definition the regulations are already there, and they're breaking them). On the other hand, exploring the idiosyncrasies of rules *without* breaking them is the prerogative of every citizen, not just Wall Street banks. After all, regulatory arbitrage is only possible because of prescribed regulatory rules tend not to precisely reflect economic reality. If rules have irrational boundaries, then it is economically rational to exploit them.<br /><br /> Eventually, Partnoy acknowledges this. He cannot ultimately muster much venom for the perpetrators of the Enron debacle, and by the epilogue, where he sets out his recommendations (full marks to him for putting his money where is mouth is, by the way: it's one thing to criticise; quite another to suggest a solution) his proposals don't include regulation of the wholesale derivatives market (&quot;some derivatives markets might appropriately have been left unregulated&quot; he concedes) but simply equivalent accounting treatment with comparable financial instruments, and most of his fire is reserved not for Wall Street traders or greedy executives, but the credit rating agencies which operate under the umbrella of a government-sponsored oligopoly (only Moody's, Fitch and S&P are recognised for regulatory purposes). And you'll never guess what his solution is for dealing with the rating agencies: Without a hint of irony, he suggests they be deregulated!<br /><br /> By the final sentence of the book, it seems the most elementary elements of market theory may have finally slipped through: Partnoy asks his readers whether they have taken any prudent steps to properly evaluate their investments before putting up any money: 'If you answered 'no,' you have one more person to blame in addition to the accountants, bankers, lawyers, credit raters, corporate executives, directors and regulators who failed to spot the various financial schemes of recent years.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Did Not Meet Expectations", "text": "The Good Girl by Mary Kubica was one of those books that I have been looking forward to reading, believing that it\u2019ll be a great read especially from all the positive reviews I\u2019ve seen and heard. Unfortunately, the book didn\u2019t live up to the anticipation and expectation that I have been carrying around.<br /><br />While the book had a good concept and merit, the majority of my issues was mostly on the execution of the story. First, the writing was just average. I thought there were instances in which scenes and actions could\u2019ve been manipulated in such a way that it wouldn\u2019t have taken as long as it did to get to the point. As a result, the story had this slow pace that took the energy away from the story which in turn took away my energy in reading it. I wasn\u2019t exactly eager to get back to the book, even though I was close to finishing it. If the book isn\u2019t evoking a sense of excitement or eagerness in the reader, it would be difficult for said reader to reciprocate it in reading it.<br /><br />Second, I couldn\u2019t muster any kind of emotional attachment/reaction, positive or otherwise, to the characters. In a remote way, I know what I\u2019m supposed to be feeling but I just didn\u2019t feel it. I just felt the portrayal of the characters were stuck to the surface, never going any deeper or giving something new. Considering how the book was advertised, I was expecting something deeper and more complex than what I got.<br /><br />Finally, my biggest issue: the different viewpoints. I didn\u2019t have problems following the story through the switching of POV\u2019s. What my issue was the way Kubica used it. I thought the book could\u2019ve been better if she narrowed the number of POV\u2019s and assigning a particular character/POV with either the past or the present. If there wasn\u2019t a lot of switching of POV\u2019s and time flipping, it would\u2019ve made the story move at a faster pace and more efficient in its storytelling. As it was, it created a sort of discombobulated story flow to compound the issue of the story\u2019s pace.<br /><br />This book was one of those that I would include with the others who didn\u2019t meet my expectations. Perhaps that is my fault, I should know better than to have such thoughts going into a book. But I did and unfortunately, it fell a little short. The core of the story had potential and there were moments that captured my attention, but the execution wasn\u2019t able to keep it for long.", "images": [], "asin": "B00IB5BSBG", "parent_asin": "B00IB5BSBG", "user_id": "AHK4SVWZNWTMAQN3LKJOW7T2XJZA", "timestamp": 1439402407000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "3 Stars for Glitch By: Heather Anastasiu", "text": "Glitch by author Heather Anastasiu is the first installment in the trilogy bearing the same name.<br /><br />The people, (if you can still call them that) live underground in a suppressed and highly controlled society. Everything is regulated and there are no emotions. Everyone is \"Linked\" into a network from the beginning where everyone is stripped free from their humanity. They are 100% controlled, from where they live, who they marry and have kids with, to what they eat. It's a sad, sad life to be forced into. But what if that's the life that was chosen by the people who came before you? And what if there was a chance you could break free? What if it's a malfunction, or as they call them \"Glitch\" that makes you an anomaly?<br /><br />These are the questions few people have to face in this world. It's scary to be an anomaly when everyone is programmed to report you. Zoe is terrified when she starts to glitch. I couldn't even imagine being a teen and having that huge flood of emotions come rushing at you. Things you have no idea what they are, or why you are feeling the way that you do. And then on top of it to also find out you have an even bigger secret you don't want getting out... It would be such a whirlwind to me; I wouldn't know how to react.<br /><br />So, first things first... I'd like to say that I've been DYING to read this book for months now. The whole idea about people living this way, people that are more or less cyborgs, which they are never called by the way. I just had to know more. I liked the story, felt eh about the characters, but I could see such potential, more at the end of the book with the twists and turns than my initial reaction at the beginning.<br /><br />I felt the characters were a bit off. Yet, while I was reading I had to remind myself that while they were teens, they were teens who had never felt any types of emotions before. In a sense they were younger in age emotionally then they appeared physically. They were pretty juvenile to say the least. Even Adrien was odd. He felt so much older and wiser then his teen years too. It was such a stark contrast that made me have to remind myself that they both came from such different places and was raised so differently that they would be like night and day. Yet, it just didn't feel right.<br /><br />The whole insta-love didn't work for me at all. For Zoe, just learning what all these emotions she's feeling are, I can't see anyone in her position just jumping straight into falling in love with someone. I thought of her being more cautious as she was with Max.<br /><br />Speaking of Max, he creeped me out! Did anyone else feel this way about him?<br /><br />The writing was okay. Again, I felt that the best part was the last quarter of the book. I liked the twists and turns and felt that those were key points in the story for me. I liked the twist with Molla as well and I'm eager to see how her story line plays out. I just hope that Anastasiu gives us more of her in the next installment.<br /><br />All in all, I found things that were okay and while I could see reasons for things happening throughout the story and the characters, I was left a little flat while reading. It just didn't blow me away as I was thinking it would. I am glad that I did read it for that last part of the book, which has made me eager to read the next one to see what happens further on into the story, which is important when reading a beginning of a trilogy.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not happy with this book at all", "text": "So...to say I am disappointed with this book is a vast understatement, to say the least.<br /><br />*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!! ***<br /><br />First and foremost, this story line seems to be plucked from her rear end. Whether she intended all along to add something like this to the Green Rider series, or if it was some misguided whim, will remain a mystery. However, I think it was a mistake on her part because, as for myself, it detracted from the overall series and the type of world that had been so meticulously built over the first 4 books.<br /><br />I do not care that Karigan was propelled into the future, for as we've read in the other books, she has occasionally traversed through layers of time. But to base 90% of the book in a futuristic, steampunk world, with none of the previous characters we've come to know and love in sight was idiotic. Pretty much, this book almost could have been a stand alone unrelated to the Green Rider series other than a few touches here and there.<br /><br />Yes, we get glimpses into the &#34;present&#34; time, the time Karigan lived in, as to keep slightly, though barely, updated on what's going on in our beloved Green Rider world.<br /><br />Many characters, as well, seemed half baked. And when I say many, I mean most. The professor, though more thought out, was essentially only good for a place to stay. He was rarely around, and then only when he served the purpose of introducing Karigan to other characters. Miriam, Lorine, Luke, Silk, even Arhys, were there just to have regular interactions. With the exception of Silk, none truly led to moving the story along, and even Silk very little. Lhean was even pointless. Why bring him into the future with her? He didn't have any significant part until the end, which even then was minimal in only helping Karigan with the riddle and to light the moonstones.<br /><br />Amberhill...dear gods, what can I say. He is not even actively in the story until the very, very end and, yet again, not enough to notice. In previous books, seeing as how Amberhill was mostly pointless in regards to the story as a whole, I was curious to see what her motivations were to keeping him in the series at all. Though I never had a particular aversion to Amberhill before, I have to say I'm extremely disappointed if this is what she had in mind all along. I know the following books will most likely fill in the gaps as to what happened to Amberhill between the past and the future, but Mornhaven has been the primary evil in the whole series. Yes, I know he resides in Amberhill, but even that seemed half baked. Oh yes, we'll just keep Mornhaven in the story somewhere, just so no one will gripe about this book being such a stretch from the others. For the big, bad villain to change so suddenly didn't help the overall underwhelming story line for this book.<br /><br />Now on to Cade. Though a generally likable character, seemingly more thought out than the rest, was a stretch for me as well. It mostly seemed he was put there simply to take attention away from the Zachary/Karigan romance that had been building in the previous books. Why? After all this time, why would you try to weaken that relationship? I'm not even one of those girls that need some sort of romantic relationship to exist in a book to enjoy it. But in this series, after all the hardships and loss Karigan has faced, as well as more to look forward to in the future, the little kernel of light at the end of the tunnel for readers was her and King Zachary. That somehow, against all odds, she would get to be happy, as well as Zachary, in return for all the darkness that was endured. But, from things I've picked up on at the end of this book, I don't have high hopes at all of there being a future relationship of any kind with King Zachary. It has been suddenly, and brutally, cut off with no apparent reason.<br /><br />And, something that pisses me off in any book because it is utterly unrealistic and believable, is when the heroine falls madly in love with a guy in 2.5 days! Which is generally what happened with Cade. After only a few weeks of knowing one another, they fall in love, have sex, and would have possibly produced a child had she stayed. For a girl who had never previously displayed such idiotic, girly characteristics before, and who had been madly, unyieldingly in love with Zachary, she did a complete 180! It further ruined my enjoyment of the book, as well as any hope of redemption for future books.<br /><br />Karigan also pissed me off. What happened to the stubborn, strong willed girl with tons of fight in her? Oh sure, on occasion those attributes would show themselves, but almost more as an afterthought from the author, who seemed more determined to turn her into a pathetic, weak, helpless damsel in distress. And she was so blatantly stupid at times, it hurt to read. Apparently wit and intelligence, determination and cunning, were also scrapped along with other personality traits when writing this book.<br /><br />It's not as if Mrs. Britain is known for her speedy book releases, and I would have gladly waited for *additional* years to get a book that actually held anything I loved from the previous books, something that actually made more sense to the series.<br /><br />In general, the writing is not bad, and is as well written as her others on a basic level. Had this been an unrelated stand alone, I probably could have enjoyed it more. But as for its relevance to the Green Rider series....alas I feel I wasted years much anticipating this book just to be b*tch slapped by the author instead.<br /><br />I will stick with the series, but after this book, I have to say I am more likely to dread the release of the 6th book instead of anticipating it... :-(", "images": [], "asin": "B00FX7RFL2", "parent_asin": "B00FX7RFL2", "user_id": "AHLNAPY5GM2B2BIAEZXXGVPBQ3KQ", "timestamp": 1415992368000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

While some historical background is useful, the return to Ackley again and again was annoying, since the author was obviously copying material published elsewhere.  The fact that he didn't even try to make a mount seems hypocritical and his demeaning rationale doesn't ring true.  I most enjoyed the discussions of novelty taxidermy and the preservation of pets.  These areas would seem the best material to use in considering the psychology of people who desire such bizarre creations.
