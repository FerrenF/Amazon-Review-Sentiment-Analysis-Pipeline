{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Picture Your Dead", "text": "What I liked best about this book was the scrapbook pages before and after each chapter.  Pictures, letters and little mementos were drawn by the illustrator (Lisa Brown) to accompany Jennie's memories and stories.  The process of taking pictures of the dead wasn't unknown to me before now; there were several such pictures at family member's old house and though its creepy it was highly fascinating at the same time.<br /><br />What didn't work as well for me was Jennie's narration.  I'm not entirely certain why, just that no matter how interested I became in the story Jennie would draw me out of it almost immediately.  She had a very formal sound to her voice, not stiff exactly, but as if sharing the story wasn't the first thing she wanted to do.<br /><br />I know very little about Civil War America, as far as the culture and what happened outside of the battles is concerned.  It was fascinating to read about Jennie's family and in hindsight what she couldn't see about her Aunt and Uncle, or even her cousins, she observes and discounts.  She observed her cousin Quinn's odd behavior from the first, but chose to discount it.  She was so worried about not being tossed out (now that her fiancee was gone) she didn't want to see I think.<br /><br />The ending is darkly hilarious--secrets are laid out and Jennie finally gets back her own.  I was kind of disappointed, only because the epilogue made her exit feel less climatic.  I think this will appeal to fans of history (this is chocked full of historical tidbits) or of suspense/mysteries honestly.

The other reviewers have detailed the plot.  This book didn't make sense to me. Why would the villian, Rob, after just being released from prison put himself in the position to land back in prison?  He was aware of the other murder he committed.  It seems to me he would have tried to live his life as quietly as possible.  The premise is he wanted a new trial, even though he served all his required time, to clear his name.  Clearing his name was important to him because it would allow him to be reinstated in his wealthy grandmother's will.  Great, but Rob WAS guilty of this  murder as well as another murder that he was never even suspected of.  Ellie, the heroine, became obsessed with PROVING his guilt only after Rob announced his desire for a new trial.  Ellie's probing into Rob's background opened a can of worms.  She discovered he committed another similar murder as well as attempted murder.  Rob's purpose for wanting a new trial was to receive a $100.000 inheritance from his grandmother.  He was already wealthy.  His parents were wealthy.  He risked his guilty neck for another $100,000.  It doesn't make sense.  He had much more to lose than to gain.  I didn't like Ellie.  She was very closed minded. Unfortunately, since the entire book was written from her perspective I couldn't like the book because I didn't like her.  Finally, there was no suspense.  You know early on Rob killed her sister.  The rest of the book is Ellie digging up ever rotten thing Rob did as a teenager.  The climax was a dud. Rob could have succeeded in hitting Ellie over the head with the tire iron and I could have cared less.  Mary Higgins Clark has written some superior suspense novels.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The birth of psychohistory dawns", "text": "&quot;Why, he wondered, did so many people spend their lives not trying to find answers to questions\u2014not even thinking of questions to begin with? Was there anything more exciting in life than seeking answers?&quot;<br /><br />After five novels spanning as many centuries, one might have supposed Asimov's stepwise tinkering with his Foundation universe had come to an end. The adventures of Golan Trevize, Janov Pelorat, and Bliss concluded in Foundation and Earth (1983), with a finale as intellectually rewarding as it was thematically resonant. Trevize gained the validation he desired for choosing Gaia (or proto-Galaxia) over the Seldon Plan. But just five short years later, again at the behest of avid fans and pushy publishers, Asimov picked up the series once more, this time in the form of a prequel. As its name suggests, Prelude to Foundation (1986) was the first of two prequels setting up the events of the original Foundation novel released in 1951.<br /><br />For most of the series, psychohistory's founder, Hari Seldon, is this enigmatic figure spoken of only in cryptic, quasi-spiritual terms, rather like a demigod. Little is known about the man other than that he was a mathematical genius whose equations helped shepherd humanity through a series of increasingly existential crises. In Prelude Seldon's saintly aura is stripped away as we are introduced to the young, martial arts-trained professor laboring to turn his coveted psychohistory into a practical, applied science.<br /><br />The first act opens on the planet Trantor, the Empire's capital, as Dr. Seldon presents his seminal paper at the Decennial Mathematics Convention. In a decision he soon comes to regret, he lays out a theoretical method by which the future can be determined probabilistically. The key word here is 'theoretical', a detail those with a hankering for control over the world order seem uniformly disposed to overlook. In Seldon's own words:<br /><br />&quot;And I went on to show that this would result in the ability to predict future events in a statistical fashion\u2014that is, by stating the probability for alternate sets of events, rather than flatly predicting that one set will take place.&quot;<br /><br />News of his work spreads like a thunderbolt. Emperor Cleon I himself arranges a meeting, in the hope that he can use Seldon's abilities as a means toward self-preservation. Haunted by the specter of assassination, Cleon is dismayed upon learning that psychohistory is not yet ready for primetime. He's not about to risk it falling into the hands of his enemies, however, and orders his right-hand man, First Minister Eto Demerzel, to keep close tabs on Seldon's progress. Demerzel is a shadowy character whose influence penetrates each of the disparate sectors on Trantor. Seldon now has a target on his back. Indeed, it seems he is now the most important person in all of the Galaxy, with the powers that be all wishing to profit from a mature psychohistory.<br /><br />Before Seldon can return to his home world of Helicon, he runs into one Chetter Hummin, an intrepid journalist who warns Seldon of the Emperor's intentions. Like Cleon, Hummin also seeks a functional psychohistory. His aims prove more noble than the former's, as he anticipates it being used to divert the Empire from its path of rotting decay. Seldon, meanwhile, harbors strong doubts that his mathematics actually possess the potential his benefactors so eagerly seek, but Hummin is able to convince him that his research will be for the good of humanity. After dispatching a couple of the Emperor's goons, they flee to a nearby university in Streeling Sector, where Seldon can tend to his work in relative safety.<br /><br />There he meets Dors Venabili, a historian and the second protagonist in this outing. She agrees to watch over Seldon and assist him with his studies. Dors' larger role in the narrative is shrouded in mystery and isn't fully explored until the second prequel. In this outing she serves as an eloquent sounding board for Seldon's frequent riffs and ruminations, while her strong-willed and circumspect presence nicely balance her counterpart's impetuosity and fitful naivete over the course of their journeys. Thankfully for Seldon, she is also quite capable of kicking ass when only violent options present themselves.<br /><br />Seldon's stint at the university is short-lived, as he is unable to escape the feeling that his every move is being watched by the Emperor and his minions. Following a close encounter in which Seldon's reckless actions nearly get him killed, Hummin relocates Seldon and Dors to Mycogen Sector, an underground society on Trantor proper that is believed to possess some of the oldest records in the Galaxy. It is thought that by simulating an earlier period of history where the moving parts were decidedly smaller in both scale and in number, this will greatly simplify Seldon's intractable task of mathematizing human societies.<br /><br />It wouldn't be an Asimov novel without heaping sexism, and Mycogen serves it in spades. As thoroughly patriarchal as it is puritanical, Mycogen is a world in which the subservience of women has been raised to an organizing principle. In public, men speak only to men; women are never to address men, much less outsiders like Hari and Dors, outside the privacy of their own home. Seldon exploits the situation, manipulating one of the women to obtain their sacred book, hoping it may hold the clues he needs to perfect his theory. The book appears to be a dead-end, but it does lead Seldon to believe that the Mycogenians are protecting one big secret: a 20,000 year-old robot holed up in their Sacratorium\u2014a museum-cum-temple of sorts dedicated to remembering their past glory on the home world Aurora.<br /><br />The site is off-limits to off-worlders, so Seldon and Dors don disguises and sneak inside. They do in fact find a robot, albeit defunct. In the process they are &quot;caught&quot; by one of the High Elders, an artificer whose machinations had lured the duo into a trap; rather than Seldon doing the manipulating, it was he who was beguiled into following a course of action pursuant to Mycogenian interests. The Elder had been in communication with the Emperor, and sought to strike a deal in turning Seldon over to Imperial authorities for his sacrilegious breach of custom. Seemingly always in the right place at the right time, Hummin intervenes by playing up psychohistory's potential for furthering Mycogen's interests. The Elder reluctantly agrees to forget the whole ordeal, reneges on his arrangement with the Emperor, and allows the trio to depart Mycogen for good. (Hmm...)<br /><br />Hummin shuttles them off to another of Trantor's sectors known as Dahl. Not only is their purpose for going here unexplained, their stay in Dahl is one of the weaker sections of the book. Were it not for introducing important characters who play a larger role in the sequel, there would be little to recommend its place in the story. Seldon meets a precocious factory worker named Yugo Amaryl whom he promises a job after seeing some scribbled equations Amaryl had been working on in his spare time. Amaryl also mentions a wise woman known as Mother Rittah who holds ancient knowledge about Earth\u2014the original home of humanity and, Seldon hopes, an ideal case study for psychohistory.<br /><br />Seldon and Dors venture into the slummy Billibotton District in search of Rittah, where they are set upon by a swarm of knife-wielding miscreants. Dors makes quick work of them, an experienced knife-fighter herself. Shortly thereafter they befriend a homeless, alley-smart twelve year-old named Raych who leads them to the oracle. She reveals to them that the Mycogenians' lost world Aurora was actually the robot world that destroyed Earth (cue the Robot series!).<br /><br />Dahl authorities catch wind of their antics and send a pair of constables to question them. Threatened with arrest, Seldon and Dors knock out the officers, putting our heroes permanently on the run. Fortunately, Raych leads them to safety, when a mysterious soldier shows up on orders to escort Seldon away from Dahl. Raych, Dors and Seldon all end up in Wye\u2014a sector at Trantor's south pole\u2014whose mayor (Rashelle) has been biding her time as she plots the usurpation of Emperor Cleon's throne. Rashelle's plan would allow her to gain full control of Trantor and its various sectors while relinquishing all Imperial command of the isolate planets. Seldon, she believes, is the ace in the hole required to carry out her grand act of sedition.<br /><br />Seldon wants no part in this scheme, and for good reason: he now knows how to make psychohistory practical. Through his diverse cultural experiences in each of the sectors spread across Trantor, he realizes Trantor itself will serve as the perfect model for developing his inchoate science, which can then be generalized to the rest of the twenty-five million worlds populating the Galaxy. At least, that's the idea. But if Rashelle's coup comes to fruition, the Galaxy would be plunged into anarchy, menaced by a neverending series of territorial disputes and sanguinary transfers of power. If Seldon is to mature his science and stave off the destruction to come, the Empire must remain at peace.<br /><br />As if on cue, Rashelle's plot is foiled as the soldiers under her command no longer assent to her orders. Hummin arrives on the scene and the remaining pieces fall into place. We learn that Hummin is none other than...Cleon's confidant and advisor Eto Demerzel. Moreover, he's not actually a human at all, but the legendary robot named R. Daneel Olivaw, whom Trevize and crew meet in the conclusion to Foundation and Earth. Further still, Hummin / Demerzel / Olivaw possesses mentalic powers (\u00e0 la the Mule) enabling him to subtly manipulate the emotions of others. This explains Seldon's drive to perfect psychohistory despite his earlier skepticism, the High Elder's leniency on Mycogen, and Rashelle's failed scheme, among other improbable feats of chance.<br /><br />Having lived the last 20,000 years, Demerzel sees the approaching collapse of the Empire as inevitable and psychohistory as the mechanism by which to minimize the fallout. Thus, in accordance with the Zeroth Law\u2014&quot;A robot may not harm humanity, or through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm&quot;\u2014he intervenes just enough to nudge events in Seldon's favor.<br /><br />Prequel Fever<br /><br />Critics have been somewhat harsh on this entry, and not without reason, the most fundamental perhaps being that Seldon's quest for a workable psychohistory just isn't all that compelling. What made the earlier novels so memorable was exploring the limits of psychohistory and seeing whether the next great challenge was acidic enough to dissolve the Seldon Plan. The cerebral acrobatics of navigating the contours of each successive crisis as the Galaxy tests its fate against the provisions of ancient prophecies forms the bread and butter of the Foundation series. Sure, Prelude contains all the twists and bombshell reveals characteristic of Asimovian fiction, but the humble beginnings of Seldon's Big Idea fail to reach the epic heights imparted by the settings that have so endeared generations of readers.<br /><br />Delving too much into origins also comes at a cost. There's a certain mystique surrounding psychohistory\u2014one of the most inventive and successful concepts in all of science fiction\u2014that isn't helped by reductive exposition. By cutting the enormity of psychohistory down to size, some of the series' allure invariably wisps away. More problematic is the lackluster execution of the reveal. There is no single ground-shaking discovery or torrent of insight that sets Seldon on the right path, no &quot;Eureka!&quot; moments that lead him to his statistical laws. He just wakes up one morning and says he's worked it out. (No, literally that's what happens.) We're supposed to believe his traipsing around Trantor set him on the right course to a solution. That's at best unsatisfying, even if it's naive to expect juicy insights into what are ultimately fictional concepts with little chance of being mapped onto reality. But as plot devices go, it's pretty tame.<br /><br />What's more, the places they visit fail to inspire and feel thrown in merely to bridge Asimov's various fictional projects. A lot of space in this book is tied up in external references to the Robot and Empire series\u2014in asides that aren't particularly purposeful in and of themselves. The robot subplot on Mycogen and the preoccupation with the Aurora-Earth connection, for example, make for interesting sync points with the Asimov corpus, but don't do much heavy lifting in progressing the central plot of Prelude. Asimov notes in the introduction that unification was not what he had in mind when these stories were conceived, and devoted greater effort to the task later in his career. It certainly shows, but surely it's not worth the confusion readers unfamiliar with his other stories are sure to experience.<br /><br />As for plot holes, there might be one relating to Olivaw. He has supposedly functioned as Demerzel, counselor to the Imperial throne, for decades, and is frequently referred to as the most influential person in the Galaxy, even more so than Cleon himself. He has connections with sectors all across Trantor. Yet no one knows what he looks like, or that Hummin and Demerzel are the same person? Or, rather, is it that Olivaw lulls them into forgetfulness? With the mind control mechanic, one can never be sure. (I had the same issue with Jessica Jones, alas.)<br /><br />There is also the obligatory caveat about character development. As we've come to accept from this series (and from Asimov in general), the individuals on the page serve largely as mouthpieces for Asimov's ever active, idea-saturated mind. What 'development' we do get is intellectual in nature, as Seldon puzzles out solutions to psychohistory. Where such shortcomings might be given a pass in earlier novels, overshadowed as they were by the larger arc built into the narrative, they're more visible wrapped inside a more confined and chronologically compact story.<br /><br />What is unique about Prelude, however slight a difference it makes in the end, is that Hari Seldon is widely thought to be modeled after Asimov himself. Ruthlessly logical, chronically inquisitive and never satisfied he has the final answer in hand, Seldon is the hardened intellectual Asimov embodied throughout his illustrious career. The recurring problem, however\u2014and Prelude once again fails to break the mold\u2014is the supporting cast, who is every bit as effortlessly logical and thorough as Seldon. Each of the characters he interacts with, even the oppressed women on Mycogen, go toe to toe with Seldon's brilliance. They speak the same way, they reason the same way. The criticisms of previous entries thus still stand: the dialogue reads largely as an exchange between scholars than as variegated, down-to-earth human beings with diverse flaws and personalities and cognitive talents to boot. It's all the more ironic given that social complexity is presented as the critical plot device underwriting psychohistory's evolution from concept to reality.<br /><br />The Alignment Problem<br /><br />What if robots get there first? One point raised by Dors is the implications of reducing human behavior to mathematical laws. \u201cHow horrible,&quot; said Dors. \u201cYou are picturing human beings as simple mechanical devices. Press this button and you will get that twitch.\u201d Seldon's attempt to bring quadrillions of people under computational control puts Dors ill at ease despite the benevolent impulse behind it. But should this give us pause as well? After all, whether we will be able to model our actions to this extent is irrelevant, because our future AI companions most certainly will.<br /><br />And this dovetails directly with the alignment problem in AI\u2014the notion that the goals of superintelligent AI may ultimately prove inconsistent with human well-being or the preservation of our species. Any dynamic, self-modifying superintelligence will eventually understand human behavior at the level of the brain. At that point, their intelligence and capabilities will have far surpassed our own and we may come to be viewed as lesser beings, of trivial consequence to the universe. The fundamental worry is that sufficiently advanced AI will graduate from mechanical servants to omniscient overlords and treat us the way we treat cattle or insects. Perhaps then we would need something like an AI Mule on our side to out-manipulate rogue AI. The future of AI systems will be nothing if not interesting.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br /><br />Prelude to Foundation is the story of how psychohistory was born. We learn more about the Delphic Hari Seldon (who knew he could hold it down in a fight?) and how he managed to see the future in terms of probabilities. Through expository jaunts on Trantor, he meets a range of characters who cause him to see his project in a different light and who will play pivotal roles in the events to come. Many interactions seem to exist for the sole purpose of tying in his Robot and Empire series. While some may find these tangents distracting, they do add more texture to Asimov's voluminous universe and neither substantially improve nor detract from Seldon's odyssey. I enjoyed the intellectual jawing that permeates all of the Foundation novels, even if Prelude's lesser scope made me nostalgic for the high-stakes, space-traversing amplitude of the earlier works. Whether we ultimately needed an origin story is left for the reader to decide. As for myself, it's the stories that emerge once Seldon's science is already off the ground that keep me coming back for more.", "images": [], "asin": "0553278398", "parent_asin": "0553278398", "user_id": "AFO4BFHMLIZNLUB6VKQF7TIGNGOA", "timestamp": 1489440676000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true}

Did I actually want to spend the money to buy this in hardback? Why not instead read one of the three Bryson books I still had in my &#34;to be read&#34; pile? So I picked up this one. The premise: Bryson, after years of living in England, comes home to the midwest (Iowa) in 1988 and drives around most of the country in a little Chevette (one of which I had once), commenting about the odd and the unusual.<br /><br />Well, there's some of that, some nice descriptions of a couple of national parks, and some nostalgia about family vacation trips when he was a kid. The rest is an endless kvetch, kvetch, kvetch about everything: the bad food, the ugly homes, the tourists\u2014Bill, Bill, Bill, you go to national parks and tourist areas and then complain about how crowded they are; should they be empty, just for your pleasure?\u2014looking for some Shangri-La of a small town. The funny part is that he travels through the Midwest and the South\u2014badmouthing everyone in the latter as if it were still 1955; he is astonished, apparently, that in 1988, black people and white people actually EAT together in the South!\u2014and can't find the ideal small town, then when he gets into New England and finds some picture-perfect ones, heavens, they're TOO perfect.<br /><br />Okay, I know he's supposed to be commenting wryly on the American scene, and his observations on tourist traps are spot on, but really, after pages and pages of this stuff, can you blame the reader if he or she is the one who wants to kvetch, kvetch, kvetch right back? Along the way he trashes country music, Mexican music, farmers, hillbillies...and heaven forbid that you are female and overweight! It seems every few pages or so he goes into a diatribe about obese women, which is rich considering he describes himself as overweight several times. Plus, as far as I can tell, the only things he liked that he saw were a few scenic spots, Cooperstown, and the Henry Ford Museum/Greenfield Village. He writes off Williamsburg because, you know, some of the buildings are reconstructed; doesn't like that all the treasures of the Smithsonian are now in separate buildings instead of piled higgledy-piggledy in the Castle to discover in a corner; and is sour because most places don't look like the pictures.<br /><br />Unless you like endless jokes about fat women, motor homes, and stereotypical waitresses, borrow this from the library, okay?", "images": [], "asin": "0060920084", "parent_asin": "0060920084", "user_id": "AGNSUP65FG6GKSCQJKEH7A4YZLEQ", "timestamp": 1454534323000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

He gets into the grime and muck of their motivations, their hopes and dreams, and gets you to root for them regardless of how despicable they might be.<br /><br />As a return after more than five years away from BT novels, Stackpole delivers an off-main arc story in this one. While it does not really serve as a good introductory novel to the BT universe, for those versed in the details and history it is exceptional.<br /><br />Focusing primarily on two main characters, a Wolf-in-Exile castoff named Verena who manages to achieve fame and rank through accident rather than design, and Alaric Wolf, a Clan Wolf Star colonel who considers himself a god amongst mortals destined to rule over all he surveys. Alaric happens to be the son of Katherine Steiner-Davion (known still as Katrina) and her brother, Victor, through some Clan genetic milkshake process.<br /><br />Through various machinations, the Wolf Clan chooses to relocate their entire nation and peoples from the occupation zone they carved into the Inner Sphere 80 years earlier (see Stackpole's Blood of Kerensky series) by cooperating with their wayward cousins, the Wolves-in-Exile, and the Lyran Commonwealth. To prevent their enemies from taking advantage of their move, Alaric lights upon a plan to distract them by announcing (and supposedly pursuing) the conquest of Terra, the long-ago goal of the Clan Invasion.<br /><br />In their feinted drive toward Terra, Alaric takes a planet and strips it of useful materiel. When another main character, Anastasia Kerensky of the Wolf Hunters merc unit arrives, his arrogance and presumption result in his capture. He learns a great deal about her and himself during the treatment he receives at her hands. He also meets Verena after her fame has catapulted her to heights she never expected, commanding a battalion of 'Mechs in defense of the region the Wolves are invading.<br /><br />Through her own obvious devious machinations, Anastasia returns Alaric to Clan Wolf, where he is tasked with commanding another planetary invasion that pits him against Verena.<br /><br />The end of the book clearly leaves a lot unresolved, something that never pleases me overmuch. Each book should stand alone, but since this is one book of many in a shared universe, threads have to be left hanging. While there is some resolution for parts of the characters' tales, the scale of the story is bigger than could be resolved in under 300 pages. Given that Stackpole's recent fare has topped 400 pages, this was little more than an appetizer for those who might collect the author's works.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Good For One Isn't Necessaril Good For All", "text": "I found this book to have a self important tone as the author seems to feel that because quitting poker was the right thing for him, it is the right thing for everyone.  The fact is we are all different and the right thing for one person isn't the right thing for someone else.  I like playing poker and it brings me enjoyment, but I won't say everyone should play.<br /><br />The book might have made a better case if the author was a highly successful player who walked away, but that's not what the player was.  It would also have been better if the author had a better self view of his &#34;success&#34;.  He thinks having made $2500 over seventeen months playing microstakes online means he was a successful player.  He was, if he is to be believed, a winning player, but does netting an average of about $147 a month make someone a successful player?  I don't think so.<br /><br />The author also doesn't have an accurate view of how his job ended at a second start-up.  At one point, he says he was fired, but then when he talks about what caused his [life] tilt, he says he quit.  You can't quit a job you were fired from and you can't be fired from a job you quit.<br /><br />As the author isn't a native English speaker, there are still a lot of grammatical &#34;errors&#34; in this third edition, but the book is fairly readable.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a sobering look at why microstakes poker wasn't right for the author.", "images": [], "asin": "1495282236", "parent_asin": "1495282236", "user_id": "AFF6DXJBTJW4NEN7DQRJLY2QIQXQ", "timestamp": 1499637080464, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Initial Book of Elena Oliverez Trilogy", "text": "This is the first book of Marcia Muller's Elena Oliverez  trilogy, beginning the exploits of her Hispanic art museum curator.  The second is: \"The Legend of the Slain Soldiers\" and the third and final is \"Beyond the Grave\" (co-authored with Bill Pronzini who is now Muller's husband).  Actually, I think this trilogy gets better book by book, so I actually liked this one the least of the 3.  But, it's interesting to see Muller write of protagonists other than Sharon McCone--demonstrates her breadth of talent.  She also authored the Joanna Stark trilogy about an art security expert.  This series is heavily into the world of Hispanic art but is heavily dosed with the personalities of its highly divergent characters--highlighting human foibles.  It is not a continuing saga like the Stark trilogy, but is connected in time and in the characters involved.  Interestingly, Muller gives Elena a cameo appearance in her latest Sharon McCone adventure: \"The Dangerous Hour.\"  I find Elena to be a very appealing character and admire Muller for delving into a somewhat different world for this trilogy; it's worth reading the entire trilogy.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "History Today and Yesterday", "text": "Simon Schama looks at four issues that have harbored in American history.  With a critical and detail eye, wars, religion, race and immigration reflect the events that have occurred in the United States since her founding and parallel the most recent as a result of the election of 2008.  This book is an elaborate historical commentary on American democracy and its present reawakening.  All of the pinnacle events mentioned in the book have played a part in shaping and changing the social, political, and religious landscape of the country and are discussed with the present in mind; there are links to America's ancestral past especially with Schama's examination of Quartermaster General of the Grand Army of the Republic, Montgomery C. Meets, who established war cemeteries as an act of domestic reparations during the Civil War and his long line of descendants who carried on the tradition of military and political service.<br /><br />THE AMERICAN FUTURE:  A HISTORY may be an advantageous title.  But the book rests highly on politicized commentary that stresses an editorial tone with references of present political actors, which may date the book years from now.  However, the various historical references examined may make-up for that part of the book, especially Schama's theme of democracy in America and Alexis de Tocqueville and the Founding Fathers.  This is the highlight of the book, although it is intermittently dispersed throughout Schama's narrative, as well as the other significant theme that complements the story of America, the self-made man.  Fellow Frenchman Hector St. John de Cr\u00e9vecoeur attempted to live the life and interpreted this aspect of American society within his legendary LETTERS OF AN AMERICAN FARMER narrative.<br /><br />For the most part, Schama parallels events from the seventeenth and nineteenth century, especially the era known as the Republic, with the twenty-first century.  As a historian, he meticulously caters each event within four sections of the book.  One may say that the entire book resonates a string of clich\u00e9s as it relates to not learning from history as well as a mirror of events that show how far America's has come since its inception and its future.", "images": [], "asin": "0060539232", "parent_asin": "0060539232", "user_id": "AFRIFKMM4R5IOOPR5CZX62IX3BPQ", "timestamp": 1242180627000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "If you are reading  Christie's mysteries", "text": "you might want to skip over this unless you are determined to read them all.  This is one of her lesser efforts that only make the rest of her work so much better.<br />The story is cleverly arranged into &quot;Acts&quot;, a reflection of the main character, Sir Charles Cartwright, a famous stage actor who is now retired.  Sir Charles hosts a dinner party which includes many who have connections with the stage:  Angela Sutcliffe, actress; Miss Willis, playwright; Capt. Darce and his wife, who run a theatrical dressmaking business; and Mr. Satterthwaite, wealthy patron of the arts (featured in the short story collection THE MYSTERIOUS MR. QUIN).  Rounding out the party are  Dr. Strange, a specialist in nervous disorder and a college friend; the local vicar and his wife; Lady Mary Lytton Gore and her daughter Hermione, Mr. Oliver Manders and Hercule Poirot.<br />The party proceeds predictably until a murder takes place (or maybe just proceeds predictably).  End of Act I, Act II weeks later another dinner party takes place miles aways, many, although not all, of the same guests are present and another murder takes place.  Act III, Poirot and others involved in the tragedies investigate the crimes and of course, Poirot solves the crime.<br />The characters of Mr. Satterthwaite and Hermione are delightful and well written and Poirot is his usual eccentric self.  Unfortunately the rest of the characters are  down right boring and totally forgetable. The plot itself is far better than the characters.  The crimes are cleverly done, there is the usual Christie twist at the end but even that cannot raise this beyond a passable rating.

I was expecting an unbiased evaluation of health care reform with a perspective from a doctor on what's best all-around, for us as patients and as Americans.  Instead, I got an extremely leftist, super-liberal book that is so obviously NOT an unbiased perspective from a doctor who is \"in the trenches,\" that I had to force myself to even finish it.  (which I did, because I wanted to give it a really fair opportunity to change the impression I got from the first few chapters of it).<br /><br />Since reading this book, I have paid more attention to Howard Dean and his opinions in the news, and I find him extreme and really over-the-edge.  I won't go any further into my own political feelings here, but as a reviewer I want you to realize before purchasing that if you are buying this book you should know ahead of time that it is written as a politician and left-winger first, and a doctor second (or third or fourth or whatever).<br /><br />So if you lean left, you'll love it.

I'm sure it is very tasty but I would have to buy them just to make this specific baby food and probably waste some of it because I don't use them for the meals for my husband and myself.

In Fact I skimmed the last half of this as fast as I could....<br /><br />I'm sure the right sort of reader will eat this up and add it to their favorites list. It does seem to be garnering a lot of positive attention. At least the publisher is making it seem like that with those heavy words \"Prepare to meet the genre's next star.\"<br /><br />Page 1 begins with an ominous scene. We\u2019re introduced to a boy named Kirian as he is in a jail cell with a \u201cdemon\u201d named Talon who is leaning on the outside bars begging for a story to be told on how he got there.<br /><br />And so he begins.<br /><br />And so does she.<br /><br />That\u2019s right. We are forced to follow not one but two different perspectives of the same story being told. We have two narrations here! There\u2019s Kihrins 1st person perspective talking about his recent events and then there\u2019s Talons 3rd person perspective talking about what happened before the events he\u2019s telling.. uhhhh. So yes, Talons chapters aren't about her. They're also about Kihrin.. in 3rd person.. but his name is Rook..<br /><br />Which would have been incredibly unique and interesting but I found it to be confusing and hard to follow. OH YEAH! There\u2019s also footnotes throughout the whole book...<br /><br />Not like I don\u2019t enjoy a complex story, I freaking do! Like give me all the complexity! But with the writing style, body swapping (where characters are actually not the characters you think they are) and the 10 page glossary in the back of the book of smash-your-face-on-keyboard names (including multiple nicknames for multiple characters) made up slangs for gangs, and kingdoms and faraway lands. This quickly became a chore. Adding insult to injury, I found the the main character Kihrin very unlikeable and did not enjoy reading the story he wanted to tell.<br /><br />I think if we had a linear plot line, it would have been much more enjoyable. It's so frustrating that its convoluted because there is a wonderful story and world that's sort of obstructed by the time and perspective jumps. The world building is beautiful and the rich history/cultures were *insert grabby hands*<br /><br />But all in all, I am left in a puddle of disappointment.

I hadn't read the  previous books and found these people to be nothing more than a huge  distraction because they did very little to enhance the love story.  But,  if you're a fan, you may love seeing these people again.<br /> The main story  focuses on Olivia Darling, a grumpy spinster who spent her best years  tending for an ailing aunt  who thanked her by berating her and destroying  her confidence.  Now that the horrid aunt has finally died Olivia is free  to live her life the way she chooses.  Sure that her childbearing years are  well behind her she has given up on her dreams of love and family and has  instead purchased a boarding house in Springwater.<br /> Olivia's first  boarder is Jack McLaughlin, a secretive civil-war survivor looking for a  quiet place to rest.  These two lonely, wounded souls make an immediate  connection but Jack's past haunts him and until he finds peace with himself  he is unable to give his heart to Olivia.<br /> Jack makes this often  predictable book worth reading.  He is simply a wonderful hero who really  leaps off the pages.  If you have a soft spot for wounded heroes you'll  love Jack.  Olivia, on the other hand, wasn't as easy to like.  She takes  the &quot;prickly&quot; heroine to a whole new level and often behaves like  a crabby granny rather than a thirty-two year old woman.<br /> Although I  wish the author had toned down the constant interruptions made by the  secondary characters this was still a better than average romance - all  because of Jack.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "This is not a guide book for self-help at home", "text": "This book does not deal with the problem of nerve entrapment due to any other cause but muscle tension. Many well-regarded pain-management professionals believe as much as 80% of the chronic pain conditions in this country are related to dysfunctional muscle tension, for example, Dr. Bernard Filner in Maryland. But those same proponents of this approach to chronic pain will also tell you that it is never a safe choice to assume that muscle tension is the cause, or even a contributing factor, in your particular pelvic pain without first undergoing adequate medical testing to rule out other potential causes. In the case of pelvic pain, nerve entrapment may also be caused by spinal-disc or abdominal-organ injury or disease; it may be caused by abnormal formations of hard-tissue structures entrapping nerves, or it may be due to adhesions, that is, fibrosis or scar tissue which clings to nerves. These types of medical issues will not be relieved by muscle-release techniques such as this book recommends.<br /><br />Sadly, not everyone in this country who has pelvic-floor pain has the material resources, family support, and patience in the face of extreme pain, to undergo the huge amount of medical screening involved to solve the riddle of pelvic pain, whose true origins are often extremely hard for physicians to determine. The initial diagnostic process is extensive, time consuming and, even with an excellent health-insurance policy, the out-of-pocket portion the patient is required to pay can be quite expensive. This screening process can involve some or all of the following: lab tests of the genitourinary system to check for possible infections; ultrasound, abdominal x-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for abnormal body structures or abnormal tissue growth; colonoscopy to check for diverticulitis or other inflammatory bowel disease; laparoscopy (a thin tube attached to a small camera inserted through a small incision in the abdomen) to closely examine abdominal organs to check for abnormal tissue growth or infections in the abdominal cavity; specialized nerve blocks to figure out which nerves in the pelvic region are being compressed. Many patients also undergo surgeries which often are not truly warranted because the surgeon's approach is a classic case of, \"When you only own a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" Surgeons are trained to cut, and each specializes in particular surgeries. If you go to a given surgeon, chances are high they will offer you the surgeries they know how to do, whether or not that particular surgery is what you need. On top of that, all surgeries, even those offered to remove scar tissue, lead to the body creating new scar tissue which can, in and of itself, become a new source of pain.<br /><br />If all of these tests listed above turn out to be normal, and/or the surgeries the patient has been put through by well-meaning doctors are a failure at eliminating pelvic pain--or create additional pelvic pain--then at that point, and out of sheer desperation, many pelvic-pain sufferers come to the idea of muscle tension as a last resort. It is important to know, though, that it is highly doubtful if insurance will cover a trip to Dr. Wise's clinic, and this book is *not* an offer by the doctor of a do-it-yourself, home-treatment program. Instead, it is a sales pitch for Dr. Wise's clinic.<br /><br />The only at-home care that Dr. Wise does offer in book form is in another book he has written, not this one. It is called [[ASIN:0972775587 Paradoxical Relaxation: The Theory and Practice of Dissolving Anxiety by Accepting It]]. Some people may find that book sufficient in and off itself to learn and practice on their own the particular type of relaxation technique that Dr. Wise prefers above all others of the countless relaxation techniques available today.<br /><br />The only other at-home-care opportunity on offer by Dr. Wise are those that he and the physical therapists on his staff train patients to do. These include specific stretches and his recommended method for using a special, rectal/vaginal probe that Dr. Wise invented to release deep, internal, trigger points in pelvic-floor muscles.<br /><br />For those who have gone through substantial testing to discover the cause of their pelvic pain and are mostly, but not 100%, sure that their pain is caused by a \"headache in the pelvis,\" or are simply desperate and looking for something, anything, that might possibly help their excruciating pelvic pain, one possible way to be sure before racing off to Dr. Wise's expensive clinic in California that you are a candidate for his treatment is to test out his main theory for yourself. Dr. Wise asserts that habitual \"tail tucking\" behavior (which happens when someone hangs their head or curls in fetal position when afraid, depressed, or in pain) is the cause of entrenched spasms of the pelvic-floor muscles. It is possible to mentally create a reaction in the body which is the opposite of this behavior by using the technique of [[ASIN:1590307801 visualization]].<br /><br />Visualization is a well-respected technique that has been used for many decades by professional athletes to enhance performance and medical patients to heal illness. Utilizing the image of tail-tucking, one could start out imagining oneself as an unhappy, frightened dog (perhaps one's own beloved pet--when I do this, I imagine my 10-lb rat terrier, Dottie, who frequently engages in tail-tucking behavior). Then, imagine your visualized dog-self becoming happy--your imaginary ears perk straight up, and so does your imaginary tail. Purposely put a smile on your face at the same time. When you do this while standing, you will notice that your head instinctively lifts up and the spine straightens, improving stooped posture, which physical therapists everywhere will inform you is a major contributor to back and neck pain. It is a simple matter to do this free, easy visualization multiple times a day for a few seconds. Not only does this visualization set up a new pattern in the body to counteract any unconscious tail-tucking, but the smile and the happy-dog visualization releases endorphins, which are known to be natural painkillers.<br /><br />Test out this visualization for at least a week. If you notice any amount of improvement in your pelvic pain, it is possible you might be a candidate for further training in methods of releasing your pelvic-floor muscles at the doctor's expensive clinic.<br /><br />I rate this book as follows:<br />Introduction of an interesting spin on pelvic pain with the tail-tucking concept: 4 stars<br />Self-help training for pain control at home: 1 star<br />Overall: 3 stars", "images": [], "asin": "0972775552", "parent_asin": "0972775552", "user_id": "AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A", "timestamp": 1377467910000, "helpful_vote": 59, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Bottom of the charts", "text": "What happened to David Mitchell since his Cloud Atlas masterpiece, his Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet stunner, and even his satisfying Bone Clocks? This is an author who has bended genres and brought me to my knees. However, Utopia Avenue\u2019s coverage of the counterculture 60s feels borrowed and Wiki\u2019d. By far, it\u2019s the worst slog by a notable, former first-rate author that I\u2019ve ever read, a migraine-inducing mash of mixed metaphors and insensate, ham-handed prose, bad poetry, and corny lyrics. It is riddled with clich\u00e9d, gaseous sentences that telegraph and italicize every thought and action. Here\u2019s a passage:<br /><br />\u201cJellyfish of colored light breed and smear the dancers and Jasper\u2019s mind is set adrift.\u201d Then in italics, \u201cAbracadabra, it\u2019s a boy, why not name him Jasper?\u201d (stop italics) \u201cWhy this name and not another?\u201d (start italics again) \u201cA friend? The stone? A long-lost lover?\u201d<br />\u201cPlenty more where we came from. A million per droplet of the stuff of life.\u201d<br /><br />Yeah, heavy, brother. Groovy.<br /><br />I should have been warned when Mitchell decided that Utopia\u2019s first album would be \u201cParadise is the Road to Paradise.\u201d Is this supposed to be clever? Mocking? He takes this novel seriously, and the levity is at best, puerile. How about these lyrics to their first hit, Darkroom:<br /><br />\u201cWe hid under trees from the rain and the dice; but under the trees the rain rains twice.\u201d<br />These aren\u2019t lyrics from counterculture music; it is the trivial stuff of a bubblegum chorus. (Exceptions are Richard Harris and Donna Summer, who can eloquently leave the cake out in the rain).<br /><br />It opens in 1967, and the premise is the rise and fall of a British rock band. The novel is structured in six sections by the three Utopia LPs (A and B sides), and each song centers on a different band member: Romeo-ish, cheating Dean, the bassist; Lennon-ish Jasper, the watchful and schizoaffectve-ish guitarist; Elf, singer and keyboard player with man problems; and Griff, the brash and nervy drummer from Yorkshire. The characters, like the story, are trite and swirl in the self-referential Mitchellverse. Levon, the manager, is a meta-reference to Bone Clocks. Jasper de Zoet\u2019s reference to Jacob is purposeful but insubstantial, like all of the meta- bombs. Perhaps Mitchell is reminding the reader that he once wrote novels with staying power.<br /><br />The author hammers home that it is the 60s by all the name-dropping and cameo appearances: Jagger, Bowie, Sandy Denny, Zappa, Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Jerry Garcia, Nina Simone, Pink Floyd, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, like the novel, their function is flimsy and clumsy, like Marc Bolan\u2019s, \u201cIf you want to understand me, read The Lord of the Rings. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d<br /><br />590+ pages of buzzwords, bromides, and banalities, swirling in Mitchell\u2019s past novels. A solid narrative stands on its own, without weak wink-wink plugs to an author\u2019s oeuvre. The Mitchellverse feebly tries to cover the shortcomings of this hubristic epic, but I wasn\u2019t fooled by this impersonation of an Experience. Gimme Jimi any day instead.<br /><br />I really dislike giving one star. So, in the spirit of 1.5, I\u2019ll round it up to two stars.", "images": [], "asin": "0812997433", "parent_asin": "0812997433", "user_id": "AFC4L6YCFUMKPSTZP4E4DS6E2PPA", "timestamp": 1595375075715, "helpful_vote": 119, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Still OK but not a great \"Rivers Of London\" addition", "text": "I discovered Ben Aaronovitch's PC Grant series last year when I picked up \"Midnight Riot\" on sale.  I don't read a lot of urban fantasy, so was surprised that I liked it so much.  I quickly read the rest of the series and pre-ordered \"Foxglove Summer\".<br /><br /> I loved the originality, energy and charm that ran through every book.  I even found Peter Grant's distinct Kentish town grammar (i.e., \"Beverly and me got in the car.\") charming rather than irritating.  Two things kept the series from being a solid five stars for me.  First, Aaronovitch's TV background showed in slightly choppy, confusing \"scenes\" that seemed intended to be filmed rather than read.  The other was that the character who should have been the most interesting (Nightingale) turned out to be a non-entity and never has developed much beyond that.  Oddly, neither of these are the major problem in \"Foxglove Summer\" (Nightingale barely appears) but it is my least favorite of the Grant books.<br /><br />The story takes place outside of London and it feels as though the more bucolic setting sucked the energy out of the story.  Not much happens and, other than a slight insight into Molly's background and an, um, \"incident\" between Peter and Beverly that may have ramifications later, very little adds to the Rivers of London mythos.<br /><br /> There is also an extreme oddity/illogic in the book that, unfortunately, I can't discuss without a major spoiler. Let's just say the little girl confusion irks me. The ending is very abrupt, seeming rushed and incomplete.<br /><br /> Peter Grant continues to be an interesting and charming character so the book was Ok but not much more than that.  I'm glad that I have it, but must admit that I'm a bit disappointed.  If the Rivers of London were a TV series (which is really how it reads) and each book a season, \"Foxglove Summer\" would be a \"special\" episode in the off season.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Delicate Lovely Prose, Obvious Archetypes", "text": "I believe that nowadays the fairy tale has taken somewhat of a backseat to other genres. It makes sense after all: in a world full of stories about the dead coming back to haunt us (zombies, crime scene investigations, accounts focusing on famous authors and artists rather than the what the authors and artists produced), and in which we know everything already, the fairy tale by comparison can seem startlingly antiquated and slow. Time moves in a linear fashion, and plot advances in tidy bundles. We *know* that true love conquers all, and that the virtuous and brave will succeed in the end, no matter how they falter. We know that we are to heed these tales and trust our instincts. So what else? If we are to read and appreciate fairy tales in this day and age (and we still do despite our changing interests), we must go a step further in our understanding of them in order for them to give meaning to our lives. Whether it's as simple as the blockbuster YA retelling of Cinderella, \"Ella Enchanted\" by Gail Carson Levine, which was successful because Ella was educated, slightly clumsy, and charmingly snarky, or the stunningly sensual and beautiful \"Kissing the Witch\" by Emma Donaghue (mature readers only) which revisits gender roles and female sexuality in traditional tales, the modern retelling or rehashing of the traditional fairy tale is extremely popular.<br /><br /> \"Wildwood Dancing\" is a traditional fairy tale based on two well-known stories: The Twelve Dancing Princesses and The Frog Prince. Set in rustic olden day Romania, The story is about five sisters: one beautiful, one sensible, one scholarly, one flirty, and one little. Every full moon they journey to another world filled with fairies and trolls and magic to enjoy a night of dancing, returning in the wee hours of the morning. All is fine and well until their ailing father leaves them and their sinister, sexist cousin moves in to take over their affairs. His very presence also threatens their chances of journeying into the other world, which takes place in the woods, which he hates. Through the book's events, which go from bad to worse, the ultimate question turns out to be whether or not true love can save the day.<br /><br /> I ended up enjoying Marillier's lovely, elegant story, despite everything. She writes in a slow, carefully wrought, pretty way that suits the fairy tale genre. However, I do think that it lacks a great deal. The main character Jena, who narrates the story, is a strong, sensible, feisty young lady in keeping with traditional fairy tale roles, and she must learn to trust her instincts in order to solve her problems. However, it seemed to me that she understood her own shortcomings and what was happening in the atmosphere around her much too well. When she learns her lessons, she overly explains to us the folly of her previous ways, even though she is self-aware when she commits those follies. Also, one of her shortcomings was being a control freak, which she was, but I never got the feeling that she overcame that, despite her attempts to assure the reader that she did. She had a tight hand in everything right up until the end, and I believe she loved being the center of attention. I wouldn't have minded this (character flaws are always welcome) if I didn't have the nagging suspicion that Marillier desperately wanted to convince the reader that Jena had some sort of breakthrough. I also thought her relationship with her beloved \"pet\" frog was at times mighty cloying, to the point where it became uncomfortable.<br /><br /> But the main problem I had with \"Wildwood Dancing\" goes back to my original point. I don't believe that Marillier ever fully made the tale her own. I was okay that she borrowed from other fairy tales, but there was nothing that spoke \"new\" to me. I could never quite believe in the magic of the other world, perhaps because they didn't spend enough time there, or perhaps there was too *much* magic to contend with. Sisters placidly enjoying the realm of fairies, goblins, vampires, witches, trolls, etc. etc. etc. becomes very un-magical to me if it is not explored. The female characters are all weak when it comes to love (one becomes quite literally on the verge of death) and the ones that need to be \"tamed\" into loving submission do---nothing new for a fairy tale. Still, however, I adored the incorporation of the Romanian landscape and history into the tale. I would suggest that Marillier incorporate even more regional sensibilities into her future works---not only items and landscapes but sensibilities and world views, too. I believe that writing even more about Romania in \"Wildwood Dancing\" would have given Marillier's book the edge to set the book apart from the others.<br /><br /> Though flawed, I would recommend this book to girl who adores fairy tales and romantic love. If nothing else it's sweet, and Marillier's writing is more than formidable.", "images": [], "asin": "0375844740", "parent_asin": "0375844740", "user_id": "AGKNPX3S4L2KQCL5SF4WKBIAQSRQ", "timestamp": 1302478549000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Dated collection of MEDiocre SciFi short stories", "text": "This book is basically an anthology of six novelettes and two novellas, chronicling the interstellar travels of Med Ship Man Calhoun and his alien sidekick Murgatroyd (kind of an intelligent mix between a small dog and a monkey, and who has special immune system traits), using the spaceship Aesclipus Twenty.  These stories originally appeared in various SciFi magazines during the late-50s thru mid-60's.  I somehow managed to get thru all the stories, and following are reviews of each of them:<br /><br />** MED SHIP MAN (Novellete, 1963) - While the technology used by the bad guys is believable, the plot involves too many coincidences.  The pushy businessman character who basically forces his way down to the \"apparently deserted\" planet is way too shallow.  Calhoun obviously doesn't like ANY businessmen, supposedly because of the way the businessmen treated people and animals on the planet Texia.  With the mystery of the deserted planet just beginning, almost immediately Calhoun suspects the businessmen as the bad guy.  Well, the businessman ends up being from Texia, and he is involved with a scheme using cattle herding technology from Texia, to herd people on Maya away from the cities, so he can buy prime real estate dirt cheap.<br /><br />** PLAGUE ON KRYDER II (Novellete, 1964) - The trusting Calhoun bumbles thru and dodges multiple attempts on his life while interfering with a pack of interstellar bandits who take advantage of planets, upon which they have unleashed plagues.<br /><br />** THE MUTANT WEAPON (Novella, 1957) - A story of a biological warfare attack on a newly colonized planet.  This story contains some excellent detailed descriptions of Leinster's Planetary Grid and Interstellar Drive technologies, but also contains a lot of backward technology; for example, reel-to-reel tape drives.  There are some good parts that give a decent picture of the horrors of germ warfare<br /><br />**+ RIBBON IN THE SKY (Novellete, 1957) - A semi-decent story, with more backwards technology (e.g. Calhoun has to manually perform photo comparisons, something a computer has been able to do long ago).  The most interesting parts are related to human biological theories, based on separated human populations; and this even leads to a bit of romance.  This is possibly the best story of the collection (but that isn't saying much).<br /><br />** TALLIEN THREE (Novellete, 1963) - Calhoun & Murgatroyd arrive at planet to do a routine medical survey, and lo and behold, the planet is experiencing a biologically-based revolution, that ends up being masterminded by yet another mad scientist gone bad.  Crummy plot in general, but the nightmarish technology causing the population to be turned into garbage-eating ghouls is unique, to say the least, and future computer technologies are described pretty well, considering this was written in 1963.<br /><br />** QUARANTINE WORLD (Novellete, 1966) - A seemingly pefectly healthy world undergoes a Medical Service inspection - but things are just a bit too perfect.  It turns out that another \"plague\" is being hidden from the rest of the Galaxy, for \"evil business purposes\" (Leinster is definately a socialist, if not a communist, at heart).  Nothing very different about this story than the rest.<br /><br />* THE GRANDFATHERS' WAR (Novellete, 1957) - A colony is forced to evacuate their younger people to another star system, when their star becomes unstable and threatens to go nova.  The overworked younger people become embittered against the older generation and rebel.  Oh, and of course there is great sickness brewing amongst the youngest people on the new colony... this story could have actually been good, given a Twilight Zone-like ending - but it ends up with some highly unlikely rocket heroics by Calhoun, and a sappy kiss-and-makeup ending.<br /><br />** PARIAH PLANET (Novella, 1961) - Calhoun is sent to a sector neglected by the Med Service for far too long, and encounters a planet whose inhabitants are subjected to famine and rascist isolationism by another more well to do planet in a nearby solar system.  This could have been one of the better stories in the book, but the persistant meddling by Calhoun in the two planets' affairs made me think that MED SHIP didn't stand for MEDical SHIP, but really stood for MEDdling SHIP.<br /><br />At the time this review was written, this book was available on the Baen Online Free Library (and if it wasn't, I wouldn't have wanted to pay more than a bargain-shelf book price to read this dated collection of SciFi stories).<br /><br />Murray Leinster was considered one of the pioneers of \"modern\" SciFi writing, and was a longtime mainstay of the genre.  If nothing else, some folks might get a kick out of sampling some of his writing by reading one or two of the stories from this anthology.  He does a pretty good job describing some of his more advanced technologies; for instance the Planetary landing grids, and interstellar travel mechanisms.  However, his older stories didn't even foresee the use of observation satellites or spy planes which were to become common place just a few years after the stories were written (in the book rockets are launched to take photographs).  And, lets face it, the stories are somewhat slow-paced/dull, and the character development does not stand up to what we expect to find in present day SciFi stories.  Oh, and could we have some good-looking women, please?  And finally, these stories have a strong and na\u00efve socialist leaning (in one story all businessmen are seen as evil, and in others economic classes are virtually non-existent).<br /><br />NOTE1: Some folks have complained about the incessant repetition of simple facts... the reason there is so much repetition, is because this is a collection of independent stories that were originally designed to be read separately; so, in each story he has to repeat descriptions of technologies and main character's traits (especially Murgatroyd's).  The net result is that the stories get more and more repetitive and boring as you make your way thru the book.<br /><br />NOTE2: The medical spaceship Aesclipus Twenty is named after the Greek/Roman God of medicine and healing Asclepius/Aesculapius.", "images": [], "asin": "0743435559", "parent_asin": "0743435559", "user_id": "AHME6Y36XVBFNXYSOX6LCAQPUZZQ", "timestamp": 1114011649000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

Every chapter of the witness, the Father, and the friend is a redundant, woe is me chapter which at the end is irrelevant. The private investigator's biggest contribution is somehow recognizing that a hostage isn't the missing girl based on body shape. Something the girls family somehow failed to see first. The story is full off random characters that have little to do with the story. The author could have added humpty dumpty to the list of pointless characters. The author uses the epilogue to try to close the holes in her story and tie-in the random characters as people that were truly behind everything. Eye roll. Character development is non-existent. We know more about the family dog Sammy than we do from the missing girl Anna. I would have felt more emotions if the dog had died. The author reveals what happened to Anna in one sentence in the epilogue.<br />This book should have been called \"You disgust me\" since it's the sentence that shows up the most in this book.

I thought the movie was fairly good and so, I thought, the book must be great.

He's your stereotypical, aging white man that turns to alcohol to ease his troubles. He mourns his wife but spends most of his time brooding and drinking. A daughter/child is mentioned early in the novella but then never again.<br /><br />The thing that endeared me most to the movie was the dog, Sam. It gave Will Smith's character depth and an excuse for dialogue. There is no dog in this book. There is no dialogue.<br /><br />The ending is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny. I would love to enlighten you all and save you the pain but I don't want to be a `spoiler'.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst part of this `book' is that it's actually only about 150 pages. The rest of the book is filler of other short stories. Fine. Except nowhere on the book (cover or back) does it say this. It felt extremely deceitful to not disclose that half the book was short stories. Also, there is no division between I Am Legend and the rest of the stories.

Mostly furniture, but also anything that comes my way, as I do not like to turn down work. I purchased the book, thinking that if there were just a few good tricks and techniques it would be worth the money. I was disappointed.

They can have errors. If you are reading a manual and do not understand something, it is usually you. However, I do find manuals with errors all the time.

If you are going to do a swing set assembly with a manual that is 100+ pages, having a spare copy certainly helps, especially if you do not have to pay for the printing costs.<br /><br />I did not see a discussion of dealing with stripped screws and bolts.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Confusing for the biblical neophyte", "text": "I wish I had better things to say about this collection of jokey paraphrases and retellings of classic Bible stories. Lord knows, the book is large-hearted enough. But it just does not live up to its subtitle, \"Introducing the Bible by telling its Stories.\" After reading the stories, it's hard to know where the joking stops and the Bible storyies begin. Those who are already familiar with the tales might enjoy a humorous rettling of an old chestnut, but those who don't know the Bible well will be confused and possibly misled. The story of Noah is a good example. We learn a bit about Gilgamesh and the flood epics in the ancient near east, but we learn only peripherally the basic story element that Noah took animals (two by two) with him into the ark. Venturing into the New Testament, the Last Supper and Crucifixion get scant attention. We hear that Jesus rides into Jerusalm on a donkey, but don't know why.<br /><br />Bob Darden frames the Bible stories in their context as myth, and lists the standard facets of mythical stories as laid out by Joseph Campbell. But this has the effect of diluting the importance of biblical stories (what's the biggie if they are only myths?) and suggesting that every biblical story has mythical elements. The bible has its share of mythical stories, but also plenty of poetry, prophetic critique and even royal propaganda.<br /><br />I admire Darden for trying to make the Bible more accessible to a growing generation of the biblically illiterate. His references to Star Wars, Harry Potter, Narnia, and Star Trek reach out to those familiar with these modern myths. But the young (and increasingly their parents) don't know the bible stories to begin with. Riffing on them is just confusing.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing", "text": "George DeWolfe is an internationally recognized photographer. He is well known for his workshop on the master print, and I believe this book is based in part on this course. (I have not taken the course.)<br /><br />It's important to realize that this book was written by a photographer with decades of experience in darkroom work. Thus visual evaluation of prints is paramount to obtaining his desired result. So DeWolfe recommends leaving auto settings off, and your eyes and brain to 'see' the print. The workflow he presents uses an approach I have not seen elsewhere, and my initial trials are very pleasing. He suggests that in Adobe Camera Raw, saturation be reduced to -100 to view a B&W version of the image, and adjusting to achieve the best image based on luminance values. Saturation is restored afterward. This makes perfect sense photographically, and it works! With too many Photoshop books being written by Photoshop gurus with little talent in photography, this is a breath of fresh air!<br /><br />What disappoints here is that there are so few examples in the book on evaluating images. This is clearly DeWolfe's strong point and more would have been better. Indeed, he shows a number of \"images from hell\" he uses in his workshops to show case what can be done with his technique, but these are not included with the book, or available on his web site. He also describes a process he calls outlining, but unfortunately there are no explicit details.<br /><br />In general, I would say that the author has assembled a collection of Photoshop techniques he has learned to use very well, and, of course will work for the reader. Many go back several versions in Photoshop, but are no longer current or best practice. For example, he describes a workflow which creates a set of layers for global, local and defect correction, based on a layer copy of the original image. This should lead to non-destructive adjustments, and in fact he recommends saving this layered version in case future adjustments are necessary. However, in one example, he applies separate balancing corrections to the left and right sides of image copy layer directly then saves the file. Neither of these changes can be re-adjusted individually, other than by adding more corrections on top, or deleting the layer copy and start over. It is quite possible to make identical adjustments using the gradient / mode technique on real layers that can be individually changed later.<br /><br />This book promotes the use of a few specific tools, especially Optipix 3.1, to achieve certain outcomes that would usually require tedious and repetitious effort to achieve. I have no problems with this since several additional tools, as well as comparable Photoshop features are also discussed. An Optipix Demo is available for download and evaluation. Such time saver tools are wonderful if they meet your expectations.<br /><br />His discussion of interpolation to larger image sizes is based on comparisons of third part tools with the Photoshop \"bicubic\" interpolation method. But Photoshop CS2 has a new and much better tool for this called \"bicubic smoother\" that improves greatly on bicubic. Thus you might be mislead into using a tool that is less capable than Photoshop. Again, trial versions will be useful before purchase.<br /><br />The author devotes some attention to correcting color casts and white balance in Photoshop, an important and frequently needed adjustment. He totally omits any discussion of the use of gray cards in the establishment of more exact settings. While final white balance and color are always the prerogative of the artist, this seems really strange for an Ansel Adams 'trainee'.<br /><br />Overall, I find the book decidedly under-edited. There are several areas where the reader can become confused. Pages 142 and 143 describe adjustment of overall contrast and brightness for grayscale images. However the resulting image has a distinct color cast vs the original gray. Looks very much like a selenium toned B&W print! Perhaps this is the intent, but it is not described as such. Pages 144 to 147 show a similar adjustment for color (RGB) images, yet the image appearing in the channel clipping displays is not the image being adjusted. Go figure.<br /><br />On page 59, the use of a Wrattan 90 to previsualize contrast is described. This technique is well known. (Ansel Adams has given similar tools to his workshop students.) But the original photograph shown, as we discover later on page 178, is not the original image, but one greatly modified though the suggested workflow. So what is the Wrattan 90 really doing?<br /><br />So, two stars for the fine and unique content provided by DeWolfe on visualization and use of desaturation in the image work flow. Follow his Photoshop technique initially, but read elsewhere for finer control in Photoshop. Let's hope the second edition has more DeWolfe!", "images": [], "asin": "0072260874", "parent_asin": "0072260874", "user_id": "AHQNQDK427R5ZCZOQBRZAWGJWLYQ", "timestamp": 1152024320000, "helpful_vote": 97, "verified_purchase": true}

That's the feeling I got reading this book by Lawrence Block, still one of my favorite crime writers.  But, this may be his worst effort.  It's the tale of a serial killer, a girl in her twenties whose goal is to return to each man she has had sex with and kill them.  No reason given.  It was clear why she killed her parents, because of years of sexual abuse as a child.  But beyond that, she never explains why she is doing it, except that it feels good.  Another major weakness: she never comes close to being caught.  There's no suspense here.  It's just sex, slash, and move on.  The book jacket says this is \"A Novel of Sex and Violence.\"  The violence is hardly anything.  True she kills, but it's quick and done.  The sex is fairly plain until she discovers lesbianism.  This appears to be a book that Block wrote for the publisher Hard Case Crime, whose stock in trade seems to be sex and violence, but little suspense.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "An engaging mystery combined with empty dilemmas: it starts well but goes downhill. Not recommended", "text": "Every day, Isserley drives the roads of the Scottish Highlands looking for beefy male hitchhikers to pick up--but not for the reasons that anyone would expect. Isolated from home, out of place among the hitchhikers, Isserley is the only link between two cultures. Under the Skin is a nightmare to summarize and even harder to review because the truth of Isserley's identity and role is a huge spoiler which is crucial to book's plot and message. Nonetheless it's safe to say: the first half of the book is an engaging, enjoyable, if imperfect mystery, but the second half is bogged down by impersonal identity issues and empty ethical quandaries. The book is a mixed bag: promising, well-intentioned, but ultimately flawed. I don't recommend it.<br /><br />Under the Skin is an odd beast: it's a fresh, unusual book, entirely well-intentioned, but littered with problems. It's also a beast to discuss without spoiling the story for potential readers--so this review may tend towards vague. The book falls approximately into two halves: before, and after, the revelation of Isserley's identity. Before is suspenseful: a slow journey through unexplained events and subtle hints builds up the mystery of Isserley's life and her true identity. This journey is so slow, in fact, that it sometimes drags; the outsider's perspective of Isserley's unsettling identity makes her a stranger to the reader, and so she's unfortunately unsympathetic. Nonetheless it's a hell of a ride: a mystery which grows stranger and stranger, drawing the reader in with a tangle of clues, startling him with the simple, yet utterly alien reveal. This half of the book is atmospheric and engrossing, fresh and unusual, and well worth reading.<br /><br />After revealing the truth of Isserley's identity, the book explores the nature of her in-between identity and the ethics of her role. (Vague, yes?) This section is well-intended but constantly faulted. Isserley's disconnected dual identity isn't sufficient alien (nor convincing), but nor (as mentioned above) is she sufficiently sympathetic, so her issues of identity are promising but ultimately unsatisfying. Her ethical dilemma is thoughtful, but it's ultimately too clear-cut and preachy to hit home. And the book entire has a weak plot--that no problem when there's suspense to propel the book, but the second half feels undirected, making Isserley's concerns seem more like navel-gazing that personal revelation. Finally, the book hash a cop-out ending which leaves a sour taste and makes Isserley's journey meaningless. This second half has potential and the best of intentions, but it's a disappointment. I'm not sure how Faber could have improved his book--shrinking the distance between Isserley and reader? taking a different angle on the impact of her identity? making her identity more believably alien? Regardless, I can't recommend a book which is only half good. As enjoyable as it's unfulfilling, as engaging as it's empty, Under the Skin is a mixed bag. Pick it up if you're curious, because there's some good to pull from it--but on the whole, I don't recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "0156011603", "parent_asin": "0156011603", "user_id": "AFEURQMGWI3LXF5Y5SAFUT5CUMOA", "timestamp": 1245711860000, "helpful_vote": 31, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Excellent Cartoons with Some Disturbing Tales", "text": "What drew me to this graphic novel was the amazing pictures that had such fantastic details and were so skillfully drawn. Of course, I can also never resist a book on the circus/carnival. At first glance, the crowded and overwhelming number of pictures seemed perfect for the circus atmosphere that often time has multiple acts all running simultaneously. However, I felt that the plot and characters in this graphic novel left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Shadlowland includes ten different stories that are all set in either the circus or a carnival with the characters that are larger than life such as clowns, midgets, bearded ladies, voodoo witches the size of one's thumb and many more true \"characters\". The first story is about a sideshow high diving pig that has past his prime and must watch as he is replaced by a younger pig. Another story is told by the circus owner's wife, who is a midget, and the sketchy dealings that her husband (a clown who is always in makeup) makes in order to keep the circus afloat.<br /><br />Deitch gives the reader an interesting cast of characters and tells each of their stories in vignettes. Still, this was not enough to keep my attention. Some of the story lines turned extremely sexually graphic which deterred me from reading them while others felt as if they had been done before. While the illustrations are what first won me over, I soon found myself overwhelmed by what was going on in the illustrations. The more time I spent hunched over the graphics, the more I forget what the plot was and had to go back to the beginning.

For the past several years she cared for her terminally ill father and supported the two of them with a full-time job.  She's ready to embark on an adventure to fulfill a life-long ambition: to jillaroo on a sheep or cattle station. However, all advertised positions she runs across require previous experience she doesn't have. Not one is willing to take on a \"first-year.\" No  worries! An old school chum's father is responsible for locating and recommending a jillaroo to one of his clients. The friend, Guy, convinces Shannon that she's a cinch to get away with pretending to know what's what once she got on site.  Of course, the masquerade goes nowhere under the scrutiny of the owner ...<br /><br />The character of Shannon starts out clear-eyed and level-headed in the beginning of the story. She's had to be to survive the last couple of years caring for her father and successfully holding down a job. Once on station, however, she becomes this whining, sarcastic, petulant child! Mark Seymour, the owner of Tuesday Park, is a Neanderthal. His answer to every ensuing conflict with Shannon is the threat of sexual abuse.  Written in a different time for a different audience where, perhaps, this was acceptable repartee. But I doubt it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Two Sad Stars :-(", "text": "This was a thriller that had promise but did not deliver. I hate to say this because you don\u2019t ever want to blame the parent (especially if you do not have kids like me) but it was all Marin\u2019s fault: She was in an extremely busy area with her young son and texting. Not only texting, but it wasn\u2019t really important! She took her eyes off of her son at the height of Christmas shopping season!  So basically I did not have empathy for Marin while listening to the audiobook.<br /><br />Then, the direction the novel goes did not bring anything new to the thriller genre for me.  It wasn\u2019t really a thriller either; it was an average suspense novel.  The direction it goes in is a bit far-fetched, but then when we ultimately find out whom the \u2018villian\u2019 is it isn\u2019t surprising and neither is their motive.<br /><br />This one just did not deliver, but I would give Hillier another chance to see if one of her other novels works for me.  She may be another author that \u2018isn\u2019t for me\u2019.  The one saving grace for me with Little Secrets was the narrator Kirsten Potter.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Jurassic Park XVIII", "text": "How many ways can modern humans interact with strange beasts of ancient origin?  There's cloning, time travel, space travel to alternate Earths and of course, lost islands.  Numerous scientific problems are present here. How did the island escape the great cataclysms that nearly wiped out life on earth three times in the past 500 millions years?  Or, if evolution is a general phenomenon, why would it act in such a strange way on this one island?  And how can such a diverse multitude of creatures coexist with all we know about predators and prey and eventual outcomes?<br /><br />The weakest point concerns the arthropods could somehow evolved into an anthropomorphic state, instantly learning and speaking our language.  It's absurd. The historical allusion gets us off to a good start.  That is followed by the reality show and all its quirky happenings. What the book is missing is a central character, a firm base around which the tale can develop.  There are scientist of all stripes - a smart-ass, cynical publicity hound, an unassuming African American, a beautiful woman, etc along with media and political folks.  Not a lot of \"character growth\".  LOL<br /><br />The human-like species that emerge in the end prove the biggest disappointment.  Their world view would be as different from ours as a spider's or extraterrestrial and their peaceful disposition contradicts all we know about the island.  Humorously, we're told that their ability to become invisible has kept them alive right after we read of creatures who attack by smell! And lest we forget, there's the shower scene where our new buddies blithely scrub before casually climbing into their first beds.<br /><br />On the plus side, the discussions of lie spans, sex and child bearing were extremely interesting and carried to their logical conclusion on the island.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Enjoyable", "text": "I watched Terminator 2 at a very young age. (Why 2? Because it is obviously the superior one) I think that it made a huge impression on me. It single handily created my love of sci-fi. In Partials the enemy might not be straight up robots but I was just as intrigued by genetically engineered organic beings. Throw a plague in on top of that and you definitely have a book I must read. I went into Partials with high expectations...maybe they were too high because I loved a lot of things but I also had a few issues with it.<br /><br />The concept is brilliant. I loved everything about it. I'm always fascinated by post-apocalyptic settings and this one was done really well. I found the Partials to be interesting, although they didn't necessarily live up to the scary hype the characters built for them. This might sound odd but I enjoyed the plague aspect of the story as well, but the chapters where Kira was just doing medical tests and experiments were very, very tiresome. I didn't mind it at first but it goes on for a long time. This leads me to my first issue, I feel like the book could have been much shorter.<br /><br />I didn't love the characters, but I didn't dislike them either. Samm was probably my favorite. He was very mysterious. I liked him from the very start. I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but I found him very sympathetic.<br /><br />I also guessed a big secret plot point within 20 pages. Then it seemed like it took forever to be revealed. I don't usually mind if I figure things out quickly but the pacing was fairly slow and I got pretty impatient at times.<br /><br />I still enjoyed the story.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Enigmatic...incomplete", "text": "This was a toughie for your beleagured wiseguys of \"Le Reviewe de' Rotten\" - an anthology of four stories dealing with alienation, self-loathing and loneliness in different measures.  Not so much stories, they look (and read) more like snapshots - still images of various lives.  Instead of a story arc, Tomine's stories look more like a trajectory of descent just short of a crash.  (taking that metaphor another step, Tomine leaves out the final impact, leaving it to the reader to determine what the outcome is; typically, I'd skip that last page by accident, then have to go back a few pages to inform the cryptic events of the last few panels.  Tomine seems to leave enough for the reader to choose either a happy or unhappy ending.)<br /><br />In \"Alter Ego\", Martin is a failed novelist - he has transformed a painfully unmemorable youth into a slightly memorable first novel.  Having mined all of his unfulfilled life into an arguably failed career as a writer, Martin has yet to publish a follow-up book, and now writes magazines articles and ghostwrites semi-fictitious bios for celebrities.  Though he has a girlfriend when the story starts out, Martin nursed an unrequited passion for a classmate in HS - a girl who may have sent a flattering postcard bearing no return address or last name.  Despite his ongoing healthy relationship, Martin takes off for his HS dream and instead finds her younger sister and the wreck of the family the older girl left behind.<br /><br />In \"Bomb Scare\" a young boy and girl are thrown together by the wicked dynamics of high-school.  He (ostracized because of his only friend's overt-yet-ambiguous sexual orientation) and she (cast out when her rep as a plaything for jocks culminates in a moment of scatological humiliation at a party) don't even like each other.  Can a relationship form based on being on the outs with rest of the world?<br /><br />In \"Hawaiian Getaway\", Hilary is the older and less-adjusted of two daughters of an Asian family.  While her younger sister is on her way to med school, Hilary can barely keep her job as a phone operator for a catalog.  She is painfully unable to even begin small talk, let alone maintain a career or a relationship.  Is it Hilary that's messed up, or the world?  She, may learn the answer when - having taken up phone-pranking - she hooks up a possible boy friend.<br /><br />The best of the stories is \"Summer Blonde\", in which Neil - who manages the lay-out for porn classifieds at a small,  local news-rag - must contend with Carlo, a sexually insatiable poser with a guitar who has just moved in.  Neil, who is sex-starved himself, can barely tolerate Carlo before the new neighbor sets his sights on Neil's dream girl, the \"Summer Blonde\" herself.  The story surpasses the others in its more complex character dynamics.  Neil's more pathetic than creepy, but our sympathy has its limits.  He should be happy, but why there's something selfish about desires that fixate on young summer blondes (it's a point made by his therapist - Neil has a right to be happy, but he discriminates against women who aren't young or otherwise nubile).  The subject of Neil's unwanted attentions is aware of Neil, but he's not even no. 2 on her pecking order - instead, she really does think he's a creep, and from her vantage point it's easy to see why.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \"Summer Blonde\" feels more incomplete than enigmatic.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not as good as the others", "text": "I read the original Fancy Nancy book to my nieces, and, at the time, thought that the effect of Nancy stopping every other word to explain that \"That's a fancy word for so-and-so\" was a little annoying. Having now read several of the early readers, I can honestly say that it is MUCH less annoying when you're not the one reading the book aloud!<br /><br />My niece (who is six and entering the first grade in a week!) found this book easy enough to read with only a little help from me. Help largely consisted of asking her to sound out a word a second time, asking her if the sentence \"makes sense\" the way she read it, or asking if she's SURE she saw a d (or b, or w) in that word. There were a few words I had to read *for* her, but not more than I'd expect from this style of book. However, it should be noted that she was one of the better readers in her kindergarten class.<br /><br />The \"fancy words\" in this book range from the useful - biography, select - to the more fanciful - crestfallen, plume.<br /><br />I'm a little surprised at how much Nancy's parents enable the \"learning lesson\" at the end. They don't just let her work on the cover to the exclusion of everything else (albeit with a few warning comments that she needs to leave time for the REPORT part of the report), they actively take her to the store to get the supplies for this. (Apparently beads + yarn + fringe = INDIAN.) And Nancy's teacher is also super-understanding - she tells Nancy to just tell them about the book, so far so good, but she doesn't tell her to make up her report that night. That strikes me as a little unrealistic.<br /><br />I'm also concerned with some of the misconceptions shared in this book. Nancy repeats the line about Sacajawea being an \"Indian princess\", which she plainly wasn't. Nobody said that about her until a good 70 years after her death, in fact. As that's just about the only information we get about her in this book (which isn't about Sacajawea, so that's fair), it's a little disappointing that it's wrong.<br /><br />I will also note that there are an awful lot of sentences on each page.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Enjoyed the world building", "text": "Thank you to Bloomsbury YA and NetGalley for giving me a chance to read this eARC.<br /><br />We are Blood and Thunder follows two main female characters, Lena, who has a mark on her face, no family and was raised as a cryptling in Duke\u2019s Forest. She was assistant to the city mortician. Then there is Constance, a mage who comes back home to Duke\u2019s Forest to help get rid of the toxic storm cloud that has been circling above Duke\u2019s Forest for years.<br /><br />Nothing is what it seems with either women. We follow their journeys and find out if the storm cloud can be defeated at all.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br /><br />*The world building is fascinating with different mage factions. We only get a glimpse of a few of them but I think there is so much potential to learn more about this fantasy world. The people in Duke\u2019s Forest don\u2019t use magic, they worship their Ancestors \u2013 the dead that are buried below their city in crypts. Their way of life is to serve them. Outside of Duke\u2019s Forest is where magic thrives.<br /><br />*Lena interested me more than Constance. Lena is an orphan raised as a cryptling, assisting the city\u2019s mortician. She is without family, raised basically with dead bodies but then things start happening to her, she has power. More power than she ever had in her life.<br /><br />*Emris, a huntsman mage, is Lena\u2019s introduction into life outside of Duke\u2019s Forest. He teaches her about her magic and power. Theirs is a friendship that grows and I was glad Lena had someone.<br /><br />*This story was gory and dark at times! There was dark magic, necromancy and dead bodies coming to life. I thought that was fun, haha, morbid yes but I liked that it went there.<br /><br />Things That Made Me Go Hmm:<br /><br />*I needed MORE from this story \u2013 I felt like there was so much potential with the world building and I didn\u2019t get enough. Also I felt like the characters, or maybe mostly Constance, was superficial. Even her supposed romance with Xander was so quick and strange, I was like\u2026??\u2026am I supposed to feel something about these two? Because I feel\u2026nothing.<br /><br />*I didn\u2019t vibe with Constance but by the end, my feeling about her was right. So maybe there was a reason why something about felt off! There were some parts of this book that felt a bit melodramatic and it was mostly to do with Constance. \ud83e\udd28<br /><br />*The story did drag a bit, especially with this problem of this toxic storm cloud hovering over Duke\u2019s Forest. Like\u2026what is it? Why is it there? Why Duke\u2019s Forest? It ties in all at the end, but it took awhile to get there \u2013 to the point I didn\u2019t know why Constance\u2019s story mattered. It matters\u2026but in the beginning I wanted to skip her parts to read about Lena.<br /><br />*The twist at the end was surprising but, Constance again, to me\u2026ruined it. I just did not like her!<br /><br />*Triggers: death, being around dead bodies<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I enjoyed the world building, Lena and the necromancy in this book but I really needed more. Overall, this book fell short for me in so many areas, but it did keep my interest enough to want to know what was the whole deal with the toxic storm cloud! It was just an okay read for me.", "images": [], "asin": "1408898055", "parent_asin": "1408898055", "user_id": "AFJP3IQINRRY6C4VEGEZGOBHWQQQ", "timestamp": 1583532892964, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Blind Outside Thesis", "text": "This book's title is not clear.  It does not describe the process of spilling oil.  Instead, its focus is entirely on the effects of oils spills and methods to clean up after them.<br /><br />The is not well written and not well researched.<br /><br />As far as the writing, even the inside flap verbiage has so much redundancy that it becomes confusing and insulting to the reader.  For example, &#34;Few other environmental problems are as common or ubiquitous.&#34;  In this case, because common and ubiquitous mean the same thing, the reader is left pondering what subtle point the author was making with this complexity.  Better writers, or editors, would edit the copy more tightly.<br /><br />The author is mostly interested in visiting sites of oil spills, then relating travel stories about birds covered in oil that she has seen.  In her forward, she is more interested in thanking her husband for helping her navigate a beach with a broken ankle than she is in the craft of writing.  If you want pictures of the author standing in a salt marsh, or pictures of birds with oil on them, this is your book.<br /><br />What really ticked me off was when she said there are few human fatalities associated with the oil industry.  This is not true, representing an insult to the brave oil riggers.  While the author's job, college teacher, does not make the top 25 dangerous jobs, the task of oil rigging does.  Tell the friends, families and survivors of the Piper Alpha fire that over 160 fatalities in a hour's time was a small loss.<br /><br />As an engineer, I've been trained to address problems at their source, where possible.  For example, piloting the Valdez so as not to collide with rocks, maintaining a collision avoidance radar and associated reflector on the rocks.  The one half-paragraph on the spilling process in Prince William Sound was less adequate than reading Wikipedia.<br /><br />Again, if your interest is looking at pictures of birds covered in oil, this book will serve well.", "images": [], "asin": "0813523389", "parent_asin": "0813523389", "user_id": "AEL7ZM7RMHK6UHJ72JADXBK7FKJA", "timestamp": 1453177072000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I have skimmed the entire volume but am now looking forward to using it just as intended, once a day. Each single page devotional has a brief comment from the author and then quotes from one or more of the early &#34;reformers&#34; whose names we may or may not be familiar with.<br /><br />David Teems admits in his introduction that he has relied heavily on William Tyndale in his selections, perhaps not unusual given his previously published biography of this English theologian and martyr.

Definitely a recommended supplement to any Christian's daily Bible reading.<br /><br />IMPORTANT EDITING FOLLOW UP:<br /><br />I still appreciate the introduction this devotional guide provides to many of the &#34;Voices of the Reformation,&#34; but I have dropped my evaluation from four to three stars for one distinctive reason:  While there are lots of quotes from these historic writers and some good explanations of the comments, the author (or his editors) have not provided any clear guide to what is a quote from the Reformer and what is text added by the author. Italicized print is inconsistently used, sometimes for author notes, sometimes for the Reformer's own words. Quotation marks are mostly missing, so they are not a guide either.<br /><br />I am sad to see that there isn't more clarification here, as the overall content is really good.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Interesting idea, weak characterization, sloppy writing!", "text": "I read a lot of very negative reviews about this book but decided to pick it up anyway. That'll teach me! I have certainly read worse books than \"Starcrossed\" (*cough* Breaking Dawn *cough* ) but this one still does rank pretty high on my \"Wish I hadn't wasted time on this\" list.<br /><br />And, you know, the thing is that the basic idea of the story had potential. I could totally see this becoming an interesting story. Unfortunately, a good idea does not necessarily make a good book. It always depends on what the writer makes of the idea, and while I applaud Ms. Angelini for picking something other than vampires, angels or werewolves for her story, it has to be said that she isn't a great writer (yet).<br /><br />The first roughly 100 or so pages of \"Starcrossed\" were bad. Ridiculously, cringeworthy, eyeroll-inducingly bad. Nothing in those pages made sense, the characters were completely flat and all behaved very immature, and I did at some point wonder whether this book was written by a 12-year-old. And yet I kept reading because it was so bad it was actually entertaining. It was like driving by an accident --- you know you don't want to see it, but you can't stop yourself from looking, either.<br /><br />Anyway, it got better after that. Marginally. See, it seems that after those 100 or so pages Ms. Angelini finally remembered that characterization should actually be part of a book. Any book. So she tried to give her characters more depth --- which worked to a degree. I was able to relate to the characters a little more but they still did remain pretty one-dimensional throughout the entire book.<br /><br />The main protagonist in \"Starcrossed\" is a teenage girl named Helen Hamilton who lives with her father on the beautiful island of Nantucket. She's tall, blonde, and very beautiful.  Over the course of the beginning of the book we find out that Helen has quite a few abilities --- she's super strong and super fast, she has incredible hearing, she can fly, she can generate lightning ... oh, and did I mention that she can't be hurt by *any* weapon??? Really, it was just a *little* too much for my taste.<br /><br />Now with all those abilities you'd think Helen would be one tough, confident, kick-ass girl, but no --- she's actually weak and childish and full of insecurities.I didn't dislike her exactly, but I didn't really like her, either. In fact, half the time I just found her really annoying. She is also very accepting of anything and everything.  Whether it's the fact that she is stronger and faster than everybody she knows, or that she can fly, or that she is one of the Scions --- descendants of the mythological Greek gods --- she always simply accepts everything as reality without so much as the bat of an eyelash. There is barely a moment of disbelief or anything. Unfortunately it's like that for the entire book --- she almost  never questions anything that she is told or that happens to her!<br /><br />Helen is also a very impassive character. For example, when Cassandra tries to kill her because that's what she saw herself doing in one of her visions, all Helen thinks is that if Cassandra foresaw her death then there would be no point in fighting back or resisting anyway. So she does nothing. Really? Seriously? She just sits there while she waits for Cassandra to behead her with a sword? Any normal person would have panicked and run away or fought back ... or at least thought about running or fighting back. But Helen goes for \"sacrificial lamb\" instead.<br /><br />Then there's the male lead character --- Lucas Delos, a gorgeous boy who has just moved to the island with his family. The first time Helen sees Lucas she starts feeling uncontrollable hate, runs towards him and tries to throttle him or something like that. When she meets him again for the next time near his family's home she barrels right into him as soon as she sees him and they start fighting. Again, she never questions the instant hate she feels toward Lucas and the other members of the Delos family, or the \"Why\" behind the fact that she wants to kill him. Somewhere around page 100 or so they suddenly stop hating each other --- no real explanation for this is given by the author. I guess she expects her readers to be like Helen and just --- can you guess? --- accept it ...!<br /><br />Lucas and Helen are supposed to be these tragic starcrossed lovers, but really ... there was nothing in the book that made me think \"Oh yeah, those two are meant to be together ...\". They go from instant hate (at the beginning of the book) to instant attraction (a little later). There is no base or reason for their love, though. You know how some books have really beautiful love stories that make you smile and sigh and basically make your toes curl? This isn't one of them.<br /><br />And, you know, talk about sending mixed signals! After they get over their initial hatred for each other Lucas constantly holds Helen's hand or hugs her, he gives her smoldering glances ... there is one occasion where he lies with her IN HER BED (her under the covers, him on top ... sound familiar?), and he's holding her and kissing her neck ... but basically the moment she tries to touch him he says \"We can't\" ... while still nuzzling her neck, of course. In another situations she tells him that she's mad at him for leading him on (which he did) and then he gets mad at her for saying that ... Hello?<br /><br />Let's move on to Helen's best friend Claire --- her reaction when Helen tells her that she can fly (and do other stuff) is absolutely ridiculous! So we're supposed to believe that Claire has know about all of this for a good 10 years and never mentioned it to anyone -- even Helen herself? That a 7-year-old girl would push her best friend of a roof and try to cut her with a knife simply to prove her theories?<br /><br />The Delos family itself had a few mildly interesting characters but they did remind me a little too much of the Cullen family in \"Twilight\". Halfway through the book I realized that the character I liked best of everyone in this story was actually Lucas' psychotic cousin Hector. Well, he was really only psychotic in the beginning. But really, after a while I noticed that he was really the only one with a good head on his shoulders, the only one whose thoughts went in a reasonable direction.<br /><br />I hate it when YA paranormal romance books automatically get compared to \"Twilight\" but in this case there is really no avoiding it. Did Ms. Angelini get inspired (read: steal) from the \"Twilight\" series? You bet she did. There are too many parallels for it to be otherwise. She merely exchanged vampires and werewolves for Greek mythology and the descendants of Greek Gods.<br />________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Here are some examples of the writing and my thoughts while I was reading the book:<br /><br /> \"One of the terrible side effects of feeling as if she somehow already knew Lucas was that she was starting to idealize him, making him more perfect than was humanly possible.\" ... followed by ... \"Which was uncomfortable  because she also still wanted to kill him.\"<br />--- Why does she feel like she already knows him? And why does she want to kill him? She has only seem him twice and hasn't even talked to him yet!<br /><br />\"You just helped me, and I'm grateful. But I still really, really want to kill you.\" ... and then he says \"This is hard for me, too, you know\"<br />--- No, why should she know? They don't know each other at all, after all ...!<br /><br />\"Lucas was like her. The thought made her stomach heave. How could she be anything like someone she hated so desperately?\"<br />--- Ah, right. And how does she know she's like him again? For that matter, how does she know what he's like anyway?<br /><br />Imagine Lucas saying this *right* after he and Helen had been fighting to the death: \"Damn it. They can't find you here or you're dead. Go!\"<br />--- Wait, a moment ago he wanted to kill her, and now he wants her to run away so she *doesn't* get killed? Make up your mind, already ...<br /><br />\"The furies wanted her to kill Lucas, that was clear ...\"<br />--- Really? Why is that clear? And why isn't she the least bit bothered by the thought of killing someone she doesn't even know?<br /><br />\"Helen had no doubt he (Lucas) wanted to kill her ...\" and a little later \"An ancient, supernatural force ewas compelling her to kill Lucas.\"<br />--- And yet she never even asks herself why ... personally, I would have demanded quite a few answers from someone at some point ...<br /><br />\"If paper could cut her but a spear couldn't, could you make a spear out of paper and kill her?\"<br />--- Need I comment this one? A spear made out of paper ... right ...<br /><br />This coming from Helen after hovering in front of her best friend's bedroom window and thus \"coming out\" to her with her new ability: \"I just flew in your window. Why aren't you more surprised?\" ... followed by Claire saying \"I've known you could fly since we were kids. I even pushed you off your roof once to make sure.\"<br />--- Really? I don't even know what to say to that one ...<br />__________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Basically, I quickly lost track of how often I raised my eyebrows and asked myself \"But WHY???\" --- it happened a few times on every page!

But then the plot descended into political rants about this crooked guy running for President, and some skulduggery and kidnappings associated with that.

Scratch is open-source, fairly easy to get into if you (or your kids) have a little tenacity in downloading, installing and walking through the interface. It reminds me a little of javascript in the syntax though I've found my kids really like Blockly (and the related Star Wars games on code.org) better and find Blockly less frustrating than Scratch.<br /><br />The book itself uses pixel versions (and some screen grabs) from Star Wars properties to teach kids about Scratch. The games are roughly Star Wars _themed_ but aren't Star Wars based, per se. This won't teach you how to make the games on Code.org, despite that Kiki Prottsman (who wrote the foreword) was curriculum developer for Code.org until the end of August 2018. If that's enough to make you stop right here, then at least this has been an honest review.<br /><br />That said, some kids respond really well to Scratch and just having some familiar Star Wars characters nearby is enough to get them into it, and that's cool and this is a book for them. But I don't think this is something that your kids can just pick up and go with; they will need some help.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Chilling at times, boring at others", "text": "CW: misogyny, homophobia, & suicide<br /><br />I picked this up because the premise had me intrigued. I don't typically get too political when it comes to my blog because I don't read books that are heavy on politics, but it isn't a secret that I am pretty liberal. So reading the synopsis above had me hooked immediately and I knew I had to read this book.<br /><br />The only characters I really cared about were our main character, Jean, and her daughter Sonia. But  I don't think that's a bad thing because a lot of the characters aren't supposed to be super likeable, at least I don't believe so. Besides Sonia, Jean and her husband Patrick have three other kids, two twin boys that almost make no appearances, and an older son, Steven, who has been taught to be incredibly misogynistic and cruel to women, including his mother. I wanted to reach into the book and strangle Steven, he was so awful. Patrick drove me insane because of how complacent he was with everything. Working for the President, he tried to stop the movement of suppressing women's voices but he was too passive. I could see why Jean was frustrated with him all the time. I didn't care to much about any of the other characters because we didn't really get any chances to know them. And I super had no interest in the whole plot with Lorenzo.<br /><br />\"Think about waking up one morning and finding you don't have a voice in anything.\"<br /><br />The overall plot was scary and realistic. The gradual transition from the world we know to the dystopian world we see in Vox seemed to feel natural and probable. I don't think we are on the precipice of this being our reality but I do think that this future isn't as far off as I would like it. The absolute helplessness Jean feels when it comes to trying to teach her daughter vocabulary (with both of them only having 100 words each a day) is incredibly frustrating to read. This kind of dystopian story is so much scarier to me than my normal zombie or children fighting to death in an arena dystopians because this feels like something that isn't a sci-fi or fantasy story. It feels like a warning. It makes me even more ready to speak out and to vote for the changes I want to see in this world.<br /><br />The average woman speaks about 20,000 words a day. The thought of that being cut to 100 words a day and the punishment being pain and humiliation is haunting. The women are seen as housemaids, cooks, baby makers. They punish anyone in the LGBTQ+ community and women are basically not allowed to have dreams or careers that do not involve their families. Their money is wired into their husband's bank accounts. This is all super terrifying. The book briefly talks about intersectional feminism and how important it is to have even more support for women of color. There is a biracial couple and the woman talks about her fear of being taken away from her white husband. Jean's privilege of not having that extra fear of being treated poorly for her skin color on top of being female was a really good conversation.<br /><br />\"You can't protest what you don't see coming.\"<br /><br />However, there is a sudden hard genre shift. The tone gives you complete whiplash as the reader goes through a good half of the book where we are getting this story of what would happen in society if women lost their voices. Then because of a job offer Jean gets in return for her and her daughter being able to speak the genre goes into a very scientific and clinical storyline that I honestly had almost no interest in. I skimmed every time she was in the lab because otherwise I think I would have just DNFed it. And then, we go from this scientific tone to this action tone that seems to come out of no where. I think I would have not minded that if I hadn't lost so much interest earlier on. I think it really affected my enjoyment of the book and by the end I didn't care.<br /><br />I do think this is a good debut novel. It brings up a lot of interesting topics and discussions. Vox is a great book for a book club or a Women and Gender Studies or Feminism classes. Depending on what Christina Dalcher writes next I could see myself reading another book of hers. I found myself genuinely affected, whether I felt anger, fear, sadness, when it came to the topics and discussions mentioned in this story. It made me see things in ways I maybe hadn't considered. I felt the emotions [I assume] the author wanted me to feel and at times it was blinding.<br /><br />\"'There's a resistance?' The word sounds sweet as I say it.<br />'Honey, there's always a resistance.'\"<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who advocates for women's rights. If you liked The book/show of The Handmaid's Tale, this is definitely something to pick up. I may not loved this book as a whole but the parts I did love I really loved. Like I said, it made me want to speak up more about the things I believe in, and it definitely makes me even more motivated to keep being an activist for women's rights.", "images": [], "asin": "B079WQK537", "parent_asin": "B079WQK537", "user_id": "AENCGYYB2WNLUANIANB7IYQ6KD4Q", "timestamp": 1546287648194, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Depending on where we live in the world, it may be important to hold some or much of our wealth in alternative assets. This book is written with a political slant and does not cover in any detail of how much, when or where to acquire or sell highly illiquid alternative assets without paying large commissions. For example a pawn shop or gold store often takes a big slice off the top of every transaction. I recommend looking into a &#34;how to&#34; book on a specific physical asset class.

The grammar and editing reminded me of various self-published novels I've slogged through, and the story itself was formulaic and uninspired.<br /><br />Rather than focusing on subplots or character development, Delaney chose to preach to the children this book will be inflicted upon:  \"But we wanted Harry Potter, like the other children at school!\"<br />\"The other children are heathens who will burn in the pit for eternity, but here's a nice Christian alternative to those horrid books that entice youngsters into practicing witchcraft . . . look, only the bad people use magic, and the Godly heroes beat them with chains and keep them in a watery pit lined with salt where they're poked with pointy sticks to atone for their sins . . . just like Baby Jeezus wouldve wanted.\"<br />\"But I want to read about Hogwarts!  And Quiddich!\"<br />\"Looks like I need to beat the Devil outta you once again . . . go fetch me that belt.\"<br /><br />Very dogmatic tone.  The few times that Tom Ward is enticed into using magic for the greater good he is condemned by his mentor for \"doing evil\", even though nothing negative was done.  His other tutor is possessed by (and I quote) \"the Demon Drink\", and drinks to excess to teach young'uns lessons about the evils of wine.  Almost every female character in the book is either a witch or witchlike (EVIL) and the menfolk are hardworking, honest, and heroic -- with the exception of the \"press gang\" who represent the evil guvmint.<br /><br />The only two likable characters in this tedious lecture on \"morality\" were the \"evil\" Alice and the witch Grimalkin.  Everyone else seemed overly pious and judgemental, and the protagonist (no doubt representative of the impressionable reader) was ineffectual and easily misled.<br /><br />I've read childrens' and young adults' books before, but rarely one that I've had nothing positive to say about.  Like I said, Alice and Grimalkin were interesting characters, but they were made out to be the enemies - even though they showed nothing but kindness towards Tom, even to the point of risking their lives for him.  Evil because they were different, and didn't abide by the \"rules.\"<br /><br />2 stars -- I think that children who enjoyed the Harry Potter series should be made to read this poorly written diatribe to learn that, yes, there is evil in the world, and evil smallminded bigots who long for the chance to persecute those who believe differently from themselves.  Then, they should be encouraged to write a comparative essay showing the differences between the world of Harry Potter and this other world portrayed in \"Wrath of the Bloodeye\", particularly about how magic is viewed.

We come to learn their family dynamic over time. Miriam, the oldest, is the organized typical 'oldest child'. Clare, the middle girl, has always been different from the others, impetuous and combative, struggling with alcoholism in her adult life. Anna, the youngest girl is seen by the others as the 'princess', spoiled and the favorite. Then along comes Sebastian, and his relationship with his sisters is more as 'mothers' than 'siblings' because of the age difference. When Mom is on her deathbed, she calls Anna to her and tells her where her Will is. She tells Anna there is a letter with the will - and Anna is to find them and burn them both! So Mom dies and the family believes she left no Will. There are not jealousies or arguments among the kids over the estate, so Anna thinks all is fine. But, rather than burning the documents, she decides to read them. That's when she discovers her Mom's deep secret, and the possibility that Clare is the result of a brief affair. She tries to keep all this quiet, but secrets don't stay hidden. The rest of the book revolves around the sibling relationships, blow-ups and reconciliations. The plot had an interesting premise, but I didn't find the book compelling. In the end, I closed the book and thought, 'whatever...'", "images": [], "asin": "B07CKRG8TN", "parent_asin": "B07CKRG8TN", "user_id": "AEVIQXSGPZXVTPQJ6BNYGHHG3AIA", "timestamp": 1551049166891, "helpful_vote": 57, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not short stories, but an anthology of excerpts of novels and longer works; not what I had anticipated...", "text": "To call this a collection of &#34;stories&#34; is a bit of a misnomer: less than a third of the 27 pieces it contains were actually written to stand alone as independent stories (including one by the acknowledged master of the French short story, Guy de Maupassant.) The rest? Well, they are snippets of longer -- sometimes much, much longer works. Yes, they do give an overview of different aspects of Paris, although they seem to have been selected more carefully for their ability to span a wide range of literary styles and eras (authors range from Rabelais to James Baldwin; from Colette to Patrick Modiano; from classics like Balzac or Zola to the little- or less-known figures of Queneau and Perec.)<br /><br />Frankly, a lot is lost when you chop a piece of text out of a long novel and present it to the reader without its context, as an example of writing about Paris. Sure, it's about Paris, but you miss the other part of the equation: where the story stands on its own two legs as a great or good (or perhaps less impressive) literary work. I think you can get away with doing that a few times, but when it's two-thirds of an anthology??? Nope. Not when the theme is Paris, and when so many great stories have been written about/set there.<br /><br />What is here is good, admittedly (the butchery of longer works notwithstanding). You can't quibble with an excerpt from Hugo's &#34;Les Mis&eacute;rables&#34;, for instance. But what is missing also grated on me. Where, for instance, is anything by Marcel Proust? How, in the name of all that is great and good about writing about Paris, could one publish an anthology (especially one with so many excerpts from long works) and exclude his descriptions of the Bois de Boulogne, or the streets of Paris, or... well, any number of scenes in &#34;Remembrance of Things Past&#34; or however you want to translate the title of his epic work. And yet the editor has included an excerpt from &#34;Quartet&#34; by Jean Rhys. I confess I'm bemused. Where is a short story by Mavis Gallant, who lived and wrote about Paris for decades and whose wonderful short stories were published in the New Yorker? She'd be just as interesting -- in a different way -- as Julio Cortazar.<br /><br />If what you're looking for is just a series of snippets of longer works with a Parisian theme, well, these are high-quality snippets, if not always the most representative or the best on offer. I just don't happen to think much of this approach to building anthologies of &#34;stories&#34;, and despite the lovely editions, won't be seeking out any more of them.", "images": [], "asin": "1101907568", "parent_asin": "1101907568", "user_id": "AH4PHUQB5OQ4ALDY7RQVLIC67M7A", "timestamp": 1462418040000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Familiar Plot Line With A Quirky Twist", "text": "As I've learned from reading Ketkar's other book, Killing Matt Cooper (under a pen name), don't expect a typical and average storyline to be included, which is one of the things I liked about this book. Staged Fright is a suspense thriller about bioterrorism, with a splash of CSI and some quirkiness sprinkled in. All these parts combine to create a funny, entertaining read.<br /><br />As much of a serious topic as terrorism (biological or otherwise), considering the current climate, Ketkar manages to infuse some humor, wit and a little extra that you wouldn't find in other books with the same storyline. The story has a dramatic \"race against time\" vibe, but it stands apart with the variable cast of characters that are involved. They are the ones that add the fun in this book. The Callahan clan is not your typical affluent family. Larkin and Tigh are not your prototypical scientists (which you can say the same about their colleagues at the C.D.C). What I find interesting is that amongst the non-typical people in the book, Neil turns out to be most relatable character there is with his feelings of inadequacy and being an outcast (among his school and family). And I know Jack is a musical prodigy, but it was hard for me to take him seriously with him in his \"prison garb\" and acting thuggish.<br /><br />I appreciated the detail involved in explaining the science behind identifying biological elements and such. You can tell much time and work (whether through personal knowledge or research) was put into the explanation. However, it got to be a little much for me. It took me out of the flow of the story and made it a little hard for me to get through those passages. Maybe if it was a little more condensed, it may not have slowed down the story and kept my interest. But I do appreciate the detailed narration of those scenes.<br /><br />In the end, Staged Fright was a humorous, quirky, suspense thriller that made for a great read. Ketkar took a familiar plot line and made it into his own. The one thing you can count on from his books is that it's never going to be what you expected.", "images": [], "asin": "B00DSOG0QS", "parent_asin": "B00DSOG0QS", "user_id": "AHK4SVWZNWTMAQN3LKJOW7T2XJZA", "timestamp": 1375124834000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

After World War Z is over. It answers the eternal question of \"what happens next\".<br /><br />What happens next is a lot of medical paranoia. But rightly so, as a single zombie can infect a building full of people faster than you can say \"George Romero\". People live in tight-knitted communities, and can only enter buildings by continuous infection checks (virus-scanners, retina scans, cognitive tests).<br /><br />The other part of the story is about journalism. And not just any journalism -- blog journalism. See, when the zombies broke, the mass media dropped the ball because zombies are kid stuff. Meanwhile the Internet takes this s*** seriously, since most of them have zombie contingency plans, and rose up as legit because they didn't have any big business telling them what to report. A brother-sister news team goes out to follow a candidate's run for president. Along the way, they uncover a bad news bears conspiracy to assassinate said presidential hopeful, using biological weapons (guess which ones) that have some pretty horrible consequences.<br /><br />This a pretty good book, maybe the second best I read these two months.

Not just because the main characters are two high school girls, but just for the subject matter, the writing itself, etc.  This is not a story for adults!<br />2) it started out well, and kept my interest.  I was actually taken back to high school (in the early 70s) and my friendship with one girl.  We were also inseparable, like these two.  And like the father said, we got older, life happened and I have no idea where she went.  Then of course, the story changed.<br /><br />Would a teen really keep that sort of secret from her lawyer father, a father she is very close to?  I don't think so.  Would she really hide the \"evidence\" like she did?  I doubt it. That's where the story starts getting into \"bad fiction\" territory.<br /><br />Now, the ending...  this is a SPOILER...<br /><br />While Zipporah and her brother are out on the front porch, their parents decide (without a word to the brother, without asking him what he wants) they will raise their grandchild.  That mom will quit her job to do so.<br />This is what got me, dad saying to the son, \"What are you going to do about it?  Stop going to college?  Get a job to pay for diapers and bottles?\"  YES&lt; THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN!  If this young man wants his baby, he is the one responsible, not his parents.  They didn't even ask him if he wanted the baby, and there was no indication he did, in fact there was no way to tell how he felt, other than embarrassed at being caught. He was in college, Karen was 15.  Did anyone even consider the girl's mother would press charges and he would be in jail, not in college?<br />Instead of any \"learn your lesson here children,\" we get a girl who gets off free after misleading the police (oh, she bemoans her parents lack of trust, but I mean legally), a college student who gets a 15 year old girl pregnant, and his parents make it all okay for him.<br /><br />Not an ounce of responsibility shown in this book in any way.

It's a quick read that moves along nicely but has clunky transitions at times and what felt like a rushed patchwork ending. Some of the prose jumps out and elevates the story but then it downshifts to better-than-average. Still a good yarn but not something I'd ever feel the need to read again.<br /><br />Plotline/story: You do feel like you are in a seaside wharf, a whaling ship or other exotic locations though sometimes the author shares the minimum necessary details to put you there (like a TV show that shows a character in a tent in the desert with flies, sweat soaked clothes and a near empty canteen but never really shows the actual desert or surrounding areas). Still, some of the simpler scenes ring with authenticity so this author is one to watch - he just needs a better editor to drive for better plot structure, more realized characters and better executed twists. Even better, I'd love to see a Preston/Child-like collaboration with his partner to craft the story and characters and McGuire adding action, color and defining scenes.<br /><br />Characters: An odd mix of near-iconic and as if they were selected from central casting. The villain is very well written as a force of nature/evil but most of the other characters don't rise above TV trope land, including the main protagonist, whose tortured past is 'revealed' in a series of flashbacks (which is getting to be a tired crutch) and isn't worth the wait to find out.<br /><br />A great beach/plane read but will probably be available in Kindle Unlimited before too long.", "images": [], "asin": "B015MQA2W2", "parent_asin": "B015MQA2W2", "user_id": "AGW5XMMJEHDMHABA6CPBIPJN2ZGQ", "timestamp": 1484144884000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

In some cases it repeats the same text almost verbatim, Job's opinion of Obama, the discussions of open vs. closed systems and several others.<br /><br />Isaacson admits in several places that Jobs really did not learn or develop much as a person throughout this life, the changes that did happen as he became a father, etc. were subtle and even in the midst of a life changing illness when people thought he might change, it was just repeat the cycle above.<br /><br />That is a weak analysis of an undeniably rich life.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Studio 54:  the Roman Empire of NYC Nightlife", "text": "New York City and the 1970s:  a dysfunctional marriage that spawned a myriad of cultural icons; one of them being Studio 54.  With THE LAST PARTY, Anthony Haden-Guest details the \"perfect storm\" scenario that allowed Studio 54 to become the patriarch of the city's competitive social scene until it imploded ... a victim of owner self-indulgence and arrogance.  While the book's intention is to highlight the zeal of the nightclub scene in NYC from the disco era through the 80s, it is obvious that Studio 54 set the tone from the beginning and cast a shadow that loomed large, long after its demise.<br /><br />Hayden-Guest's journalistic perspective of New York's night life pays homage to the ingredients that made the magic:  the investors/owners/promoters that facilitated the venues, the celebrity culture that used these venues as their personal playgrounds and the wannabes that simply wanted a taste of the upscale life.  A roughly chronological journey that takes readers through the short-lived life-cycle of Studio 54 and many other clubs that dominated New York's nightlife, the book clearly defines a by-gone era.  Although numerous other clubs are detailed, none have the substantive clout that defined Studio 54 at its peak or the example it set when its owners were imprisoned for tax evasion.  Because of this, Studio 54 dominates the pages of the book.<br /><br />While I was expecting somewhat of a detailed historical overview of Studio 54 and its societal impact, I found the book more of a wistful remembrance of someone who experienced those days first-hand.  As a columnist/critic, Hayden-Guest had a front-row seat to the social scene back then and rubbed elbows with New York's social royalty (including the club owners).  THE LAST PARTY encapsulates the recollection of experiences from those who shared the rise and fall of Studio 54 and the club scene through the 70s and 80s.  Their voices, while offering veracity to the storyline, tend to merge and disrupt the book's reading flow.  But through it all, we get a fly-on-the-wall perspective that details the decadence of an era where fun was a nothing more careless behavior (drugs and sex) in a seedy environment.  There is plenty of celebrity coursing through the book as Studio 54 (and some of the lesser clubs) served as THE watering-hole for the day's social elite (Warhol, Halston, Grace Jones, Bianca/Mick Jagger and a myriad of designers, artists, models and musicians).  The book was written in the 90s, so many of the stories likely won't carry the shock value they surely had almost 20 years ago.  Still, it represents an interesting look at what was considered \"cutting-edge\" back in the 70s and 80s, when hardcore drug-use, sexual proclivities and AIDS were not \"mainstream\" issues.<br /><br />While I found THE LAST PARTY interesting, it never gave me that nostalgic kick that I expected ... in other words, I don't feel I missed-out on anything special by not experiencing Studio 54.  But I did enjoy the book's manner of peeking under the veil that covered the lurid, murky world of greed, violence, lust, intoxication and inhibition that defined New York nightlife back then.", "images": [], "asin": "0061723746", "parent_asin": "0061723746", "user_id": "AGNLRIXUGGGR4E47KQDGWOG6ZGMQ", "timestamp": 1365523661000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

On the plus side, there are many thoughts provoked along the way, mostly having to do with what 'existence' really does consist of, but the narrative is poorly served by elements that the author reveals in the afterword were recycled from earlier writings, along with his 'uplift' scenario.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Story spanning 60 years of family secrets, privilege, and a murder in South Carolina town", "text": "This work of historical fiction takes place in South Carolina during a sixty-year period (encompassing the 1920s through 1980s). Without warning, the time period weaves back and forth as the story unfolds. At the book's beginning, Judith and Olva are relaxing in their sunroom, enjoying the warmth. There is a sense of old age, and a kind of quiet, loving relationship between these two elderly woman. They share a long history together. Olva is thoughtful, speaks carefully, and is always offering to do things for Judith. It slowly becomes a revelation that Olva is a woman of color. A newspaper report that Judith Kratt's only brother Quincy was murdered at the age of 14 in 1929 is the first piece of information thrust at the reader. The book will take you on a journey from the past to the present to slowly unravel the mystery of who killed Quincy, and also to uncover family secrets.<br /><br />But as the book begins, Judith has decided that she wants to make an accounting of various valuables owned by the Kratt family. As each chapter ends, items are diligently listed that Judith has spoken about during those pages. When you get to the final chapter, the list will be long and complete. Judith's family home is very important to her, and these family heirlooms are treasures with stories to tell.<br /><br />Daddy Kratt ran a successful cotton gin business and eventually opened the Kratt Mercantile Company, a glittering, imposing multi-floored store that even had elevators. Judith was trusted to take inventory and on opening day she took endless store visitors on tours of the facility. However, Daddy Kratt was a ruthless businessman and an abusive, cold-hearted father. Son Quincy, all of 14 years old, would gather information on various people in the (fictional) town of Bound, South Carolina to use against them in order to curry favor with his father. These would serve to improve the Kratt family's business interests by blackmailing enemies. In 1989 we know that the store did not survive, so that is another story to tell.<br /><br />The book centers heavily on issues of race relations, the depressed state of a once thriving town, a disfunctional family, and closely held family secrets. The character of the murdered boy Quincy was so despicable that I was devoid of any sympathy, or even in much interest as to who killed him. Ditto for the father Daddy Kratt. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. The core relationship that appealed to me most was that of Judith and Olva, and the saving grace of these characters carried my middling interest to the book's conclusion.<br /><br />Thank you to the publisher SOURCEBOOKS Landmark for providing an advance reader copy via NetGalley.", "images": [], "asin": "1492678864", "parent_asin": "1492678864", "user_id": "AH2HZDRA725DTBJUOEL3LZTQ7SPQ", "timestamp": 1563076163709, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Author's perspective is disappointingly slanted to the hard left", "text": "I am a great fan of [[ASIN:0393059278 The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home, Revised and Updated Edition]], a book which Ms. Bauer wrote with her mother, Jessie Wise. Ms. Wise home-schooled this author and allowed her intellect to flourish. Unfortunately, she did not protect her from (or perhaps actively exposed her to) ugly, anti-freedom, anti-capitalistic ideas.<br /><br />Think I'm exaggerating? Well, check out these passages:<br /><br />Of [[ASIN:817224164X Mein Kampf]], she says that it's eerie to see Hitler's racist rants alongside other National Socialist goals that \"seem quite reasonable.\" Then she says, \"the twenty-first century may have rejected Hitler's doctrine of racial purity, but his techniques of propaganda are still much in use.\" Not by the federal government, of course, but by evil capitalists! \"They have been turned to the service of the market, rather than the nation-state.\" Nation-states don't engage in propaganda? Really?<br /><br />Of the [[ASIN:1438241569 The Communist Manifesto]], she says it's \"difficult to argue with\" Marx's description of how capitalism exploits workers \"in a world where every family restaurant cowers before the golden arches.\" She rejects his political program in favor a mixed-economy welfare state, though.<br /><br />Worst of all, she totally misses the point (or ignores it) of [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]]. To Bauer, Orwell's classic is not a condemnation of the state (which she slavishly adores), but of ... advertising! Can you believe this? \"Orwell's hell on earth didn't come about in 1984. But in his chilling, detailed version of a world where both mind and will can be manipulated by large and powerful institutions, he was decades ahead of the postmodernists and their condemnation of our advertisement-driven society.\"<br /><br />Speaking of 1984: The page count of this book is padded by entirely worthless summaries of the books covered. They don't just give you a feel for what the book is about -- they give away the entire story in less than a page. For example, the 1984 synopsis *SPOILER ALERT* tells you that O'Brien works for Big Brother, that Winston is captured, and that he eventually caves in the emotional climax and tells the state to put his lover Julia's head in with the rats instead of his own. She spills all of this! I was afraid to read the summaries of any of the books I hadn't read yet.<br /><br />This book is not entirely worthless. Some of the tips on how to get more out of your reading are quite good, and the book lists are good, too. Of course, they're chosen with a leftist/communist bent, but since leftist/communists dominate the culture, it's important for educated people to know what poison they purvey. But please, supplement your Galbraith with Murray Rothbard and your McPherson with some good revisionist Civil War history.<br /><br />In all honesty, you'd be much better off the check this one out from the library, copy down the book lists, and then read Mortimer Adler's [[ASIN:0671212095 How to Read a Book (A Touchstone Book)]] for the limited amount of good stuff contained in this book. It is very depressing to see that Ms. Wise-Bauer ended up with even worse, more perverse ideas about history and economics than those poor children who are subjected to statist programming at government indoctrination centers.", "images": [], "asin": "0393050947", "parent_asin": "0393050947", "user_id": "AEXZ7CPNURUSGAUKNKABV545DKKQ", "timestamp": 1219212547000, "helpful_vote": 70, "verified_purchase": true}

Kloos apparently hated it though, because he changed everything about it for the second installment.<br /><br />Did you like the protagonist and his upbeat attitude? That's gone. Did you like his girlfriend? She's in about 5 pages this time around. Did you like the job he was doing in the navy? He changed jobs. Did you like him fighting aliens? He only does that for about 5% of this new book. Did you like him fighting the Chinese and Russians? He only does that for about 10 pages this go around. Did you like his infrequent complaints about the inefficiency of the US government and the inequality present in society? What about the stupidity of his commanding officers? If you answered &#34;yes&#34; to those last two, well you're in luck because that's 95% of the content of Lines of Departure.<br /><br />Every single chapter, the protagonist complains about the military. Every single chapter, he complains about the government. He mentions, not once, not twice, but multiple times that he no longer believes in God and thinks the entire human race should be destroyed. Every single officer above the rank of 2nd lt is described as amoral and actively trying to hurt the soldiers under their command, for no reason. Every single politician in the USA is also actively evil for no reason. Every single poor person is mindlessly violent, again for no reason.<br /><br />As you might imagine, this gets a little repetative. It becomes even more so when the author gives us huge chunks of exposition more than once, as if he were combining parts of different drafts without excising the duplicate material. Also the author has a terminal lack of adjectives in his arsenal, and is forced to use the exact same ones for the same things over and over and over again. The armor and accompanying gear of a soldier is apparently called &#34;battle rattle&#34;. So when talking about it, he says things like &#34;i got my battle rattle together and then the sarge got his battle rattle together, and then the other guys in the squad walked over, making lots of noise with their battle rattle and we got in a tank that was kind of cramped because of our battle rattle taking up so much space&#34;. Its ridiculous, no attempt to substitute &#34;armor&#34; or &#34;gear&#34; or anything like that, just the same term over and over.<br /><br />Throw in a deus ex ending that makes very little sense and a pointless cliffhanger and I'm just bored to death with it.

The characters names are the same, but their lifestyles are different.  At least in the first couple of books, I have no idea if Tess Gerritsen will begin to meld the two in future installments.<br /><br />What begins with the assault on two nuns leaving one dead and one barely alive quickly devolves into corporate cover-up when a third woman ends up on Maura's autopsy table missing her face, hands and feet.<br /><br />What could leprosy have to do with the nuns in a cloistered convent and why is Maura's ex-husband suddenly back in her life.<br /><br />This twist makes up the prominent storyline in The Sinner.<br /><br />I did like this book even if it was overly familiar.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Mixed feelings", "text": "I really wanted to like this deck because I love winter and Yule, but I'm a little disappointed so far. The deck excels in presenting many aspects of yule. Where it falls short is the interpretation, both in the guidebook and visually. The poems are really disappointing -- just hard to read and uses incorrect English. The interpretation of some cards feel too similar. Might take time to find if that's good or bad, but it can be frustrating. The deck is overall a bit dark and heavy as well. I get more messages about pushing through and enduring the dark, harsh winter than about the beauty of the season, the holiday spirits or hopeful messages. (I haven't actually counted though.)<br /><br />The artwork and interpretations sometimes don't connect well. For example, the Family card speaks about traditions, but it doesn't come across in the card, which is an artwork of a couple and a baby out in the snow with a forest behind them. The same minimalist background and environment is also used for many cards, not giving a lot of clue to the card meaning.<br /><br />I wish the artwork was more dynamic and diverse, because some compositions look really similar. (See Ceremony, Remembering, and Gratitude). Some are done intentionally though, for example Crone and Father Christmas are simply close-up portraits, and the message is more about a figure or a character. Ethnic diversity is another thing, and as an Asian, I don't feel particularly included.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The first of a series", "text": "Fiona Griffiths, known as Fi, is a young woman in a Wales police department, a detective with good intuition and analytical skills. She is also harboring a dark past, which periodically clouds her sleep, emotional clarity, and her thoughts. Told in the first person, she states that her social skills are a bit off (but I don't see that, only that she tells us), and that she struggles mightily with a challenging mental illness, which is revealed in gradual doses.<br /><br />Fi is currently investigation a case involving the heinous murder of a woman and her young daughter. The bodies were found in a dicey part of town, where they were living, but the mother possessed a credit card of a wealthy businessman who died in a plane crash. Thrown in the mix are prostitutes, a dirty cop, and other typical tropes from the world of crime/police procedurals. Fi is also grappling with reaching out to others, opening up to new friendships and romance.<br /><br />As a crime thriller, this didn't keep me interested. The events were too expository, and only occurred through Fi's second-hand communication, but I didn't feel inside of the action, and, to be honest, the action that did happen was derivative of hundreds of other police thrillers. The events were banal, and had a shopworn feel to it. The pace also crawled. I never felt one compelling moment in the book. Moreover, Fi's predilection for talking to the dead, rather than stir my interest, came off as rather flat.<br /><br />What did keep me reading was Fi's voice, which was warm and intimate and sounded as if it were in the room with me. She enticed me at intervals to continue reading, if for no other reason than to learn more about her emotional history and breakdown. What I didn't believe was how she got a job in the police department as a detective! Perhaps Wales is more lax than the US, where psychological testing is mandatory for all incoming officers to the police academy.<br /><br />This is the first book in a series that will feature Fi Griffiths as the main character.

A lot of similarity to Stephen King's previous novels (this Constant Reader doesn't tire of that).  I enjoyed the result of the Kings collaboration.<br />Overall, a good story.<br /><br />HOWEVER, though I enjoy Marin Ireland as a narrator, and mostly chose to listen to this book because she narrated, Ms. Ireland's \"West Virginian\" accent is brutally inaccurate!!  As a native West Virginian, I need Marin and the Kings to know: NO ONE speaks in the hokey accent she used in her dialogue.  Several times, I came close to chucking the book, but I did plow on and came to realize, after listening to it and the following authors' interview completely, that Ireland isn't entirely at fault for her inept interpretation of the West Virginian accent (although, come on, Marin, you really must do a modicum of research on speech patterns/accents before you narrate books).  It is evident that the root problem for the terrible accent she uses is the authors' lack of research about Appalachia (pronounced App-ah-lah-cha, Steve and Owen).  This is revealed both in the writing of good portions of the dialogue and in the authors' interview.<br /><br />NOTE TO THE KINGS:  Wheeling, WV newscasters DO NOT mispronounce words by leaving out syllables, thus making them sound like uneducated rubes.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Conspiracy Theory for Jesus Doubters", "text": "In Brief: Acharya S presents evidence that the New-Testament story of Jesus closely parallels pagan mythology. She concludes that Jesus must be a myth made up by the early Christian church. She also documents the abuses that have resulted from this myth. She does a decent job of presenting her case, and her work is informative and mildly interesting.<br /><br />In Depth: Archarya S (also known as DM Murdoch) has written The Christ Conspiracy to demonstrate her case that Jesus never existed as a man. She writes that he was created out of many pagan myths and patterned from pagan gods like Osiris and Mithra. The people in his story are actually based on astrology rather than historical men and women. Acharya describes this theme in her own words (Page 405):<br /><br />&#34;...these priest-masons passionately attempted to keep &#34;the Architect's clock,&#34; wherever they went; thus, they built celestial &#34;computers&#34; worldwide, and they taught the celestial mythos so that the sacred knowledge would never be lost. So passionate were they, that they took enormous pains to preserve the mythos and sacred knowledge and to make it understandable; yet it has been ignored, disparaged and historicized in the most vulgar manner in order to allow powermongers to compete with each other. Thus, we are inheritors of not only the physical ruins of the global civilization but the spiritual wreck as well.&#34;<br /><br />In other words, the &#34;sacred knowledge&#34; of the ancients based in various symbols and mythical gods has been made into &#34;real history&#34; by creating a Christ who has been placed into history as a man who actually walked the earth. The purpose of this deception is the acquisition of power by greedy and evil people. Our civilization has suffered tremendous losses in many ways as a result of this hoax.<br /><br />As should be clear, Acharya not only sees a historical Jesus as wrong in a factual sense, but this story is wrong morally as well. Much of The Christ Conspiracy is a denunciation of the evils of Christianity. She talks a lot about the wars and persecutions instigated by Christianity and other religions.<br /><br />How has Acharya arrived at her conclusion that Jesus never lived? She never really clarifies her logic. She does include a lot of references to other writers many of whom wrote long ago about Jesus as a myth. I believe she is arguing that since the gospel story of Jesus is so similar to myths that became popular long before the time Jesus was supposed to have lived, then it cannot be possible that his life would coincidentally be so much like these myths. There's got to be more to it than mere coincidence. Jesus must be a god made up to resemble these older pagan gods. As such, he might be more appealing to people with pagan beliefs. And as a real guy, he stands out from the crowd of those other gods.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not so sure that I agree with this logic. Yes, Jesus could have been created easily enough, but it's also entirely possible that he was a real guy who was inspired by paganism and tried to live his life in a way that it might be similar to these myths. His followers might also have dressed up a real Jesus in these myths. After all, today we have people like Benny Hinn who supposedly perform miracles. They are real people.<br /><br />In any case, The Christ Conspiracy is a decent book. If you're a Christian it will surely challenge your faith. If you're an atheist it should give you more reasons to doubt that Jesus was God.<br /><br />You might also try books like Nailed by David Fitzgerald or Did Jesus Exist by Bart Ehrman", "images": [], "asin": "0932813747", "parent_asin": "0932813747", "user_id": "AGOFYFA6354JGAEMQB3Y3M5RCTQA", "timestamp": 1508807631967, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

When Lucy's son Ben is abducted while Elvis is babysitting, and soon a threat is made regarding Elvis' past exploits long ago in Viet Nam, it mars their relationship to say the least. When Lucy's ex-husband Richard gets involved, with his own \"security\" forces and apparently unlimited resources, things get hairy in the hunt for the bad guys and the hoped for return of the kid. Before long, Elvis calls his buddy Joe Pike to ask for his help, and the plot is on.<br /><br />Frankly, we were disappointed in this tale. Elvis was in no way his usual wise-cracking self, and some stream of consciousness segments throughout, including a long foreword and after-word, were confusing and somehow hardly relevant. We also did not care for the many scene changes and shifts from the point-of-view of many different characters, so that the same scenes were sometimes replayed several times from each character's vantage point. It was almost like Crais was trying harder to write a screen-play than a crime novel. We also thought the otherwise straight-line plot was almost over-the-top violent compared to other entries in the series.<br /><br />While we thought Crais was destined to be a new favorite, now we're not too sure, as so far we're not as endeared to Cole and Pike as we thought we would be, and this particular story was not exactly up our alley.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Alternate protagonist from a long ago favorite author not really that pleasing", "text": "As a young adult, and dominant in our post-college leisure reading, our favorite stories were undoubtedly the some four dozen Nero Wolfe stories by Rex Stout, written mostly from 1934 to 1975.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not her best Scarpetta effort", "text": "Loyal Patricia Cornwell readers will perhaps be somewhat disappointed in Black Notice, the 10th release in the Kay Scarpetta series, but will nevertheless purchase a copy and savor each page as if reading the last words of a great world leader. In other words, Cornwell is such a superior writer it is doubtful she could produce a bad read and, indeed, she hasn't yet.<br />Scarpetta is a bit more fragile here than we've seen her in the past, dealing with the death of her lover, Benton Wesley, a year after the fact. It seems she has lost touch with what is going on around her, and must now begin to regain control of her surroundings and her life. Faced with problems within her office, political powers that seek to end her career, and, of course, a killer on the loose, she is forced to come to terms with the past and move forward. This includes reliving much of her relationship with Benton, accepting that he is not still alive and living out some elaborate plan concocted by the FBI for whatever reason, and finding passion in the arms of a living male counterpart abroad.<br />Enter disappointment. The patience of Cornwell's lesbian followers are wearing thin with Benton Wesley. While Cornwell obviously agrees it is time to either put him to rest or bring him back to life, this should have been done some time ago, freeing Black Notice to be the book it could have been. In recovery, Scarpetta engages in sexual activity with a virtual stranger, which seems forced and out of character for our favorite heroine. Maybe we're just jealous, but Talley's introduction seems sudden and intrusive.<br />Lucy, Scarpetta's openly lesbian niece, plays only a small role in the novel, which adds to further disappointment. Surely lesbian readers would have to admit they secretly hope Lucy will be the main focus, or at least a larger one, in upcoming Scarpetta tales. In this book Lucy is still dealing with the monsters that drive her to emotionally dangerous places, while readers wait to see the monsters for what they are, and how she might prevail and overcome her self destructive tendencies. Maybe in the next book.<br />Marino is strong in this installment, as Cornwell brings his unique personality to the forefront and lets the friendship he shares with Scarpetta express itself with humor and an obvious deep caring for one another. Readers have watched Marino's life change over the years, and now he must deal with aging and his shifting importance in the world of law enforcement.<br />The plot of Black Notice lacks the believability of earlier Cornwell novels. Gone are the strong, realistic killers of the early days, having been replaced with dramatic, almost super human qualities. Cornwell seems to be steering clear of the more forensically technical aspects of Scarpetta's work, and does not share as many interesting, if somewhat gory, details that once provided readers with clues and insight into the mind of the killer. The characters' lives and personal quandaries surpass anything the killer may or may not do in this book.<br />With a writing style that is clearly Cornwell, and a cast of characters we have known too long to turn our backs on, Black Notice is a continuation of the Scarpetta saga, and one that is well worth suffering a few disappointments. After all, Cornwell would be hard-pressed to outdo herself, with Potter's Field and Point of Origin tough acts to follow. While perhaps not her best, Black Notice is still worth curling up with on a dark, rainy night.<br />Sherry Stinson...", "images": [], "asin": "0425175405", "parent_asin": "0425175405", "user_id": "AFIW2TRI74VKVYMAGRWB2MBUNLPQ", "timestamp": 1011576125000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Above Average 80's Romance Novel", "text": "This review is of \u201cForbidden Fires\u201d by Bobbi Smith.<br /><br />The book begins just after the end of the Civil War. On a steamboat sailing out of Tennessee are a group of Union soldiers, among them Jericho \u201cCoop\u201d Cooper and his long-time friend, Price Richardson, the hero of the book. They are on their way back home to Illinois and their shipping business. Tragedy strikes, however, when the ship they are on blows up, killing many and seriously injuring both men.<br /><br />Price is rescued from a tree by Lawrence Douglass and his granddaughter, Ellyn, the heroine of the book. Ellyn and Lawrence live at a formerly prosperous, now dilapidated, plantation, Riverwood, with Ellyn\u2019s mother, Constance, and Ellyn\u2019s younger sister, Charlotte. (Ellyn\u2019s father, Thomas, and brother, Tommy, both fought for the Confederacy and were killed during the war).<br /><br />When Ellyn tries to bring Price back to the main house to care for him, Constance refuses to let him in due to her venal hatred of Northerners. (What Constance REALLY hates is the loss of her cushy Southern lifestyle). Ellyn takes Price to a shack on the property to nurse him back to health, and in the process, they fall in love.<br /><br />When Constance finds out about Ellyn and Price, she tries to break them up. She succeeds, for a while. Later, Ellyn discovers she is pregnant with Price\u2019s baby and her \u201cfiance\u201d, Rod Clarke, returns from the war. (Ellyn and Rod were \u201caffianced\u201d as children, as the Douglass and Clarke plantations border each other. Ellyn no longer loves Rod-it\u2019s not sure she ever actually did-and refuses to marry him, as she\u2019s in love with Price). Rod later marries Constance instead.<br /><br />Price returns to Illinois, and finds out two things. One, Coop is alive and well, and two, his aunt, Rachel Kent, and her son, Price\u2019s cousin, Alex, have been living high on Price\u2019s money, thinking that he died in the war. What Price doesn\u2019t know is that Rachel and Alex-along with Price\u2019s ex-mistress, Mary Ann Montague-are partners in a conspiracy to kill him and take his money. The cabal decides to step up their efforts when they discover that Price is planning to marry Ellyn, who has left Tennessee to marry him.<br /><br />Two attempts are made to kill Price; neither succeed, but they do bring pain and heartache to both Ellyn and Price.<br /><br />Eventually, Price discovers the conspiracy and puts and end to it, and he and Ellyn marry and have their Happily Ever After.<br /><br />Upside: Ellyn and Price are fairly interesting, developed characters. Their love for each other is definitely sincere.<br /><br />I also appreciate a very underrated part of Mrs. Smith\u2019s writing: she lets readers know the motivations of her supporting characters and lets them speak in their own voices. More than a few authors don\u2019t do this, so I appreciate Mrs. Smith\u2019s allowing this to happen.<br /><br />Downside: I find that many of Mrs. Smith\u2019s books are stronger in the first half than in the second; this is the case with \u201cForbidden Fires\u201d. When the scene shifts from Tennessee to Illinois, the book becomes less interesting. This, in my view, is because Rachel, Alex and Mary Anne aren\u2019t as good foils for Ellyn and Price as Constance-and later Rod-were. I also didn\u2019t like the way Price foiled the conspiracy against him; the result was highly unsatisfying to me.<br /><br />Sex: Quite a few love scenes here, ranging from suggestive to very mildly erotic.<br /><br />Violence: As mentioned, the ship Price and Coop is on blows up. During an argument, Rod assaults Ellyn. Price is injured during a fire at his shipping business, and later, both he and Ellyn are shot. None of the injuries are life-threatening.<br /><br />Bottom Line: \u201cForbidden Fires\u201d has some elements of a 5 star book, but too many drawbacks for a rating of more than 3.5 stars.", "images": [], "asin": "0821712950", "parent_asin": "0821712950", "user_id": "AF57ERGRF5IBJURVL5SOCCEVU7IQ", "timestamp": 1533665116137, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "\"It'd been too long since he'd tasted human blood.\"", "text": "\"The Hunt\" is the second novel in Zoe Daniels' 'Year Of The Cat' trilogy involving Holly Callison's battle with her nature and her circumstances.  Warning though, you should not read this book before reading the first book in this series, however.<br /><br /> \"\"The Hunt\" starts out several months after the first book, Holly has now been totally isolated from her old friends, and is now trapped in a friendless clique with Alex Sarandon, his sister (Liala), and his four other companions.  Alex has also become even more possessive with Holly, stalking, manipulating, isolating, and attempting to control all of her movements and emotions.  And this continues to escalate during the first part of this novel, and he does all this while telling her that he loves and needs her.  Alex's controlling nature will become so bad that Holly will start lying for him, all while Alex feels the insecure need to CONSTANTLY remind Holly that she is his, and only his.<br /><br /> Unfortunately for both Alex and Holly, there are cracks appearing in their relationship.  Holly is lonely, Alex's clique really doesn't like her, and Alex, despite being tall, dark, and handsome, with charisma to kill for, and who is tops in everything that he strives for or to do, really treats Holly like a second-class person.  Alex continues on his path to being as big as an arrogant, manipulative creep as he can be, and on his birthday he shows his real side to Holly.<br /><br /> Holly was already beginning to draw away from Alex's jealous manipulations, but what happens on Alex's birthday really breaks the relationship, and from here on this novel becomes an anti-love affair between the two.  Although, if you had been catching the hints Daniels had been laying down since the first novel, that's what this relationship had always been.<br /><br /> Then the homicidal Alex decides that Holly has to cement their relationship with a bloody murder, and it's then that Holly realizes what a monster Alex really is.  Alex doesn't take what he considers betrayal well.  The whole point, made in the first novel, and which Alex pounds into Holly constantly, of his stalking and manipulations, is not just because he \"loves\" her, it is because he is in quest of \"The Amulet', a magical object that will grant him great power.  He needs the power of \"the seven\" to find it, and Holly is that seventh, and by hook or by crook he WILL get her to help him or else.  And so the manipulation, the abuse, the threats, and the murders and the attempted murders escalate.  This, unfortunately for the egotistical and spoiled Alex, only makes Holly even more determined to separate herself from him and his gang. Alex is however your typical spoiled rich kid who is clueless and uncaring, and who is going to get what he wants in the end in anyway he can.<br /><br /> One of my problems is that I just don't like bullies, and Alex is just your typical bully with too much money and too much power.  On the other hand, Holly's love, disillusionment, and eventual battle for her own independence is a positive growth in her development as a character; and it hurts every time the abusive Alex pulls some trick on her.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the complaints that I had about the characters in the first novel are still valid.  Most of the characters, including all of Alex's clique, are basically bland furniture; set pieces to move about as the author sees fit to just keep the plot moving.  On the other hand, Tishia Nakao, Holly's first and best friend, becomes more dimensional this time around.  Still, the rest are just shallow at best, and forgettable at worst.<br /><br /> This is a series that would have benefited from a multi-perspective viewpoint, and Daniels tries doing this by having us see somethings through Alex's eyes.  But, still, I would have loved to have seen some of this novel through Tishia's, or even Laila's viewpoint, as Daniels wastes a good opportunity by not developing \u00fcber-b**** Laila any more than she did.  And again, cats gather in PRIDES, not PACKS!<br /><br /> What didn't really work for me was the whole shapeshifter angle.  I just didn't buy into the idea that when somebody shifts into their were-panther mode they were able to shift their clothing; buttons, zippers, money in their pockets, shoes, etc. with them.  Sorry, this was just lame.  I also didn't buy that none of these high school kids had no bad habits.  They didn't drink, smoke, take drugs, swear, have sex, steal, etc.  I mean, the bad kids lie and murder, but, nobody else has any of these other bad habits, nor do they have any good habits, or interests, either.  They are stereotypically, blandly, EVIL.<br /><br /> Then there is that Holly is horrified by the hunting of a deer, but then finds it hard to justify her position on her attitude towards this.  The reasons that she gives make little sense, that is, unless you go back to the first novel where Holly had declared herself a vegetarian, something even the author of this novel seems to have forgotten.<br /><br /> In the end though, this series for young readers, in an age where young adult novels have become more gritty and more rooted in reality, is pretty generic that really only has the core story of the abusive and obsessive love then hate affair of Alex and Holly to recommend it.<br /><br /> For this site I have also reviewed these following books of interest:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0590348086 Abduction]] by Rodman Philbrick & Lynn Harnett.<br />[[ASIN:0439903424 Being]] by Kevin Brooks.<br />Cryptid Hunters #1:  [[ASIN:0439799236 Cryptid Hunters]] by Roland Smith.<br />Cryptid Hunters #2: [[ASIN:0545204690 Tentacles]] by Roland Smith.<br />[[ASIN:0689856652 Monster Island]] by Christopher Golden & Thomas E.

By adopting her characters, Jill Paton Walsh takes on the very difficult role of living up to Sayers' standard.  In moments, she almost reaches her inspiration.<br /><br />As a modern writer, she doesn't have the grace, tone and background of classically-educated Sayers and it shows.  Overall, the dialogue was a stretch, the writing uneven, and the historical context was not quite as strong as it could be.  There are a few points where the stars align and I almost believed I was reading Sayers again, but not often enough.  However, the story was fun and easy to read and that is a very redeeming quality.<br /><br />I'd recommend the original Sayers books to any reader.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Skip the core book and go right to the adventures", "text": "As someone who's been playing Call of Cthulhu since 3rd edition, I've found better rules systems for my Cthulhu Mythos games. Specifically, the percentile-based Basic Roleplaying System used in Call of Cthulhu is good for new players, and those only interested in the \"skill roll\" system of roleplaying. However, players desirous narrative storytelling, and GMs frustrated in having to fudge dice rolls so the players don't get themselves killed (again) or fail another clue roll (again) will prefer other \"new school\" systems, such as Trail of Cthulhu, or even the freebie Cthulhu Dice: The RPG, a one-page rules-light system I wrote. You can also use Savage Tales for Call of Cthulhu.<br /><br />Where the Call of Cthulhu RPG excels are the written adventures, such as Chaosium's Masks of Nyarlathotep and the Cubicle 7's Cthulhu Britannia: Shadows over Scotland. More importantly, Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu scenarios created a high standard that many third-parties have sought after and reached. These adventures aren't cheap, so I recommend the free Cthulhu Quick Start download from the Chaosium site, followed by asking a few questions on RPG forums for opinions, then seeing if a less expensive PDF is available. The Chaosium site also has free Cthulhu adventures to download.<br /><br />As of this writing, Chaosium has a 7th edition KickStarter ending June 29th.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Carries a Burden ... Sadly", "text": "Thank you in advance to the publisher; Revell (a division of Baker Books); for providing an advanced review copy through Library Thing. A positive review was not required in any way, nor was it requested. All words are my own.<br /><br />This is the second book I\u2019ve read by Davis Bunn, and sadly it might be my last.<br /><br />The first book I read, Unscripted, didn\u2019t seem to have much of a plot nor did it make sense to me. But, I figured it was probably me.<br /><br />After reading the blurb on this one, I was really excited and HAD to get it. In addition, the cover was a bit intriguing. So, I was VERY happy to win it on Library Thing. And, I always like to give authors a second (2nd) chance. I don\u2019t want to view one bad book and go \u201cno more\u201d. Thankfully this is a standalone read so I don\u2019t have to worry about having a book in a series that I don\u2019t want to complete.<br /><br />Right off, the character of Ethan grabbed me. A surfer, he is now dying, and has a lot of regrets, particularly surrounding his brother\u2019s unsolved murder. Ethan\u2019s former sister-in-law (Sonya) asks for his help. And, he is willing to help.<br /><br />There was SO much complexity to his character that was surprising. Right off, this starts as a tear-jerking story with so much promise. And, there were moments of great character development \u2013 Ethan is obvious, but Sonya, as well as Ethan\u2019s \u201calmost ex-wife\u201d Gina.<br /><br />After Ethan\u2019s present-day visit with Sonya, and his niece Delia \u2013 most of the story is told back some 25 years ago. Only Ethan does things much differently \u2013 the surfing competition, an investment, as well as digging into the reason for and trying to prevent his brother\u2019s murder. And, the motives seemingly tie into Sonya\u2019s company.<br /><br />A side note, despite the political climate, it is interesting that the writer chose a particular hotel/casino for Ethan\u2019s \u201cinvestment\u201d to begin. Of course the investment isn\u2019t to secure a future, but to pay for what Ethan needs to save his brother\u2019s life.<br /><br />What sounds like almost a suspense novel takes a sharp turn towards science fiction. This is not a \u201cfeel good\u201d, happily ever after read. There are a lot of twists and turns leading up to the \u201cbig reveal\u201d. And, what \u201ccould\u2019ve been\u201d seemed to languish in the end. The big reveal was a slight let-down. There was a lot of legal wrangling with some witnesses being asked \u201cleading\u201d questions.<br /><br />There were also a few \u201cterms\u201d used that were not quite right. U.S. Marshals are often called \u201cdeputies\u201d not officers.<br /><br />It started off a bit slow, kept my attention for a bit, then slowly waned. The ending and even the plot didn\u2019t seem to live up to what I was expecting from the blurb.<br /><br />The writing was solid, vivid, descriptive, and in some ways emotional. The chapters were short so that it was easy to keep moving along.<br />While no real plot holes, I was left asking \u201cwhy\u201d quite a lot during this read. Why was it so critical for Ethan to do this? Why did Sonya want Ethan\u2019s help? More importantly \u2026 why now at this point? Sonya\u2019s motives seemed mostly selfish by the beginning. Even the entire story seemed to center on something that just couldn\u2019t be touched. I kept trying to \u201cdig\u201d for the meaning.<br /><br />The science fiction aspect, science terms, and theories were a bit too far-fetched for me to truly enjoy this. And, there were seemingly no consequences for Ethan\u2019s \u201ctime-travel\u201d. In addition; the past characters of Sonya, Adrian (Ethan\u2019s brother), and Gina; all seemed to believe Ethan\u2019s story without even finding it suspicious. Even a minor character believes Ethan\u2019s story.<br /><br />Even after reading the book, I was wondering what the \u201cpoint\u201d of the story was. The title didn\u2019t seem to match what was going on.<br /><br />I\u2019m sure fans of the author and/or this type of read/genre will likely enjoy this far more than I did. And, I really tried to like it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Magic or Madness", "text": "A mother that drags her child from village to village running from an evil witch may not seem quite sane. That would be because she's not. Her child, Reason, the main character, seems to think her mother is perfectly ok even though she tried to kill herself twice. It really leads you to think that the evil witch grandmother can't be that bad. So when Reason is shipped off to live with the crazy witch, we assume the grandmother will turn out normal. Not quite. There is the cat with it's throat cut in the basement, and the numerous teeth in random places to be considered. I was enjoying the first half of the book where Reason explores the witch's house and befriends the next door neighbor, but everything changed when Reason goes through the back door into New York. The pace changed, and my interest waned. Reason is taken in by another 15 year old and they go around the town exploring for a few hundred pages. Then, evil grandfather enters the picture. Every adult in the book seems crazy and dangerous, and I don't see why the children made the choices that they did in the end. Finding out that the 15 year old gets pregnant in the next book doesn't seem to bother anyone, but it bothers me. In any other YA book parents would be going off the deep end at the barest hint of sex, but not with these books for some reason. Even without knowing that, this book disappointed me. It's not a fun tale of magic and evil grandmothers, it's a creepy tale of abductions, magic pimps, and crazy people.

Pace was extremely slow through the middle eighty percent of the novel ensuring only the most stubborn or committed would finish (I was one of the former).

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "TSTL . . . that's right I finally said it!", "text": "That's it! I can not in good conscious go on reading these books without stating that Shiarra is To Stupid To Live (AKA TSTL). From the first book I knew Shia was short a few brain cells, but I kept holding out. She had a lot of crazy stuff going on, and each book was a struggle. However, after having the leader of the White Hats, Royce (the vampire king of New York City), and so many other people say how clever, brave, and amazing she is I can't stand it any more. Over the course of these books, she's gone from dumb to . . . ugh, just plain annoying.<br /><br />This book was hard to swallow because for the majority of it I kept going why the hell is she killing people on a whim. She has NO solid proof that the Sunstriker pack did all the evil things she thinks. Sure one of them scratched her, but she goes from never wanting to kill, to gleefully doing it. Not only that but one of the characters that I've been absolutely obsessed with turned out to be a dud. Much like this book. It felt like stepping off the cliff of this series' development. She's basically being brainwashed, and the time when she's not being brainwashed she barely second guesses herself. For the majority of the book she doesn't even worry about poor Sarah, her best friend!<br /><br />Royce is still amazing, however I can not honestly see what he sees in Shiarra. In fact, here's a little what he has to say about her:<br /><br />\"True, you are neither terribly wise nor clever--but your valor is what sets you apart.\"<br /><br />For me that valor is the one good thing about her. Also, there still isn't enough here for me to believe that a guy like Royce would fall for someone like Shiarra. He basically idolizes Shiarra since she did not take advantage of him in the first book, turning him into a mindless slave. She showed him mercy, when for others he never did. Now that felt real. The immortal creature of power finding himself with the simple act of mercy.<br /><br />Even after Shiarra gives into Royce, she continually doubts him. She switches her mind too much. \"No Royce I need you, but I feel so ashamed.\" They had this amazing moment together, and she's still convinced that Royce is going to own her. That she'll be a mindless bonded blood slave. At this point I was practically throwing the book on the ground--if it hadn't been an eBook--over the fact that Royce has proved himself many times over. (And if the preview of the next book is any indication Shiarra's going to be hot and cold.) Her prejudices and fears are justified, but a lead who's strong enough to get over them should be strong enough to stick with her guns and not feel ashamed every other word.<br /><br />This book is the turning point for me, no longer can I ignore those glaring character nesciences that Shiarra has been stirring in me. The next book is either going to save face, or it's over. (Or at least I hope I'll have the power to turn away.) This series has been a confusing addiction. There's many things that I don't like about it, and Shiarra being one of them is just not good. At this point I think my main reason for going on is Royce. Haines is a good enough author to take a character I never truly liked and make him the reason this series captivates me.

He's been in and out of multiple foster homes and institutions. He is an outcast with few friends, has an interesting back story and connection with Mary Ann. I didn't really feel like his personality came through as very unique or memorable, just the fact that he had four other people living inside of him.<br /><br />Secondary characters: I first thought that Mary Ann and Aden would fall in love, but it was actually really refreshing that they just remained friends. Mary Ann has had everything in the past, a stark comparison to Aden. She didn't really make much of an impact with me, although the past with her mother turned into an interesting plot point.<br />Their love interests; Victoria, the vampire princess, and her werewolf-shape-shifter bodyguard, Riley, seemed entirely one dimensional. Both seemed attracted to and sought out Mary Ann and Aden for no apparent reason. The romance was not very convincing and the characters seemed very stereotypical.<br /><br />Writing style: Showalter's writing style was both fast paced and detailed when the situation required it. Nothing popped up that jolted me out of the story, and that's how I can often judge if the writing is awkward or badly written.<br /><br />Plot: The concept of this book really drew me in, but it turned more into werewolves, vampires, faeries and goblins more than the voices in Aden's head. The first half of the book was quite different from the mess of paranormal creatures that swooped in toward the end. The twists and turns were entertaining, but also slightly overwhelming.<br /><br />Best scene: The beginning scene in the graveyard where Aden fights off zombie corpses.<br /><br />Positives: Concept, fast paced action and writing, multiple story lines with two romances<br /><br />Negatives: Characters, ending, some of the plot points were lost on me.<br /><br />Ending: Slightly thrown together. The ends were somewhat tied up (leaving room for a sequel, of course), but there was no closure.<br /><br />Verdict: Fun and entertaining, but not anything with depth.

Baragon does not appear in this one and he is an underground creature, NOT a stomper(whatever that is)!<br />Godzilla vs. the Cosmic Monster:  &quot;A huge rodent creature... comes to the real Godzilla's aid when...&quot; he &quot; squares off against the antagonistic Angorus.&quot;  The &quot;rodent creature,&quot; King Seesar, helps G battle Mecha G at the film's close. Anguiras faces Mecha G early in the film and is defeated.<br />Rodan:  Rodan is referred to as a &quot;pterodactyl.&quot;  He is in fact a Pteranodan.<br />King Kong vs. Godzilla:  Stanley ends the review with, &quot;AKA King Kong vs. Prometheus and King Kong vs. Frankenstein.&quot;  These are alternate titles for the  project that eventually got made as KK vs G. This film was never released anywhere as either KK vs. Frankenstein or KK vs. Prometheus.<br />But, it doesn't stop at the G series.  Some examples:<br />Friday the 13th:  &quot; A blood-drenched psycho killer named Jason is knocking off his victims... at Camp Crystal Lake.&quot;  The killer in this film was Jason's mother.<br />Return of the Living Dead:  &quot;A malfunction frees a corpse and causes a toxic rain to fall on Resurrection Cemetary.&quot;  The malfunction awakens more than just one corpse(the split-dogs, butterflys) and the toxic rain is caused when Ernie cremates the remains of the medical school cadaver.<br />Exorcist III: Legion:  The film was not released under that title.  Legion is the title of the source novel.  &quot;...A serial killer nicknamed Gemini has possessed the body of incarcerated criminal Brad Dourif, who promises to escape to murder again.&quot;  The killer is not known as Gemini but as The Gemini Killer.  Brad Dourif plays James Venamon, who is the Gemini Killer.  He doesn't promise to escape but wants Lt. Kinderman to tell the press that he is the Gemini Killer, who was executed many years ago.

Several affluent Americans take extended vacations in Europe where they are confronted by a completely different European culture, thoughts, and concepts. This is, strictly, the stories purpose: to enhance the distinction between two cultures.<br /><br />Despite America being built on the immigration of Europeans, by the mid- to late-1800s Americas customs and policies in social circles had fluctuated wildly from a stricter mindset in Europe, for Henry James, specifically, Italy. Daisy Miller is dropped into these social circles with her blas\u00e9 mother and annoying, home-sick, younger brother. She discovers Mr. Winterborne who is quite stricken by her and attempts to find a balance to her boldness and his affections towards her. When Daisy travels to Rome, she finds a Mr. Giovanelli, an Italian, who adds to her reputation of being perhaps a loose woman.<br /><br />The peculiarities and remonstrance that Daisy experiences is not her favorite thing, as she insists on strictly being herself and not allowing a different culture to dictate her actions. And that's...really it for the story. Not the most invigorating material, but perhaps a good look at how Americans, and America in general, strove to buck the systems of others way back in the 1800s, too.", "images": [], "asin": "0486287734", "parent_asin": "0486287734", "user_id": "AGQ4JE3J3SN57GE46FVLTNL3YPVQ", "timestamp": 1651677635016, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Blame the others", "text": "This book is seen as the political and economical pillar of the modern Latin American left. As such, it becomes a must-read work for everyone interested in understanding the so-called 'intellectuals' of this side of the world, who mostly share Galeano's ideas. This line of thought is almost a prerequiste to be admitted into the 'illuminated elite' of these countries.<br /><br />The author's thesis, written at the beginning of the 70's, could be summarized as follows: \"We, Latin Americans, are good people. In fact, we are so good, that foreigners have come to our land to take advantange of our good hearts. We are nothing but victims. First, the Spaniards came for us and then, the rest of European powers and the U.S. extended their claws. In no way do we have any responsibility for our sad present. We are just part of a masterplan, created by the forces of evil so we cannot develop. We represent such a threat to these developed countries that they will not let us prosper unless we become comunists. \".<br />As funny as it may sound for any rational person, Galeano actually believes that El Salvador or Honduras, for example, represents a more serious threat to the leadership of the evil imperialsts than South Korea or Singapore (who have stolen thousands of jobs from rich powers). Europe and the US are obsessed with us because we can put their supremacy in jeopardy...<br />Clearly, this na\u00efve approach follows the classical latin tradition of blaming others instead of looking inwards. The author doesn't analyze why is it possible that countries like Australia or Canada, mainly raw materials exporters in the beginning as Latin American countries, have become so good in creating wealth, becoming benchmarks of human development. His model is Cuba, who probably has the same GDP now as when he wrote the book.<br /><br />Having said this, I do share with Galeano the description of the \"conquistadores\" who came to this lands. They were looking for easy money and then go back to Spain. They were not interested in settling here. Their aim was to go back and spend the gold in luxury. But these inherited values, which naturally explain the poor development of Latin America, play no role in Galeano's version of the story. He just wants to live in a system that allows him to be like a \"conquistador\", that is living in lazyness at the expense of others, and to achieve that, no other social system has proved to be better than socialism.", "images": [], "asin": "0853459916", "parent_asin": "0853459916", "user_id": "AHBYYSW5PVA3KZMVF2VXVZA4DU5A", "timestamp": 1311713505000, "helpful_vote": 18, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "So-so", "text": "This is the seventh adventure of British homicide detective Tom Thorne. In his 40's, Thorne is a plodder and a brooder, married to his job and at times a lone wolf. All very reminiscent of Ian Rankin's John Rebus, although several of Thorne's previous cases have touched on the macabre. And the author provides plenty of British flavor - landmarks, food & drink, sports and especially slang. All in all I have enjoyed the series, but was disappointed with Death Message, which starts with an interesting premise, but then proceeds in fits and starts, with more than a few lulls.<br /><br />The book opens with our hero managing his life on a pretty even keel - for Thorne at least - and meandering through a new romantic relationship. This all changes when he receives a picture of a dead body on his phone - sent anonymously. And what soon becomes evident is that said electronic image is of a murder victim - and just the first of \"several\" Thorne receives. The identity of the culprit - and his \"motive\" - is discovered by both Thorne and the reader about a third of the way through the book and our tale becomes a \"police procedural\", with Thorne attempting to apprehend his suspect and racing the clock before the next \"death message\".<br /><br />In and of itself this lack of a mystery is not a bad thing - John Sandford with his Prey series has been wildly successful using this format. As the story progresses a psychological drama unfolds concerning our hero, the murderer and a \"third party\" from Thorne's past - not a bad twist. Unfortunately for the reader of Death Message the \"hunt\" shares the stage with, and at times takes second billing to, Thorne's romantic life. Humanizing a protagonist is fine and even interesting, but here the phrase \"too much information\" applies. Thorne's constant wrestling with his \"independence demons\" became - at least to this reader - downright tiresome - both predictable and repetitive - and much to the detriment of an otherwise fairly creative story-line.<br /><br />A so-so addition to a fairly good series.", "images": [], "asin": "006143275X", "parent_asin": "006143275X", "user_id": "AFGEL7XKPUAHC4TE4DUYL4D5XLUQ", "timestamp": 1338913652000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Carver\u2019s novel &#34;Star Rigger\u2019s Way&#34; the flux is a mysterious dimension that ties all of space together, and which allows civilizations of all kinds, and from all star systems, to navigate the great distances of intergalactic space between the myriad of solar systems.<br /><br /> Gev Carlyle is a star-rigger, and a star-rigger is somebody who navigates starships through this dimension thus allowing civilizations to be in contact with each other.  However, his profession aside, Gev is on a journey of another type, and we are on it with him.  First he's removed from the spaceship &#34;Lady Brillig&#34; for not being able to fit in with, and work with, the other three star-riggers that are needed to run the &#34;Lady Brillig&#34;.  So, to hone his flux navigating skills he has joined the crew of the star-freighter &#34;Sedora&#34;.  The only trouble with this is that his bad luck continues as he\u2019s now shipwrecked in the flux.  Shipwrecked because of a stellar accident which has killed off the rest of the crew, leaving him ill-equipped to run and navigate the &#34;Sedora&#34; by his lonesome, as he needs another star-rigger to run the ship and get him home.<br /><br /> As Gev puzzles out his future he comes across a distress signal, and following it to its source, he finds another stranded starship in the flux and on it he finds the runaway, and suicidal, Cephean, who is of the catlike cynthians, and Cephean\u2019s semi-sentient attending fernlike riffmar, who function as the glorified feline\u2019s hands and servants.  Abandoning his damaged ship, Cephean decides to ship, and team-up with Gev, so that both can use each other to escape their shipwrecked status.<br /><br /> The only trouble is, and this will be no surprise to anybody, that neither is really compatible with each other.  But to escape their situation in the flux they have to learn to work together, and match their rigger imagery, so that they can maneuver to a civilized system.<br /><br /> And that is what the first quarter or so of this book is all about, as Carver takes his time to explain how the flux works, hell, he waits for a couple of chapters to do this, leaving his readers confused as what is going on.  As the two being's personalities clash, they have to learn how to get along and become partners to survive, which will be difficult as Gev and Cephean\u2019s personalities are both disparate, and similar, at the same time.<br /><br /> Since this part of the novel that is the only part that\u2019s described on the dust jacket, you would get the mistaken impression that this part is the whole novel, and it is not.  It's only the first quarter or so, and it will be no surprise to readers that Gev and Cephean succeed in finding some common ground, and that they find their way to Chaening's World which is &#34;Lady Brillig&#34;'s homeworld.  And now that they are there, Gev will find much disappointment as the \u201cLady Brillig\u201d is no more, and his friends, the other star-riggers have scattered to different parts of the stars.  And so the rest of the novel becomes a semi-detective story as Gev and Cephean move from planet to planet looking for some trace of the only family that Gev has ever really had.  And because Gev considers the other three star-riggers as his ersatz family, he can\u2019t rest until all three are found.<br /><br /> The main problem with this novel is that Gev is such a passive and depressive character to spend much time with.  He is written as an emotionally monotonically and low-key personality through-out the whole novel.  Gev seems to be unable to appreciate any of the good things that happen to him, or to relate to anybody he meets, including his finding a beautiful and successful woman, who wants nothing more than to love and be devoted to him.<br /><br /> Another problem is the Cynthian.  He\u2019s your clich\u00e9d cat hiding behind an anthropomorphic and alien form.  He's indifferent, passive, low-key, indecisive, and fussy.  It\u2019s also never explained how a cat species with non-prehensile paws could develop space travel.  I don't believe for a second that the riffmar could do all of the hard work of building the cynthian\u2019s spaceships.  But with Carver concentrating more on Gev than any of the other characters, none, including Cepheon ever come across as a fully-fleshed out character, as any and all attempts at developing them is filtered through the low-energied Gev.  So, eventually all of their characterizations go nowhere in the novel.<br /><br /> Carver tosses in a few action scenes, like space pirates, to spice things up, but they seem to come across as more of plot contrivances, there just to keep the thin plot moving more than anything else.<br /><br /> I wasn't bored, but the story, and the contrived hallucinogenic imagery of the flux, a dimension which is never really explained,  just kept failing to hold my attention in Carver\u2019s episodic novel.  &#34;Star Rigger's Way&#34; started off as a published novella, and it might have worked better that way, because even at its short length it is just a little too long.<br /><br /> I read the book club edition and I thought the cover well drawn, but not very good as far as being representative of this novel\u2019s story  Eventually, this novel would receive a sequel in 2000 called &#34;Eternity's End&#34;, which would detail the adventures of one of this novel's minor characters.<br /><br /> For this site I have read these other science fiction books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0765321734 Bone Dance: A Fantasy for Technophiles]] by Emma Bull.<br />[[ASIN:0385127847 Cowboy Heaven]] by Ron Goulart.<br />[[ASIN:0380899175 The Duchess of Kneedeep]] by Atanielle Annyn No\u00ebl.<br />[[ASIN:B0062CPTP6 The Flying Eyes]] by J.

While this is important, even essential to the point of understanding implementation of reward systems, it isn't exactly what is conveyed by the title.<br /><br />This book is also lacking in a comprehensive case study.  Step one looks at clarifying behaviors vs. emotions and looks at rewriting companies' mission statements.

Well, it took a long time for me to get my hands on book 2.  When I did I started reading it and realized I had no clue what was going on.  So I borrowed this book from the library again to refresh my memory.<br /><br />It starts out strong.  I liked this version of the fae and the world building.  I wasn't sure about McKenzie, as at times she seems strong and kick-ass, but other times she just doesn't seem to have much thought going on in her head.  Her continual escape attempts were one example.  The first couple made sense, but after it was clear that a quick escape wasn't going to work, she should have bidded her time and planned something out.  Instead, she kept just trying to rabbit every time everyone looked the other way, to increasingly painful consequences as everyone (most of whom weren't fond of her to begin with) got increasingly fed up with her.<br /><br />For a while I appreciated how she held firm to the Court side of things and didn't easily accept anything the Rebels told her.  It was refreshing to have a story where neither side is monstrously bad (though both side occasionally do bad things), so it was difficult to tell which side she should chose.  After a while it got frustrating as she flip-flopped her way through the book.  She did eventually pick a side for the war, but couldn't pick between the two love interests even at the end of the book.  She thinks she did, but it's clear she feels guilty about the choice, which means the love triangle will continue into book 2.  No thank you.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The extraordinary baseball factory: San Pedro de Macoris", "text": "This book examines the extraordinary story of the Dominican town of San Pedro de Macoris. Any baseball fan immediately recognizes the place--the home of far more baseball players than one could imagine from such a place.<br /><br />The book begins with a sense of the hardscrabble life of those living in this community. A hard life in the sugar cane fields or the mills processing sugar cane. As the sugar industry contracted, life became even harder. There was also racism, given that people from many countries from across the Caribbean came here to work in the sugar industry when it was still booming. The Dominican Republic itself was the home for many major league players, such as Juan Marichal. Still, the number of players coming from this town is striking.<br /><br />The heart of this story, though, is one avenue that--by 2008--79 men had taken to escape the hardships. Major league baseball. Why did so many make it? As Jose Cano said (Page 222): \"Because we don't have anything else here and we weren't tall enough to play basketball.\"<br /><br />One of the most remarkable things about this book is the delineation of those major league players coming from this town. In 1962, the first players hit the big leagues--Amado Samuel and Manny Jiminez. Who are some of the better known players? Rico Carty, Joaquin Andujar, Alfredo Griffon, Pedro Guerrero, George Bell, Julio Franco, Tony Fernandez, Sammy Sosa, Luis Castillo, Alfonso Soriano, and Robinson Cano, among others.<br /><br />There are many interesting vignettes about many of these players. For instance, George Bell's volatility is discussed.<br /><br />The book is functionally written and explores an interesting story.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Beyond the Deepwoods", "text": "I stumbled upon the first two books in The Edge Chronicles when looking for another set of audiobooks to listen to. After listening to both books, I must say that I enjoyed the second book, Stormchaser much better.<br /><br />Beyond the Deepwoods is a fast paced story about a young boy named Twig that grew up with a family of woodtrolls in the Deepwoods. When he leaves his home, he strays from the path and encounters a variety of creatures living in the Deepwoods. Some help him on his journey and others try to kill or eat him. Along the journey, Twig barely avoids being eaten and is forced to watch his friends being eaten alive. These dark elements may be too much for the young readers to handle.<br /><br />Listening to the story, I kept thinking that it was very rushed and that Twig was too passive. He just went along with whatever was happening including being kept as a pet or living with a Banderbear. It felt like a story about a boy who didn't belong with any of the creatures he encountered.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Twig finally meets his real father and has a new home. He is Twig, son of Cloud Wolf (Quintinius Verginix) the Sky Pirate and captain of the Stormchaser. He too would grow up and become a Sky Pirate and captain of his own sky ship.<br /><br />Although the second book, Stormchaser continues the story, in many ways it could be a good starting point for anyone wanting to get into the story.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "More Fact Than Fiction", "text": "To be honest, the best part of this book was the historical note in the back. As a writer, I LOVED reading all about Gire's research methods, the information he used, and how he interpreted what he found. The note he included about Mary Magdalene was especially good, since most people (authors and otherwise) portray her in different ways and don't tell you how they came to the deduction that she probably was like that (i.e., a prostitute or one of the sinful women mentioned in the Gospels).<br /><br />Apart from the historical note and the author's factual representation of Ancient Rome and life as a soldier, there wasn't much that kept my attention. Like most Biblical fiction, there was a lot of head-hopping and moments of confusion concerning the POV. It was obviously written in a most omniscient point-of-view than from a particular character's perspective, even though Gire said it was written entirely from the perspective of his main character Lucius.<br /><br />I missed getting into Lucius's head and heart because of this, which really made the story less poignant than it should have been. As the centurion there at the crucifixion, I'd hoped he would have a more dramatic, emotional reaction to what he saw. Maybe it was more realistic that he didn't, but I missed all of his thoughts and emotions concerning Jesus's death and resurrection. There really was no conviction or conversion scene like I would've wanted.<br /><br />Also, the \"romance\" was way over-hyped. Without any depth to Lucius or emotion on anyone's part, any semblance of romance Gire tried to incorporate fizzled out.<br /><br />Long story short, the historical aspects were great. But the prose was lifeless, the story more fact than fiction, the characters more bland than alive. As a historical novel, I think it was fine--but it was neither romantic nor poignant at all, which is very disappointing for a story about the centurion at the crucifixion.", "images": [], "asin": "080240894X", "parent_asin": "080240894X", "user_id": "AEUSDP65VCFMFATYJPSOAFZJDOFQ", "timestamp": 1611253578914, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Readers who are not critical thinkers will enjoy this book", "text": "XXXXX<br /><br />I bet you didn't know these facts:<br /><br />(1) \"Men use about seven thousand words per day.  Women use about twenty-thousand.\"<br />(2) \"Girls arrive already wired as girls, and boys arrive already wired as boys.\"<br />(3) \"Men are on average twenty times more aggressive than women.\"<br />(4) \"Girls are motivated--on a molecular and neurological level--to ease and prevent social conflict.\"<br />(5) \"85% of twenty- to thirty-year-old males think about sex every fifty-two seconds and women think about it once a day--up to three or four times on fertile days.\"<br />(6) \"Men pick up the subtle signs of sadness in a female face only 40 percent of the time, whereas women can pick up these signs 90 percent of the time.\"<br />(7) \"65 percent of divorces after the age of fifty are initiated by women.\"<br /><br />These seven facts are some of the interesting information that you'll learn in this book by Louann Brizendine M.D., a neuropsychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and founder of the Women's and Teen Girls' Mood and Hormone Clinic.<br /><br />The thesis of this book is that the female brain sees the world differently and reacts differently than the male brain in every stage of life from newborn to old age.  A women's behavior is radically different from that of a man due to mainly hormonal differences.  This book is quite easy to read and, in fact, reads like a novel.<br /><br />However, I found the book to have minimal neuroscience (as suggested by the book's title).  It was comprised mainly of anecdotes (some autobiographical) that exaggerate the differences between women and men thus reinforcing gender stereotypes.  As well, I found many contradictions throughout.  In places of her book, Brizendine is also surprisingly na\u00efve.<br /><br />When I was reading this book, what struck me was the exactness of some of the facts the author presents (such as the seven presented above).  So I decided to search on the Internet for other reviews of this book from mainly scholarly sources.  The avalanche of negative information I found was astounding!!<br /><br />A major problem concerned her extensive endnotes.<br /><br />From reading this mass of negative information, it seems to me that Brizendine is attempting to present an authoritative voice to impress despite what the authors say in her numerous endnotes.  That is, her supporting citations don't support her claims.  If you couple this with Brizendine's impressive academic credentials (highlighted especially in the book's acknowledgements section and inside back flap), then most people, unfortunately, accept everything she says at face value.  (By the way, the seven \"facts\" above are not supported by Brizendine's citations.)<br /><br />I was intrigued by this so I checked out Brizendine's brief biography on the book's inside back flap.  A piece of information that intrigued me states that \"She has written in professional texts and journals.\"  What I wanted to know was how many professional research papers she has written in.  Again from searching on the Internet I found she had written exactly 7 research papers in collaboration with others and she's not the first named author in any of the seven.  (To put this in context, her colleague in the Psychiatry Department at UCSF, Associate Professor Steven P. Hamilton has published 24 papers since 1994 and is first listed author on 11.)<br /><br />For a \"pioneering neuropsychiatrist,\" (honest, this is what it says on the book's inside front flap) she has a poor research paper publication rate.<br /><br />At the beginning of her endnotes and references section, she states in a preamble the following:<br /><br />\"I have gathered the work of many scientists in various disciplines in order to arrive at this understanding of the female brain.\"<br /><br />From my understanding of this quotation, she used only the work of only scientists to establish her claims.  However, in her references are works authored by Allen Pease and Allan Garner.  These people are not scientists!!<br /><br />Also, in this preamble she calls everything she has written in her book a \"theory\" (a collection of  general principles that is put forward as an explanation for a set of known facts and empirical findings).  I found her theory to be quite rigid since she doesn't allow for or explain any exceptions (there are many) and this undermines her entire theory.  Yes, men and woman's brains are different but within each gender, you'll find a wide range of behavior.  To ignore this fact as Brizendine does is to present a very narrow view of human experience.<br /><br />I have to agree with an October 2006 article in the publication \"Nature\" that was entitled \"Psychoneuroindoctrinology\" (a pun on the word pyschoneuroendrocrinology) which states that this book \"fails to meet even the most basic standards of accuracy and balance,\" \"is riddled with scientific errors,\" and \"is misleading about the processes of brain development, the neuroendocrine system, and the nature of sex differences in general.\"<br /><br />Finally, I should explain my rating for this book.  The majority of those who are not critical thinkers will probably give this book 5 stars.  The majority of those who ARE critical thinkers will probably give this book 1 star.  My rating is the average of these two extremes.<br /><br />In conclusion, those readers who are not critical thinkers will probably thoroughly enjoy this book.  Critical thinking readers will probably have the opposite response!!<br /><br />{first published 2006;  acknowledgements;  the female brain (a human brain diagram with captions);  cast of neuro-hormone characters (list of hormones with descriptions that affect a woman's brain);  phases of a female's life (chart);  introduction;  seven chapters;  epilogue;  main narrative 165 pages;  3 appendices;  notes;  references;  index}<br /><br />XXXXX", "images": [], "asin": "0767920090", "parent_asin": "0767920090", "user_id": "AFBD2EAYRHPQAUQAPPB3C6GAVX3Q", "timestamp": 1181832951000, "helpful_vote": 189, "verified_purchase": false}

But then something happens to make him question everything he thought before. He stopped doing anything besides existing until his best friend drags him out of the house and to a party..... Where he finally meets a guy whom he falls hard for. It looks like things are starting to look up for him!<br />  Although the romance was what I looked forward to, it wasn't there for most of the book. It gave it a slow burn and made it so that even the reader knows how the tough outre shell was coming off Quinn. It was nice to see the way they fell together.<br />  What really captured my attention was the diversity. I loved that it seemed so natural and wasn't filled with stereotypes that some books have. It helped it to lean heavily on the realistic side and not so much the fiction. It refreshing to not have to roll my eyes with every page turn.<br />  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the plot. It was a little slow moving for my taste, but it helped to binge read it instead of breaking it into parts. There were times when I really fell into the story, but for the most part there wasn't really anything happening and it was a bunch of backstory.<br />  This book was filled with different thigns that I love so there was no surprise that I would like the overall book. I can definitely see myself reading more of Federle's books!", "images": [], "asin": "1481404091", "parent_asin": "1481404091", "user_id": "AHL7GFZXX7E3WMQXFZZXTXYGD5FA", "timestamp": 1483925439000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Mixed Feelings About This One", "text": "&lt;Spoiler Alert - Plot elements may be discussed> I am really still grappling with my thoughts on this book, which tells me I wasn't head-over-heels thrilled with it. Firstly, having grown up in the generation that was raised with the likes of Godzilla, King Kong, and all the 1950's movies with giant fauna of all sorts, I am a sucker for a good monster story. Secondly, as a big fan of Mr Robinson's previous works, especially the Chess Team novels which also deal with monstrous creations, I was eagerly anticipating this \"Kaiju\" thriller. I think because Mr Robinson's previous works were so good that I am a bit disappointed in Nemesis. Don't misunderstand - it is still a good read, but not on the same level as his Chess Team novels. The story has an interesting angle in how the giant creature comes to pass, and leaves open the door for sequels. There is a great deal of action, and the pace never bogs down with pseudo-science explanations. All the usual suspects are here as well: an affable and goofy hero trying to be the hero; a tough-as-nails babe cop who mysteriously is attracted to the bumbling hero; the geeky office trolls; and of course, the government bureaucrats who know best how to do things rather than the guys in the field. The thing which has me conflicted was the alternating first-person and third-person perspectives. My personal preference has always been for third person omnipotent, because when reading, we all tend to identify with a character or the hero. If the first-person character is a fool, then it is a less pleasurable ride. The hero in Nemesis can't make up his mind if he is an immature slacker or a no-holds barred hero. Some of his musings are supposed to be humorous, I'm sure, but tend to be just a peep show into an immature, and often crude, mind. The third person sections were far superior, and more in line with Mr Robinson's other excellent writings. In spite of all this, it was still a good read, just not his best work. I would look forward to more of the \"Kaiju\" story line if the first person perspective were dropped, and the hero grew up some.", "images": [], "asin": "0988672510", "parent_asin": "0988672510", "user_id": "AHBLTFMER4HXDGD5N6NQ7X5FNSXA", "timestamp": 1359048231000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good for a first novel", "text": "It's an entertaining book. How you react to it will depend on what you care about most in a book/series.<br /><br />The world is somewhat interesting. The book is a fairly standard example of \"we are the people who deal with things that go bump in the night\", but the creatures (\"predators\") are at least nicely described. I would have liked to see more details here. It would have been no trouble to cut a lot from the later, overlong parts of the book to make room to describe the predators, and make them more visible.<br /><br />The protagonist and his boss travel around fighting evil - although his boss is clearly on the border between ruthless and evil herself. There is enough backstory that the characters seemed like they existed before this story starts, which makes it feel more \"real\". Some more interaction with the other members of \"twenty palaces\" would have help set the stage a little better, though.  Why Twenty? What Palaces? Why someone would name a series after something completely absent from the book is slightly mystifying. There's only the protagonist and his boss in the whole story, from the organization side.<br /><br />Where the story falls down though, is two areas. The first is plausibility (I know, an odd thing to say about a story of werewolves and demons). But many things just don't really make sense - like the fact that these representatives of powerful wizards (who have lawyers, with pull in the mundane world) drive a crappy van and have no support. If you can afford lawyers, you can afford mercenaries. Or the fact that our hero runs around solo most of the time, leaving the more powerful, and potentially much more interesting boss offstage. Or just the implausible \"the boss wants to kill him, but her bosses insist she a) not kill him, and b) work with him\". Yeah, there's good management.<br /><br />There are a lot of times when it looks like the writer is just selecting implausible choices because they make the plot twist the way he wants it to. As long as you don't think about it, it's fine. I kept getting bumped out of the story and thinking \"does that make sense\"? And it doesn't.<br /><br />The second is the slow pace of the second half of the book. Once you've figured out who the villain is, and what he's up to, you should be getting near the end of the book. This book could have been a hundred pages shorter, without losing anything significant. I'd also liked to have seem much more of the villain. As it was, the villain was totally generic, with almost no personality (or even stage time).<br /><br />The comparisons with Jim Butcher are reasonable - but it's more in the same genre, it's not a Dresden clone. It's darker, and the characters more messed up. It's not as good as Butcher is now, but neither was Butcher's first book.<br /><br />It kept me entertained for a few hours, and I have high hopes that the obvious flaws will get corrected in later books in the series. I'll buy the next one, because I think they will get better, and the things he got right give the series a good base to build from.", "images": [], "asin": "0345508890", "parent_asin": "0345508890", "user_id": "AHSPVVKIYJCR5RHEIHO6VVS66ONQ", "timestamp": 1274003685000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Thus, 3 stars- you might love it, you might not; matter of personal preference.<br /><br />It is obvious the author is not afraid of controversy, covering topics like adoption, child custody, race, abortion, surrogacy, parenting, and socioeconomic differences all in one story. So this review will probably be all over the place in representation of my thoughts and feelings!<br /><br />The book starts with the Richardson\u2019s house burning down and the family suspecting the youngest, \u2018troublesome,\u2019 seemingly missing child, Izzy, was responsible. So I thought the story would be centered around that event and finding Izzy, etc. But that didn\u2019t come back up until the very very end. And really the story was more about the Richardson\u2019s tenant, Mia, and Mrs. Richardson, than Izzy, though her and the other characters have their moments.<br /><br />There is a lot of focus on Mia and I felt the author painted her as the \u2018hero\u2019 of the story, almost saint-like. She was the stereotypical free-spirit artist who was not \u2018bound\u2019 by social boxes of expectation but lived a nomadic lifestyle, doing whatever it took to be able to focus on and create her super profound and brilliant art that \u2018unelightened\u2019 people just didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m an art major, and maybe I just chose the wrong field and don\u2019t have the true artist spirit, but I find this character tired and annoying. She is depicted as if she is the only person willing to think for herself or push against the status quo. That she is on a whole new level of enlightenment and all the other characters would do well to be more like her and glean from her infinite wisdom. That any choice she makes or has made was right and pure. And that\u2019s just bogus. Of course she\u2019s not the opposite of all of that, but she sure isn\u2019t the blueprint for all that is good.<br /><br />And because of the author\u2019s depiction of Mia and because she clearly chose a side to her friend\u2019s custody battle (even instigating it), it leads one to believe the author was writing from a biased opinion.<br /><br />In contrast to Mia, the adopting mother was portrayed as a rich, white, ignorant, and basically subconscious racist woman who was only adopting out of selfishness and the desire for a \u2018perfect\u2019 home in her \u2018perfect\u2019 neighborhood. I found this off-putting. Of all the people the author could have chosen to represent this mother, she chose this on purpose, and I believe, to make a statement, one of which rubs me the wrong way. While she did touch on the mother\u2019s anguish of experiencing many miscarriages and the struggle to get pregnant unsuccessfully and the previous adoptions that fell through, the dialogue the author chose to use during the trial at the end was far from compassionate and understanding. I realize there are really people out there like this, but I found it in bad taste that she would choose to write this story the way she did.<br /><br />Here\u2019s the gist: The McCullough\u2019s have tried for years and years to have a baby, naturally and through adoption. And nothing has worked. Finally they are almost finished adopting an American-Chinese baby when Mia realizes it\u2019s the baby her friend, Bebe, left at a fire station a year ago because she did not have the means to care for her and lets her know. Well now Bebe has a waitressing job and decides she wants her daughter back. She believes the McCullough\u2019s have no right to adopt her baby. The author even writes Izzy to constantly call the McCullough\u2019s and her lawyer dad who is representing them- \u2018baby-stealers.\u2019 Like I said, no easy answer by any means, but this is a far cry from baby-stealing. And what\u2019s played up is the idea of race and culture. The trial dialogue that is presented when Mrs. McCullough is on the stand is basically- \u2018What do you plan to do to teach the baby about her birth culture?... Wait, you\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t speak any dialect of Chinese, you have no Asian dolls, no books about Asian characters, and you think just feeding her Chinese food and buying her a panda stuffed animal and take her on a rich person\u2019s tour of China will be enough?? You are an unfit mother!!!\u2019 Everything else they can provide for her and the fact that they\u2019ve already had her for months and love her and have cared for her after she was malnourished  and left on the steps is thrown out the window. I totally understand that there is value in knowing your birth culture but if that is what gives you worth and identity as a person, then there are a lot of people out there that will never live fulfilled lives. Can a custody case really come down to who can teach the baby the most about her birth culture, let alone in that very moment? Obviously the birth mother is still her biological mother who loves the baby as well, so it\u2019s not an open and shut case about who should mother the child, I was just disappointed with the way the author chose to write about it and the characters.<br /><br />Add to that the way the author ended the book and it\u2019s hard not to see a particular narrative the author was trying to persuade readers to believe.<br /><br />Another comment on the writing of the book- I didn\u2019t like the voice of the narrator, constantly giving background info on a character that the character whose POV you were reading from would have no knowledge of like \u2018[insert three chapters describing Mia\u2019s past] of course Mrs. Richardson would only find out part of this\u2019 or talking about irrelevant future information like \u2018Mia wouldn\u2019t know this yet but two years from now she would look back and think...\u2019 That voice mixed with a variety of POVs throughout the book was a little obnoxious.<br /><br />Probably an excessively long review but I cannot be more concise with my feelings at the moment.<br /><br />The controversial topics and situations will challenge your thinking, depending on your worldview, and will cause a variety of feelings. And honestly I don\u2019t mind being challenged to to think about why I have the opinions I do, I think that\u2019s healthy and important, but I felt this author did a little too much hand-holding and persuasion in her writing and character portrayal for me to feel good about any of it right now. Knowing how popular this book is, I was a little surprised by what I read, but I guess, as always, you will have to decide for yourself whether it\u2019s a ride worth taking.", "images": [], "asin": "0735224315", "parent_asin": "0735224315", "user_id": "AEX6GC25ANZIT36EQGUAJOGXCPLQ", "timestamp": 1598927011499, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I do like Gemma though.  She manages to carry the book, even though her infatuation with Duncan lessens her sensibiity somewhat.  I am a huge British procedural fan, so I find that this series lacks authenticity and I never forget that it's not written by an English author.  The book did have possibility though.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Very Epic, but very little new.", "text": "The Unremembered is Peter Orullian's very Epic debut. It is Epic in nearly every way. In terms of characters/points of view, battles/skirmishes, plot evasiveness, big magic, along with the scope of the land and its associated cultures. There is also a dark god of a sort who is at the heart of the matter, but little seen. All in all The Unremembered is very reminiscent of Robert Jordan and Eddings so if that is your cup of tea then afternoon tea is ready for you. But if you're expecting much more beyond that than look elsewhere as only a few things differentiate it from its forebears.<br /><br />The Unremembered starts with a prologue that while straight forward enough still leaves so much, perhaps too much, to the imagination involving a race of god like beings responsible for the creation of the world and many others. There is a casting out of one of the gods who is apparently behind all the evil of the world.  We are then flung thousands of years in the future on the world where evil is spreading in a small village where teenage friends Tahn, Sutter, and Wendra are somehow at the crux of some evil plot.<br /><br />The dense story does take awhile to grab hold as things are left sketchy for the main characters as they are dragged around. One thing that tends to grate on me in Epic Fantasy is the reliance on keeping the main character out of the loop following around people blindly, which is the case here. The leads are pushed around and bloodied without so much as a word of why for hundreds of pages from their all-knowing wizard leader.<br /><br />Sometimes I was completely enveloped in the rich and lush world and then I'd get all annoyed because characters kept getting side tracked again and again, which doesn't do much for the core story. Too many flights, too many partings, and predictable meetings. The magic and story are complex and the use of music as magic was interesting, but not well enough explained to fully grasp. Apparently the next volume will go further into it.<br /><br />The Unremembered does shows promise for what could be a remarkable world and cast, but it isn't there yet and I'm not sure Orullian's goal with the story would get it there. The story seems enmeshed in tropes that it loses itself in. The best part of the novel is the relationships, especially between Tahn and Sutter which is what kept me coming back for more. I give The Unremembered 5 out of 10 hats, but the 14 year-old in me would probably give it an 8 if I hadn't read some Jordan prior. I think I'm just a different reader now and expect different things out of my Fantasy then I did even 5 years ago.<br /><br />If you are a fan of 80's and 90's Epic Fantasy and still savor for more than The Unremembered is for you.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The authors are better known as movie and television writers than novelists", "text": "This is a science fiction novel set in the near future in the tradition of Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke. It is the first book in a trilogy and has been optioned by Warner Brothers for a film adaptation.  An asteroid sized object enters the solar system and passes close enough to the Earth for both the United States and a coalition consisting of Russia, India, and Brazil to send missions to explore it.  It is first called a Near-Earth-Object (NEO) with a number, but the public and press name it \u201cKeanu\u201d after the character Keanu Reeves plays in the Matrix movies.  After the astronauts land, they discover that Keanu is really a starship.  I found it to be a very entertaining read.<br /> The authors are better known as movie and television writers than novelists.  Goyer has written Batman Begins, Dark City, Blade, The Dark Knight,  and Man of Steel, and Cassutt has written for the TV shows Max Headroom, Stargate, Farscape, and Eerie, Indiana.  Consequently, there is more emphasis on action than ideas.  There is also one key plot development that is so implausible that I was surprised to see it in a novel, although I would not have been surprised at its inclusion in a movie or television program, for which I have lower standards.

Great vocabulary however it was all just filler and proved more confusing than anything. Several chunks of dialogue were missing end quotations and made it difficult to determine when the spoken dialogue ended and inner thought started. Several instances I also found it difficult to even distinguish which character was speaking.<br />There is nothing romantic about the mental illness and debilitating obsession this young girl has over a boy in her dreams. This story had the potential to be quite cute if done properly. This girl was destroying her physical and mental health over some guy she dreamed of.... its just sickening and terribly disturbing!<br />Most of the characters were incredibly bland unless of course that was the point since the girl was so antisocial?

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Third (of 5) in Clifton Chronicles enjoyable, but not as sizzling as prior two", "text": "\"Secret\" is the third of a planned 5-book saga about the Clifton family of Great Britain, as well as their close friends the Barringtons. We were somewhat surprised that while this entry spans the period of 1945 to about 1958, the just concluded World War gets hardly a mention. Rather, the story now centers more on Harry and Emma's son Sebastian and his years finishing high school and bound for Cambridge. Early on, the debate over Harry's paternity, and therefore the inheritance of the Barrington estate, is resolved; so that settles the cliffhanger from book 2. Later, Giles Barrington is involved in an election rigging scheme as he runs for re-election to Parliament; his troubles with a new wife and an insider trading scam with the family's shipping company also absorb a lot of ink. Finally, an adventure with Sebastian disappearing on a trip to Buenos Aires to unwittingly abet a smuggling attempt concludes this third tale. Once again, a cliffhanger has us anxiously awaiting the next installment.<br /><br />While we continue to find Archer's extended yarn engaging, it seemed the \"setup\" work in \"Secret\" got a little long and dry. The relatively abrupt departure of Harry's involvement apparently signals that the next generation is now center stage - and where that might lead is by no means obvious.

I believe Grafton keeps Kinsey in the past because detecting and investigating were so much harder before the days of interwebby access to everyone's personal information.  Instead of two clicks and learning all about a subject, she conducts labored investigations hitting libraries, police departments, hospitals, and newspapers offices to get her info and this really drags out the plot. And I mean REEEEALLY drags out the plot. (Searching microfiche records?  Seriously?  Does Grafton know how many readers do not even know or recall what microfiche was?)  On top of that, Grafton's descriptive style has reached an exponential level.  Just the act of placing of a phone call became two paragraphs describing how she looked at the phone, picked up the receiver, punched numbers (What?  Not dialed on a rotary?), rested  the handset on her shoulder to her ear, listened to the ringing, and then waited for pickup.  Gee, I described all that in one sentence; I could be a mystery writer.  Using the electric typewriter suffered a similar dissection as did almost every other minor act. Thank God we didn't have to hear about Kinsey tying her shoe laces. That may have required a volume 2.  Without all the hyper-description, the book could have been 75 pages long and I could have saved several hours.  The plot was so boring and characters unremarkable that I kept waiting for some moment of clarity or a major plot twist.  I still don't get why the photo of Ned & his mom were so important.  Okay, it was a photo.  What great revelation came from it?  None but it was discussed and discussed.  Yawn.<br /><br />Keeping Kinsey in the recent past prevents any kind advancement in her own personality and growth as a person.  She's still jogging the same 3 miles but never seems to get better at it.  The quirks that endeared Kinsey early on are beginning to sound like she's some sort of emotional cripple or immature misanthrope who cannot grow up--just a weirdo, and not a cute weirdo, just weird.<br /><br />I will finish out the series because there are only a couple volumes left plus I started reading Grafton when she first appeared on the scene all those years ago but I hope the last two are better than X.<br /><br />P.S.

For example, why in this middle story, did she suddenly start using italicized words multiple times a paragraph? it\u2019s a sophomoric technique. I will finish this trilogy just to know where the story goes, but I am fully prepared to skim the third story. Honestly, I\u2019m not a fan of YA so I was prepared to not love it as much as I loved the other two stories, but this was much worse than expected.", "images": [], "asin": "0593128885", "parent_asin": "0593128885", "user_id": "AFZETOXXKEAPGYGQIWF2WAUYVCNQ", "timestamp": 1675630767782, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A highwayscribery \"Book Report\"", "text": "Had Kurt Vonnegut died in January 2009 his literary goodbye, \"A Man Without a Country,\" might have been brighter.<br /><br />Maybe the sea change in American politics was already affecting Vonnegut when he passed on April 11, 2007, but this book, his last sigh, had been published in 2005.<br /><br />That means it would have been written the year before, an annus horribilis, marked by the American peoples' unfortunate validation of George W. Bush's presidency.<br /><br />So Vonnegut, an avowed socialist, was pretty soured on the United States. And that resulted in his swan song being a mixture of a trademark whimsy and heavy doses of dead seriousness.<br /><br />For the book-loving, Vonnegut unpacked this chestnut:<br /><br />\"Do you realize that all great literature -- 'Moby Dick,' 'Huckleberry Finn,' 'A Farewell to Arms,' 'The Scarlet Letter,''The Red Badge of Courage,' 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey,' 'The Bible,' and 'The Charge of the Light Brigade,' -- are all about what a bummer it is to be a human being? (Isn't it such a relief to have somebody say that?)\"<br /><br />Maybe it's a relief if you've lived well and are on the way out, but if a good stretch of road is still in front of you, not so much.<br /><br />In \"Man Without...\" the famed writer riffed often on the oil problem, our national addiction, and the increasingly desperate decisions being made by the country's leaders to placate that addiction.<br /><br />\"Evolution can go to hell as far as I'm concerned. What a mistake we are. We have mortally wounded this sweet life-supporting planet -- and the only one in the whole Milky Way -- with a century of transportation whoopee.\"<br /><br />But, as can be seen from this quote's opening beats, oil addiction is but a symptom. It's the human race that rots.<br /><br />Why was Vonnegut a man without a country? Here's a decent stretch, long in inches, but short in bandwidth, wherein he lays out his case in the writerly way:<br /><br />\"Loaded pistols are good for everyone except inmates in prisons or lunatic asylums.<br />That's correct.<br />Millions spent on public health are inflationary.<br />That's correct.<br />Billions spent on weapons will bring inflation down.<br />That's correct.<br />Dictatorships to the right are much closer to American ideals than dictatorships to the left.<br />That's correct.<br />The more hydrogen bomb warheads we have, all set to go off at a moment's notice, the safer humanity is and the better of the world will be that our grandchildren inherit.<br />That's correct.<br />Industrial wastes, and especially those that radioactive, hardly ever hurt anybody, so everybody should shut up about them.<br />That's correct.<br />Industries should be allowed to do whatever they want to do: Bribe, wreck the environment just a little, fix prices, screw dumb customers, put a stop to competition, and raid the Treasury when they go broke.<br />That's correct.<br />That's free enterprise.<br />And that's correct.<br />The poor have done something very wrong or they wouldn't be poor, so their children should pay the consequences.<br />That's correct.<br />The United States of America cannot be expected to look after its own people.<br />That's correct.<br />The free market will do that.<br />That's correct.<br />The free market is an automatic system of justice.<br />That's correct.<br />I'm kidding.\"<br /><br />Which reminds us of how good writers communicate deep concepts with simplicity and economy.<br /><br />Vonnegut was dead-set against the war in Iraq. His chief grievance was the unprovoked nature of the military action and he drafted a historical parallel with the U.S. invasion of Mexico in the 19th Century.<br /><br />\"More than a decade before his Gettysburg Address, back in 1848, when Lincoln was only a Congressman, he was heartbroken and humiliated by our war on Mexico, which had never attacked us. James Polk was the person Representative Lincoln had in mind when he said what he said. Abraham Lincoln said of Polk, his president, his armed forces' commander-in-chief:<br /><br />Trusting to escape scrutiny, by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory - that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood - that serpent's eyes, that charms to destroy - he plunged into war.<br /><br />Holy s..t! And I thought I was a writer!\"<br /><br />We told you there was whimsy melded into book's gloomy view.<br /><br />One chapter revisits an old Vonnegut favorite about the simplicity of successful story structure, but then goes a step further wherein he demonstrates why \"Shakespeare was as poor a storyteller as any Arapaho,\" whose true virtue was that he told the truth in a world where the truth is in short supply.<br /><br />A lifetime of literary creation and consumption led our subject to crown poet Carl Sandburg a personal favorite, and Ambrose Bierce's \"Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\" as a \"flawless example of American genius like, 'Sophisticated Lady' by Duke Ellington or the Franklin stove.\"<br /><br />He warns writers off using semi-colons, \"transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing.\" And then, after using one, remarks, \"The point is: Rules only take us so far, even good rules.\"<br /><br />\"Man Without a Country\" plugs Eugene Debs and plies the sad story of Ignaz Semmelweis.<br /><br />This gentleman convinced his unbelieving fellow doctors that leaving the morgue after doing autopsies to perform surgery on live patients, without washing their hands first, was causing a lot of death.<br /><br />It is a story of truth spurned and suicide and one of the reasons, along with Vonnegut's presence at the firebombing of Dresden, he lost hope in the human race.<br /><br />Like my distinct betters Einstein and Twain, I now give up on people, too. I am a veteran of the Second World War and I have to say this is not the first time I have surrendered to a pitiless war machine.<br /><br />My last words? 'Life is no way to treat an animal, not even a mouse.'\"<br /><br />Perhaps it was the responsibility of Vonnegut's editor to loyally assist in the assaying of a downer document. We expect these things from older people. Their pessimism completes the arc of our devolutionary intellectual development.<br /><br />But we also expect wisdom from a life lived well and fully. So highwayscribery is going to step in and close this report with something that appeared at the beginning of the book and, for that reason, may have been lost to those who closed \"A Man Without a Country,' in gloom.<br /><br />It is advice with which highwayscribery agrees, often propounds to novice writers, and finds worthy of such a fine man and artist:<br /><br />\"If you want to hurt your parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Has some problems, but an enjoyable read", "text": "\"The Familiar Stranger\" is a contemporary Christian fiction novel. The pacing was very good, and the world-building was okay. In the first half of the novel, a noticeable amount of dialogue (including inner dialogue) felt unnatural to me--and I'm not talking about when awkward dialogue might be expected. In the second half, though, this problem disappeared and the writing was excellent.<br /><br />The characters were sympathetic enough characters, but the only ones I really bonded with were the kids. This may partly be because I've never seriously dated or been married or had a loved one in a bad accident so I couldn't personally relate to the stress the adults were going through. I did like the way the author handled the struggles that the characters went through, though.<br /><br />I suspect most people will thoroughly enjoy the novel, but I didn't fully enjoy it because there were two or three \"mighty convenient\" things that happened at critical points in the story to make it end up where it did. I would have liked for these points to have been fleshed out to make them more realistic and probable.<br /><br />The characters were Christians living out their faith. The novel wasn't preachy, but there was a large amount of God-talk and praying. Non-Christians probably wouldn't enjoy this book. There was no sex and no bad language.

Many times I thought I flipped through too many pages on the Kindle because the story jumped forward so abruptly.  Also, some of the jumping back and forth between the past and the present without and segue was hard to wrap my head around.<br /><br />I also found myself skimming most of the book just hopping to get to the legitimate storylines.<br /><br />I did enjoy the characters and the story is refreshing.

Gemma and Fee are waiting to enter society as women and Ann is preparing to become a nanny. The girls have much to discover, such as their desires, destines and who are their true friends and enemies.<br /><br />The book is a long 800+ pages, and to be frank sometimes it felt like it. The book starts out with a lot of talk about balls and the Victorian Era. For people who want to read about the Realms and Kartik the first 200/300 pages maybe a bit tiresome. Also I felt the book could have moved a little more quickly. Around page 600 or so I found myself flipping through the pages in order to get to the good stuff.<br /><br />The writing is good. The plot dragged a tad, and after much thought I agree Gemma's character didn't progress as I hoped it would.<br /><br />The ending is bittersweet for Gemma and many readers are having a difficult time with this. I can understand that because when I read Little Women I was upset when Jo refused to marry Laurie. Still, the readers' passion impresses me because these are teens that care deeply for characters in a YA book series. And who says teens don't read!<br /><br />Gemma's decision at the end was a bit of a shocker.

Picard and Spock working together. The Cold War between the Romulans and the Federation getting renewed after the Dominion War. Even a mention of a post-Sisko Deep Space Nine. Alas, the authors' reach exceeded their grasp.<br /><br />The action jumped from scene to scene with many loose ends left untied. What exactly was the point of the Lotre character? What did T'sart want with the device and why was he even in the book? Folan's actions had no consequences. And all the secondary characters and subplots: Tobin and Nien, the aforementioned DS9, the Klingons. All these elements were thrown together in one big stew without much organization.<br /><br />That said, I did like the Picard, Spock, Data interaction and the dialogue between Data, Riker, and Troi. In fact, I think Galanter and Brodeur have a real knack for writing for Data. Some of his scenes were downright amusing.<br /><br />But even that could not make up for the incomprehensible ending. All those theories and mysterious tools and omnipotent aliens were just too much to keep track of and I still don't understand what happened. I think some Trek authors have fallen in the same trap that many Star Wars writers fell into: the superweapon-of-the-week. It was just too big; I mean if the entire galaxy is threatened (or more), then wouldn't the Q or another of the omnipotent aliens have shown up to save themselves? And what was with the brief mention of the Guardian of Forever?<br /><br />One last nitpick for the publisher, not the authors: Do a better job of editing.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A unique concept I have never seen before. Excellent worldbuilding!", "text": "Stars: 3 out of 5<br /><br />There is a fascinating premise in this book. What if all humans have two souls inhabiting one body? One has the reigns during the day, the other one during the night? And those are completely different people. They have different names and personalities. They want different things in life. They have different professions. Heck, most of them are even married to different people either night or day. Or married at night but single during the day. Or the night-brother had committed a crime and stays in prison during the night, but their day-brother is released to live their life every morning because it's not fair to punish both souls for the mistakes of just one.\u00a0<br /><br />Some people are lucky enough to live harmoniously with their night or day sibling. Some even hold the same profession on both sides of the ettienne. Others are not so lucky. In fact, it seems like a horrible way to live, if you think about it. You wake up every morning/night next to a stranger that your day/night sibling is married to. How awkward is that? It also seems like one sibling will be more dominant over the other.<br /><br />Like in the case of our protagonist. The night brother is a special inspector, so his job takes precedence over his day brother who is a musician. When the inspector has to leave town on an investigation, the day brother has no choice but to follow, no matter how inconvenient that is for his professional and personal life.\u00a0<br /><br />I would have loved to explore this fascinating world a bit more. Like what happens to the children of those married couples? If the night sister is the mother of the children, but the day sister is unmarried and leads a completely different life, who takes care of the children during the day? Especially when they are babies? Does the day sister have a choice in the matter or is she forced to care for them no matter what? Wouldn't that create resentment between the siblings? Wouldn't the children suffer because of that?<br /><br />The mystery itself is rather complex and progresses at a very leisury pace. In fact almost half the book is setup, and even though the story picks up in the second half, it can still be a slog. There are also some leaps of logic that I found hard to follow. And some plot holes that were rather glaring. Like we are expressly told that the father packed up his family and left town after his wife was arrested. Yet, both the oldest and the youngest children are conveniently present to be sacrificed for the ritual. How did that happen? Also, where is the middle sister and the father? Also, this horrible murder of children isn't even mentioned or addressed in any way afterwards. And the mother doesn't express a single ounce of grief or regret over it. And that is the night-sister that gave birth and raised those children.\u00a0<br /><br />All in all, it was interesting mostly for the unique concept and worldbuilding, but I wasn't totally onboard for the story itself. And while I liked both Christophor and Alexander, I wasn't as thrilled with the other characters in this book. And I would have loved a few more answers to the day-to-day conundrum that having two souls in one body represents, because from where I stand, this is the definition of hell.<br /><br />PS: I received a free copy via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "1801101647", "parent_asin": "1801101647", "user_id": "AHQT3JAIHOGZUP7ADMFMYOCOGGMA", "timestamp": 1678112280106, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Which nursing sessions should I drop as my baby gets older<br />2. Do I give him cows milk AT ALL while I'm nursing and yet weaning?<br />3.

What is normal milk production for a working mother (such as myself)?

However, I found myself conflicted and liking Musk less and less the more I read.<br /><br />In Musk's world, my daughter would struggle to exist. It's a man's club. All the early team members were men. And the one woman who asked for a raise was fired. (The men, by comparison, all got raises.)<br /><br />I'm about the same age as Musk and I could never be Musk even though I have a similar capacity for innovation.<br /><br />In my Fortune 500 days a VP tried to fire me as a cost savings measure. Except I had key certifications and expertise in mandatory regulatory compliance so the company had to keep me. I was punted to another group to get my costs off the VP's budget. At which point I had a better boss, but left the company anyway. Like Musk, I could make something out of nothing. I could bring groups together, identify resources and hack bottlenecks. But it didn't matter. I was the wrong gender.<br /><br />So I could never be Musk. I felt that acutely as I read.  I'm a woman, and for my generation, gender was difficult to overcome. I hit the glass ceiling and it never cracked for me. Yet I could give speeches at national organizations and get five different job offers. I could never reconcile that.<br /><br />For as much as Musk is a genius, he is still very much a product of a patriarchy that actively works against women. He is still very much a product of a culture full of privilege for white men that has little interest in diversity. American Business hasn't evolved. It's still a one note choir that ignores the rest of the scale. And Musk doesn't seem to have any awareness of this. He's blind.<br /><br />Musk also wants to take us to Mars, but, as I read, I found myself asking, what's the point of going to Mars if our culture can't figure out how to sustain a planet or incorporate a diverse population? If we don't change, Mars won't save us. I wonder if Musk is tackling the wrong issues. Rockets are nice, but if they are exporting misogyny, racism and greed...what's the point?

There is minimal development even on the two point-of-view characters, Mare and Denna. For secondary characters, the development is literally non-existent. Everyone is either good or bad with no grey area or depth to be found anywhere. I was especially disappointed in the lack of depth of both Thandi and Alisendi because they had such important roles to the main story. I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you anything about them aside from Thandi\u2019s unwillingness to listen to reason and Alisendi\u2019s hope that her sister will stuff herself into the role that has been forced upon her by her station.<br /><br />The world is much like the characters within it: falling sadly flat with little description of it aside from the separation or unity of Affinities and the Six Gods, who are not elaborated upon beyond the affinities they represent. Hints are given as to the existence of a specific \u201corder\u201d in which the Gods should be displayed based on religious sect, but the actual order and representative colors are never given. Almost no elaboration is given to regional cultures, languages, or daily life. Vague hints are given to climate differences of different regions as well as regional preferences for a single specified god of the six available for three of the regions discussed.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most is the plethora of questions that stuck with me at the end of the story, especially since it didn\u2019t seem like the author was really trying for a cliff-hanger. How did the information get out of the castle and into the two rivaling factions ears with such speed and accuracy? How was the Directorate able to capture so many of the Recusants when they couldn\u2019t even figure out where their new meeting location was? I also have a question as to why the author picked who she did as the villain, but to ask openly would spoil the entire book and I try so very hard not to post spoilers in my reviews. Needless to say the end, like much of the rest of the book, left me frustrated.<br /><br />The only thing I really enjoyed about Of Fire and Stars was the romance between Mare and Denna, but even that left something to be desired. I will admit I spent most of the book anticipating the romance between the two of them, which carried me through much of the story by itself. Said anticipation (and my curiosity of where the story would take the two of them) allowed me to read the book in only a day. Out of that curiosity, I might read a sequel if it were published but I\u2019d likely stick with the library instead of purchasing it. The idea behind this story had so much promise and the follow-through just wasn\u2019t up to my expectations of it.<br /><br />For this review and more, please visit my blog, Vicarious Bookworm", "images": [], "asin": "0062433253", "parent_asin": "0062433253", "user_id": "AFKFOYY7M2WJT2UQTIBNX7V4XOOA", "timestamp": 1484234671000, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": true}

I really didn't think the whole story about Helen and her ex was believable, but I suppose it's the only way the author could place this otherwise smart woman in such deplorable working conditions.

I got attracted to Nesbo and Hole by two of his later volumes, Nemesis, and Redbreast, which I liked a lot. Harry Hole is a Norwegian cop with a mixed history, including a wild youth and alcoholism. In this first case of the series he is sent to Sydney to help the Aussi police in investigating the murder of a young Norwegian woman. The case widens into more than just a single murder. There is so much more, that I lost interest. Nesbo did not yet know how to focus.<br /><br />A warning: this book is not available in English. I read the German translation, since I would have needed two months trying to read the Norwegian original. This translation is lousy, or, alternatively, the English translator of the other books was so good that he made bad writing look good in translation.<br /><br />In other words: stay away! Why then 2 stars and not 1? Because there are strong chapters, mainly those dealing with Hole in the early phase of the case, transported to The Land Down Under and trying to find his bearing. That is quite good, actually. But then the plot unfolds and leaves you cold in all its overdone heat.<br /><br />The book's title? There seems to be an Aboriginal myth of death as a bat.

Satisfied that Tino and the man on the street are the same, Shakespeare sets out to kill him.<br /><br />A plot summary doesn't really sum up this novel very well since it's told in a violently fragmented, non-linear way. It's far more psychological, dream-like and meandering than most thrillers and it's really primarily a literary novel which features a few thriller elements rather than an intricately plotted crime fiction novel.<br /><br />The main character was a member of the unit assigned to track down those responsible for murdering Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. A few flashbacks recount the secret missions of the unit but most of the book explores the themes of fragmented identity, the Jewish experience in the twentieth century and the history of Israel. The author, Joshua Sobol, has won the Sapir Prize, an important literary prize in Israel, and has written many plays.<br /><br />Though much of the book focuses on the memories and experiences of the main character with the chase relegated to the background, the novel does achieve a bit of suspense at the end with a shoot-out in the New Mexico desert.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not good, not bad, just meh", "text": "\u201cWe don\u2019t get to choose what hurts us\u201d<br /><br />I had been wanting to read this book since its release in 2019. It sounded a little spooky with high stakes, fantasy elements, and sapphic themes. All of those things are right up my alley and putting them together? I just assumed it would be a slam dunk read.<br /><br />Sadly, this book fell firmly into what I call the \u201cmeh\u201d category.<br /><br />We all know the \u201cmeh\u201d category. Not good, not bad, it just kind of exists in a purgatory of not eliciting emotions one way or the other. One of the major themes of this book is body horror. A group of girls are quarantined on an island that houses their school after some sort of disease broke out that caused their bodies and, eventually, minds to mutate in horrific ways. These physical mutations are described for nearly every person our lead character comes across in the book and, well, it did nothing for me. The descriptions sounded like something a pre-teen boy would come up with in a ludicrous story he tells his friends. \u201cThere\u2019s something living behind her eyes, guys! And she can\u2019t open her eye! They sew it closed!\u201d Yawn.<br /><br />(Minor spoilers) Throughout the story the idea of fierce loyalty bred from necessity is enforced multiple times. These girls are trapped in their school with mutated animals bent on devouring them knocking at their doors. They only have each other and they protect one another. However, when push comes to shove our leading characters abandon their schoolmates without a second thought, focused only on themselves and their own wants.<br /><br />Overall, I didn\u2019t understand the point of this book. Quite frankly, there didn\u2019t seem to be one. There was a problem with no solution proposed, by the end the stakes had been stripped away, and the presented character developments meant nothing. The only saving grace of this story is that the writing style had good flow and after the first quarter of the story or so there were no lulls to drag you into boredom.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Does better when discussing the impact of politics on the economy", "text": "The poor performance of Arab economies has been well documented, including in the much-cited Arab Human Development Report written by Arab intellectuals for the U.N. Development Program.[1] But the numbers, no matter how well presented, do not necessarily bring to life how Arab economies actually work as seen by the ordinary businessman or government official. Drawing heavily on his experience from 1998 to 2001 as The Wall Street Journal's Middle East correspondent, Glain provides a series of anecdotes about the lack of government transparency and accountability as well as the other main barriers to economic efficiency. He provides neither a structured or comprehensive account of how the economies work, much less what is needed to improve them. Glain's account is not the place to look for analysis about high politics and diplomacy. He touches on these subjects at times, but what he has to say is of uneven quality-this is obviously not his strong point. In particular, his comments about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict are not insightful.<br /><br />He does better when discussing the impact of politics on the economy where he skillfully musters tales from individual businessmen to bring to life how \"ham-fisted, risk averse bureaucracy\" stifles the rich talent of Arab entrepreneurs and workers. He gives a feel for life's frustrations with stories focused on the main problem of excessive state interference, in all its corruption, neglect, and bad management.<br /><br />Glain considers six areas in successive chapters: Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt, and Iraq. The best chapters by far are those on Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. These bring out how political interference has made two economies with such enormous potential into failures. He is particularly skillful at exposing the wide gaps between rhetoric about economic reform and the unpleasant realities of the continued dead hand of political interference to protect the well-placed. The Syria chapter is impeded by the difficulty of gathering information, and the Iraq chapter suffers from the problem of gauging how the economy is functioning under the peculiar circumstances of an occupation after decades of tyrannical rule.<br /><br />Glain writes with obvious empathy for the suffering Arab peoples, and his confidence in their potential-if freed of such depressing governments-shines through. His account is a good example of the principle that the true friends of the Arabs are those who tell the brutal truth about the poor state to which they have been reduced by their leaders.<br /><br />Patrick Clawson<br /><br />[1] See \"How the Arabs Compare: Arab Human Development Report 2002,\" Middle East Quarterly, Fall 2002, pp. 59-67.", "images": [], "asin": "0312329113", "parent_asin": "0312329113", "user_id": "AFGKAUWLM5BJYCF5BUQSKJBHWPRQ", "timestamp": 1123948710000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

Others are dry and monotonous.  The Windup Girl fell somewhere in between, it's an unabridged reading so it's very long. That's not a complaint. I think unabridged is the way to go in most, if not all, cases. But the reader just isn't that interesting to listen to, unfortunately. Maybe I have a shorter attention span than I thought, but I just kept losing interest throughout. Though it should be pointed out that the reader, Johnathan Davis, is quite experienced.<br /><br />There is an introduction by the author included, talking about the inspiration for the novel - a nice touch to add to the package.<br /><br />The idea of a \"windup girl\" or what the book calls \"New People\", is interesting.  They are artificial, and basically created to be like concubines.  They wind up as sort of homeless beings after being discarded.  The whole sci-fi angle of this story is a guy looking for food in a future where calories are treated like money.  Post apocolyptic stuff, with the apocalypse in this case being biological disease epidemics.<br /><br />Maybe I just can't handle nearly 20 hours of hard, heavy, science-fiction.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Lot's of missed potential", "text": "I was given a free copy of this book in return for my honest review free of persuasion from the author or anyone else associated with the book.<br /><br />The Emerald Key is a young children's story about a group of friends and their adventure into a fairy world where myths are real and dragons are a regular occurrence.<br /><br />The book started off nicely by introducing all main characters and giving an insight into their personality as well as daily routine. Penny and Lacy are the heroines of the story and the two fit nicely into the popular stereotype of school-aged kids. The two can't be more different. Penny is headstrong, beautiful, confident, capable, and loyal friend while Lacy is the smart, shy, always invisible girl. Later on we are introduced to their two companions which happened to be the boys trying to bully them (although in a friendly way). The story develops rapidly with the protagonists finding themselves in a new world rather quickly. They are immediately introduced to their handsome guide who just happened to agree to follow and help them with their seemingly simple mission.<br /><br />This is where, in my opinion, the author ran into some difficulties. Everything about this new world is just too convenient even for a story intended for kids in junior high. Lacy just happens to have a magical book about dragons in her bag and is immediately aware of what to do and how to use it. Upon entering the world, they just came upon this boy that doesn't even seem to find them strange. Everyone speaks English and this fact is never questioned even once.  There is no true explanation about this magical world. We just hear bits and pieces from the local boy and most seem to be connected (in a disjointed way) to various myths from all main ancient civilizations. All this gave me an impression that the author was just making up the story on the go without any prior planning.<br /><br />The action also seemed very flat with no twists or turns - everything just happens to work out just because Penny is so strong and determined and Lacy is smart. Their two companions from back home add no flavor to the story except for bits of humor. Throughout the journey the kids did not learn any lessons or develop any new traits which I think is the most disappointing thing about a story aimed at young kids.<br /><br />Overall, The Emerald Key left me wanting more.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Neat ending, but a struggle", "text": "The book was a disappointment for me: I was hoping for a solidly written tale and a new incredible author. But I really did not find either of these in this book.<br /><br />The author, as another reviewer mentioned, talks too much. There was just too much detail, which detracted from telling a decent story. The back-and-forth of Aurelia's discussions with her conscience were distracting and something of a turnoff...\"I can do this\" vs. \"You can't do this!\"\u2014over and over, making Aurelia seem a little wifty. It took away from her character\u2014she's described as a spy of some talent, but with a wishy-washy personality, it just did not convince, though I wish it had. (There is no rhyme or reason, by the time we approach the turning point, for her to decide that SHE has to do something about the deaths taking place\u2014the reader is never prepared with Aurelia to understand WHY she feels that way\u2014that thread is never really presented and developed in her.) Some of the language seemed unsuited to the time: for example, \"passel\"\u2014though it's a 19th C. word (I looked it up), it sounds like it belongs in a Western. Also, Aurelia has had three names...that gets confusing and old\u2014and at one point, with no warning, Jason begins to refer to her as Relia. It just comes out of nowhere, having never been used before, and I had to go back to figure out who he was talking about. The author's use of French phrases felt contrived...I don't speak French. At times phrases were explained (even just in context), at other times not...but I just didn't care enough to look them up. Speaking a few phrases does not necessarily create a French character\u2014and I could not understand the reason to try to do so. (Maybe I missed something at the beginning?!\u2014and the beginning does not fit either.) Plot development was rickety...it stumbled in places, rather than flowing along. And the villain just comes out of the blue\u2014I didn't feel like there was any inkling of the person's identity, no subtle clues craftily left like breadcrumbs so the ending provided an \"ah-ha\" moment\u2014it did not! And there were unanswered questions as to why this person killed some of his/her victims.<br /><br />With all that said, the characters are relatively well \"fleshed out.\" They are likeable if not always believable/consistent. But there was enough substance in each that I felt I got to \"know\" them and could cheer them on...to a point. The ghosts, as one reviewer mentioned, were quite a mix of personalities, and really provided a segment of the plot that was unexpected and enjoyable. The turning point of the story was good, as mentioned. Clever.<br /><br />Gabriel, I thought, was a beast, though the author tried to provide him with some moral fiber\u2014he and his entire entourage were, I thought, awful. Redeeming qualities in some? Hard to buy into when the reader knows why they have all gathered with the same intent, the same behaviors, mindsets. Jason's change by the end didn't seem realistic to me\u2014that kind of change does not take place in pages...maybe building throughout the book?... and the ending was just unrealistic\u2014giving the story something of a Cinderella feel.<br /><br />Would I recommend this author? No. I HAD to find out what happened, but feel (with the skimming I did) that I only really read half a book.. It has its moments and a couple of substantial surprises, but I don't feel it was enough. If I had to read one of this author's books to discover if I had found a new favorite, this wasn't the worst book I've read.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A nicely constructed plot with interesting characters", "text": "Dr. Daniel Rinaldi, a Pittsburgh psychologist, gets involved in two police cases. The first involves Wesley Currim, an unpleasant, wise-cracking young man who's confessed to the murder and decapitation of rich executive Edward Meacham. Wes's mother Maggie, however, swears she was with her son at the time of the murder and implores Dr. Rinaldi to help the boy.<br /><br />At the same time Rinaldi is working with the FBI on a case involving serial killer John Jessup, who was convicted of murdering four prostitutes. Jessup, who was killed in a prison riot, had an admirer who wrote him complimentary, supportive letters signed 'Your Biggest Fan'. The admirer is now on a murder spree of his own, killing people responsible for Jessup's imprisonment and death. This seems to includes a prison guard, the judge, the prosecutor, jurors, the defense attorney, and Lyle Barnes, the FBI profiler who fingered Jessup. Barnes now suffers from night terrors and needs the help of a psychologist.<br /><br />Local police are working with the FBI to protect potential victims and nab Jessup's admirer. They're hampered, however, because the killer seems to have inside information: he knows where the authorities are hiding potential victims, knows when they're about to question a witness, etc.  Clearly, the investigation is compromised in some fashion.<br /><br />While working on the cases Rinaldi can't seem to go a day without getting involved in a life-threatening situation such as chasing down a gunman, being run off the road by truck, putting himself in the path of a murderer, and so on. This seems unwise since Rinaldi apparently doesn't carry a weapon or possess martial arts skills. To me, he's somewhat of an unrealistic character - a sort of psychololgist/superhero - but he seems to be a decent enough guy. There's also a touch of romance in the story since Rinaldi gets together with Detective Eleanor Lowrey, a woman he's been attracted to for some time.<br /><br />Eventually Rinaldi comes across information that's pivotal to both cases which leads to the book's climax.

His son is not going to be in the father's league, and this book shows why.  I commend Mr. DeMille for trying to help his son, but he just doesn't have it.  So read any of the great novels by Nelson DeMille as the lone author - The Quest, By the Rivers of Babylon, The Charm School, Cathedral, The Gold Coast, The Gate House, Plum Island, etc. - but if you've not read them, do not begin with this book or judge Mr. DeMille by it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Uncomfortable, slow", "text": "There is a huge difference between and 20 year age gap between two people just beginning a relationship and two people that have a farther-daughters type relationship. This book explores a story about the latter. By the time that I was half way through and already felt that the story dragged a bit, the blossoming romance between the two characters had become unbearable to me. I decided not to waste any more time on a book that I wasn't enjoying. I would have given this book one star, but the writing is good enough that I made it too the half-way point. I'm willing to try reading another novel by the same author to see if this book really is just an unfortunate miss like many other reviewers have indicated.", "images": [], "asin": "0345546903", "parent_asin": "0345546903", "user_id": "AHRLXSM2BXVNFIT7VDYXLPNPQOKA", "timestamp": 1430169505000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
