{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good, but yet, unsatisfying.", "text": "This contemporary western romantic story had all the elements I love to read about: an alpha male who is sweet and respectful to women, a woman in need, tender moments between family... and even some excitement, tension and suspense to boot. And there were some really good moments in the storyline and an abundance of strong characters.<br /><br />I still found the book to be a bit frustrating and unsatisfying though. In some ways it gave too much and it was overkill. Like Logan, our hero, was way too much of everything. Not only has he inherited a valuable, beautiful ranch but he's also an ex rodeo star, has served in the special forces in Iraq, started his own dot.com company (and became a millionaire off it) AND he had time to go to law school. Wow. To go to law school you first have to get your Bachelor's.... so he's been in school for 4 to 7 years (depending) and still managed to do these other things?<br /><br />Yet none of these roles are ever really defined. He starts to sorta get into the ranching thing... but that is the only thing he doesn't have experience in, ironically. (When he was a kid on the ranch, they didn't use it as a ranch, his family were loggers?) I'm not sure why the author felt the need to make Logan SO MUCH but still sorta nothing. Because he doesn't get to wear any of his hats at all.<br /><br />In comparison, Briana, the heroine, is the opposite. She really has no history, except for her famous father, and no hobbies, besides reading. She's uneducated and has a routine management job, her first, at a casino. She seems to be a wonderful mother but doesn't have a clue in many ways. It's interesting that author made the hero so incredible and experienced and adventurous and made the heroine so boring.<br /><br />Then in other ways the author just didn't give enough in the plot. Like there's a suspense plot introduced that never really pans out. Seems awfully coincidental the way it ends too. And it's not even really closed up completely. I can't really argue this point without giving away spoilers so I'll leave it to the reader! And why the ominous overtone from the Indian grandmother that never pans out? What did the election have to do with anything? Basically the story just left me feeling like it was incomplete.<br /><br />BUT even still I did really enjoy the characters. I loved Logan's inner thoughts- he's all male. I really liked Jim, Briana's boss. The kiddos are pretty cute too. Hey, I even enjoyed reading about Vance, the ex. And the book carries a wholesome, Montana awesomeness that was irresistible. I rated it 3 stars because it kept my attention the whole time and I really enjoyed it.

Later in that same chapter, Black Hole Feedback, he puts a particular sound wave in perspective by saying it could be translated to the note of B-flat, but a B-flat that is 57 octaves lower than the middle C on a piano.<br /><br />The book does require some concentration to read, but it isn\u2019t massive intimidating tome.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "So scary, it's unreal", "text": "According to Williams and his reading of his sources Al Qaeda already has the bomb, many times over.  Bin Laden purchased the nukes from Chechen rebels who stole/bought them from disgruntled former Soviet scientists.  Bin Laden also purchased some of the scientists and technicians themselves to keep the bombs in working order.  Furthermore, bin Laden bought fissionable material on the black market and has the ability to turn that material into his own homemade bombs.  He hired some nuclear scientists to help out.  He got the money to pay for this from running the heroin trade out of Afghanistan.<br /><br />The question immediate arises, why hasn't he used the nukes yet?  The answer, according to Williams, is that bin Laden is a very, very careful man with enormous patience who, having spent all that dough, is not about to blow his opportunity to kill four million Americans through doing anything hasty like getting the bombs stopped at the border, or having them inoperative when he pulls the trigger.  The grand plan is to get the nukes into the US and plant them at say seven different locations, including probably New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston, Los Angeles, etc., make his usual pious announcement that it is time for the US to exit all Muslim lands and accept the will of Allah, etc.  And when the US does not, he pulls the trigger, morally secure in the knowledge that he warned us.<br /><br />But there is more.  Williams claims that during the Cold War the former Soviet Union planted suitcase-sized nuclear bombs in many places throughout the United States, and those bombs are still there.  Possibly bin Laden has purchased knowledge of their location and how to work them from former Soviet scientists and military operatives.<br /><br />Williams wrings his hands and wants to know, since this is all public knowledge (he cites the sources on page after page), why the mass media hasn't informed the American public about the impending apocalypse.<br /><br />I don't believe the sky is falling.  I seldom subscribe to conspiracy theories, but I want to be candid here.  I've been reading on his subject for a few years now, and like Williams I can see that the information and the cold logic is out there.  You just have to go after it since the major media don't feel it's in the best interest of their bottom line to make a big deal of something so horrific as a possible nuclear attack on the United States--especially considering that nobody, but nobody knows how to do anything about it.<br /><br />Certainly not the Bush administration, which is decidedly NOT addressing the subject in public.  They cannot for fear of causing a panic.  Think what would happen to the stock market if the Bush administration admitted that an unpreventable nuclear attack on US was likely and imminent.<br /><br />Personally I used to live in the Los Angeles area.  I moved not long ago.  The Long Beach-Los Angeles harbor is the biggest port of entry for cargo containers in the United States.  Of the millions that come into the port every year only about three percent are inspected.  I didn't like the odds.<br /><br />I would also like to point out first the obvious that the Bush administration has not gotten bin Laden and that we have no deterrent against him.  We could blow up Pakistan (where he is presumably hiding) but we might never know if we got him or not.  Furthermore, he doesn't care.  The thrill of killing four million Americans (Al Qaeda's stated goal \"justified\" by how many Muslims America has supposedly killed) clearly would outweigh his fear of death.<br /><br />Second, note that the people who mailed the anthrax letters a month after the World Trade Towers went down have never been apprehended or even identified.  But if you read the media closely, it is clear that the most likely suspect is not a disgruntled or deranged government employee but instead the very same Al Qaeda that conducted the September 11th massacre.  Williams notes that Al Qaeda has anthrax and other biochemical agents.<br /><br />I mention this because the reason that the Bush administration and the mass media no longer mention the anthrax mailings is the same reason they don't talk about the missing Soviet nukes and the likelihood of where they are, namely because to speak truthfully about these things is to spread fear and panic among the general public and to admit to an inability to do anything about it.  This is the reason we are facing these horrendous threats in silence<br /><br />Amazing, you say?  It is.  And it is as crazy or even crazier than the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) that prevailed during the Cold War, and, by the way, still prevails to some extent today.<br /><br />Bottom line is that some humans will murder one another in an attempt to get what they want.  They will wantonly kill one another in the name of God or because of hate or prejudice.  And with nuclear weapons now over-the-counter items, they will do so in massive numbers, and again, guess what?  Until we change human nature or find a way to actually prevent (make physically impossible) its use, the mushroom cloud will once again envelope a human city, and probably in the near future.  And that city will be an American city.<br /><br />Count on it, is what Williams is telling us.  He cites sources throughout and fills his narrative with the most compellingly veracious-sounding detail that I am fairly crying out for somebody to demonstrate, item by item, that he is in error.  I wish I could.  The truth is, I think he's right.<br /><br />Read this book at your peril.  It might give you nightmares.  It might bring on clinical depression.  It might make you as cynical as satan.  Or don't read it.  Sometimes, ignorance (if you can stand it) really is bliss.", "images": [], "asin": "1591023491", "parent_asin": "1591023491", "user_id": "AFNKPUJHXI62LMB2U7OAWC7ICUXA", "timestamp": 1139949589000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice book in a very simplistic sort of way", "text": "Did I like this book? Well, yes and no. I know it sounds a bit strange but I enjoyed the simplicity and unpretentiousness of the projects but at the same time I didn't like those same attributes because as a quilter they seemed so basic and something only a beginner would be interested in. Am I likely to make any of the 16 little quilts in the book?  Probably not but then maybe because part of the charm (and challenge) of the projects is that they are small. The cover quilt Little Strippy, for example, is 12 3/8&#34; x 15 1/8&#34; and the finished blocks within it are only 1 1/2&#34;! The biggest quilt Scrap-Box Strip is 26 3/4&#34; x 36 1/4&#34; and is simply a larger version of the cover quilt. Another larger quilt Scrappy Pinwheels is 20&#34; x 26&#34;. Most of the other projects run in the 15&#34; to 18&#34; range but there is one that finishes at 11&#34; square and another 12 1/2&#34; square. There is one runner that measures 6 1/8&#34; x 17 1/2&#34;.<br /><br />Quilt blocks include 4 patches, 9 patches, flying geese (using flipped corners), 2 applique projects (1 with hexagon flowers), pinwheels, modified log cabin, and square in a square.<br /><br />The book is well written and I enjoyed Kathleen's discussion about earlier quilters, fabric storage and fabric variety. Quilting suggestions are given but I found them very simplistic almost primitive style even for these little projects. I didn't read it in the book but the quilting of the projects looks like it may have been by hand. I guess if I were hand quilting these projects (I've done very little hand quilting) then I'd appreciate keeping the quilting simple.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the publisher had used a larger print font.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Another installment in the Charlie Parker series and my love for these books just continues to grow", "text": "Another installment in the Charlie Parker series and my love for these books just continues to grow. Charlie has been contacted by his old friend Elliot Norton and asked to come to South Carolina to help clear a young man of a murder charge. After he arrives, he helps to transport the young man to a safe house, but just as Charlie starts to investigate the young man is murdered. Parker knows there is more to this than meets the eye. His investigation will take him back into the past of two families, one black and one white and uncover a horrifying crime. Meanwhile, back in Maine, Rev. Faulkner is trying to orchestrate his release from prison but Lewis and Angel have other plans.<br /><br />This is another hit for me and bonus points because there are no spiders. I continue to love the whole cast of characters and I like that the characters\u2019 stories carry over from one book to the next. Angel is still struggling to overcome the trauma Rev. Faulkner inflicted on him. We get to learn a little more about Lewis\u2019s history, and the relationship between Charlie and Rachel continues to develop. As usual, John Connolly delivers a story that is twisty, filled with action, and full of surprises. The narration was top-notch and one of the best I\u2019ve heard. Paul Birchard did an excellent job of differentiating the characters with subtle changes of accent and delivery, and his narration style really heightened the drama.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "\"Get rid of the money\": it worked, at least this once", "text": "What if rock and roll was taken as seriously as jazz? Paul McCartney, at Cass Elliot's house in 1967, discussed this with The Mamas and the Papas' John and Michelle Phillips, and their manager Lou Adler. A few nights later, this shifted into what became the first mass concert, thirty or so acts over three June days in The Summer of Love, that raised funds for charity. This carefully documented, well-illustrated history, interspersed with reminiscences from musicians, participants, planners, and fans, brings this festival into the spotlight, where often it has been overshadowed by the far-more hyped and arguably less-successful Woodstock. Editors Harvey and Kenneth Kubernik note that Monterey Pop as a non-profit enterprise generates music scholarships, academic endowments, and healthcare for musicians over forty-four years and counting.<br /><br />Guided by Beatles publicist Derek Taylor and Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham, and supervised by a \"board of governors\" listing McCartney, Adler, John Phillips, Mick Jagger, Terry Melcher, Johnny Rivers, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon, Donovan, and Brian Wilson, their combined clout meant that they could invite the best in the business to perform--for no profit but guaranteed first-class expenses. Taylor wryly noted in the concert's program: \"Entertainers who have starved and become rich are forever haunted by guilt.\"<br /><br />This narrative, and often orally transcribed, history follows the concert from planning to promotion to production, and reads as if the script of a generously funded documentary, moving efficiently while showing visual elements and musical summaries that invite one to seek out the first rock concert film, D.A. Pennebaker's \"Monterey Pop\" (1968), or the four-CD Rhino Records (1997) box set of the music, to accompany the pages and photos.<br /><br />Pennebaker sums up Lou Adler's genius: \"Get rid of the money.\" Trouble was, Owsley Stanley's \"Monterey purple\" acid distributed freely contributed to lots of unease as well as some great, or failed, performances on and off stage. Pennebaker's efforts to capture the atmosphere cannot have been helped by lighting director Chip Monck's lysergic condition, for all he registered as a color, he testifies, was red. Pennebaker was told by Janis Joplin's then-manager to aim the camera at the ground when Big Brother stunned the crowd during their scheduled performance, Saturday afternoon. He tried, cowed by goons, but he caught enough to convince the singer and her band to come back and play the next night. They became stars.<br /><br />The Who would trash their equipment, and Jimi, who won the coin toss with Pete Townshend, would follow with lighting his guitar on fire after seducing, or assaulting, it.  Ravi Shankar left after The Who: \"My feelings were hurt deeply, as well as my respect for music and the instruments. We ran away from the festival.\" Roger Daltrey counters--after noting how Hendrix copied a lot of his Monterey stage act from Townshend, adding to it \"genius\" and not only musical but theatrical inspiration--how his band was hustled away. \"We reminded them how the world was in a s--t state, that it wasn't peace and love at all [laughs].\"<br /><br />Part of the appeal of this book is finding out about the less-heralded moments. Mike Bloomfield tells of his band The Electric Flag: \"Probably the biggest gig we ever played. And we played rotten, man, I ain't jiving you. We really sounded lousy. And the people loved it. And I could see--oh my God, the hype, the image, the shuck, the jive.\"<br /><br />Laura Nyro left in tears, in a black evening gown dress out of place among patchouli and paisley, thinking she'd been booed off stage. Near her death decades later, Adler and Pennebaker working on a DVD of the concert found out that she had not. Tape analysis verified what sounded like \"boo\" was \"beautiful.\"<br /><br />No follow-up occurred although the city approved one; by July 1968, violence had scarred much of the world beyond this tony resort and military town on the peaceful Californian coast below the Bay Area. Still, as curator Marisa Mercado notes accurately, the notoriety of the counterculture left its municipal mark. A few stayed, as the Bay Area's vibrations reverberated and then faded. \"Hippies became homeowners. In the end, Monterey solidified as that charming tourist town that people love to visit, but can't afford to live in.\"", "images": [], "asin": "1595800603", "parent_asin": "1595800603", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1321322814000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Andrew and Abby Borden were both brutally murdered in their home with an axe; Andrew\u2019s daughter Lizzie was arrested and brought to trial for their murders. She was found not guilty and the murders are still unsolved today. Sarah Schmidt took a 10 year writing process/obsession and has brought us the fictional account of what led to the murders and afterwards with See What I Have Done.<br /><br />There are four narrators in See: Lizzie, her sister Emma, Bridget the maid, and the enigmatic Benjamin who is a fictional character. Each narrator brings something different to this very disturbing story and family. It is a slow moving novel that at times can be hard to follow with the narratives. See goes back and forth within the chapters which can be confusing.  I had to reread some paragraphs several times because of the confusion.<br /><br />There is a timeline included at the end of the novel. I felt that would have been better used at the beginning as an introduction to see where things will go for those who don\u2019t know many details about the case. I felt a \u201ccast of characters\u201d would have been helpful as Schmidt seems to assume that the reader will know who each character is.<br /><br />Even knowing this novel is fictional, it all seemed very real.  This comes with the in-depth research that Schmidt did. It does make you think about the case and wonder what really happened.  If you are looking for a good fictional introduction to Lizzie Borden, this is the place to start. If you are looking for anything \u2018new\u2019 with the case or any conclusions as to who did commit the murders, you will not get that.<br /><br />Despite the issues I had, Schimidt did a very good job with See, which is her debut novel and it is an accomplishment.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Passionately Argued Polemic That Neglects the Humanities Somewhat", "text": "Salman Khan&#34;s book has achieved considerable success in its description of the creation of the Khan Academy, giving generations of learners worldwide the opportunity to become responsible for their own learning by accessing a range of videos through YouTube on a variety of subjects - science, math, chemistry, etc. - and using the feedback software created by the author with sponsorship support from luminaries such as Bill Gates and Google.<br /><br />While Khan is to be congratulated on his pioneering efforts, it has to be said that his book does contain certain flaws.  His criticism, of the modern education system is based on assumptions expressed by many radical educational theorists of the past: the system, created in the Victorian era, was designed to produce generations of learners equipped for manual work.  Now it seems outmoded, with learners forced a lot of the time to memorize material that they will almost instantly forget.  Khan is also good at pointing out the shortcomings of the exam system that benefits those with highly developed short-term memories rather than those with genuine enthusiasm for their subjects.  He favors instead a more individualized system: through the internet, with help from mentors, learners can go at their own pace and make their own judgments as to their educational progress.<br /><br />The basic framework of his book is a good one: schools should avoid rigid subject specialization and concentrate instead on whole-person activities designed to foster a learning environment.  Yet Khan's grasp of how this might be achieved in the humanities is often tenuous.  He argues with justification that learners need to be encouraged to want to read the classics, rather than having them forced down their throats during English lessons; but quite how this could be done through online methods is never wholly explained.  Moreover Khan neglects the power of face-to-face contact; however much we may need technology to conduct research in today's world, we need to understand something about the ways in which people think and react paralinguistically.  This can only be achieved through direct interaction.  I am not suggesting that online methods of education using new technologies are not good - I happen to think that they can promote the kind of direct communication often absent in the ordinary classroom.  On the other hand, I think learners and educators still need to collaborate directly so as to refine their methods of working online.  Don't throw the baby out with the bath-water, so to speak.<br /><br />THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE is a passionate work, the product of a highly intelligent mind that has applied itself to a social mission, even though it depends on capitalist investment.  On the other hand, I think that some of its arguments need to be approached from a more transdisciplinary angle, so as to encompass the humanities as well as the sciences.  The humanities might not be so 'productive' in terms of creating future generations of job-ready graduates, but they occupy an important position in the curriculum nonetheless.", "images": [], "asin": "1455508373", "parent_asin": "1455508373", "user_id": "AEJMZWFQBPXWVDXHJ7RSDRY3XOCA", "timestamp": 1438441845000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

My family, at that time consisted of my only son, my mother who helped me tear my child from 18 months until she died in 1999 and me. The moment my mother died this person made it get life's work to insert a wedge between my son and me. Because her family shunned her for marrying my son and detached her from the family,  she has no one. And in turbans didn't want my son to have anyone else but her. She had been around the corner, but my mother and I kept my son as close to the bosom as two doting African-American mothers could. I didn't realize until 20 years after my mother 's demise that she had replaced me in my son's eyes as \"Mother\". The person he'd fallen in love with and married was insecure, conniving, vengeful and jealous of my relationship with my son. I can't even say her name. I've had 20 years  of psychological  treatment during the loss of my relationship with my son. I have one grandson and was relocated to Orlando by my son and her to help with his care two months prior to his birth. After 2.5 years of caring for My Little Precious, I was fired for \"not following directions\". Denied any access to my grandson, I had a mini-stroke. I had to stay with them for a few months as a result of my health change and loss of independence. I've since been placed in a retirement community, 95% Caucasian residents, 15 to 25 years older than I am. Despite my love for my grandson and his love for me, they refuse to let me see him. They don't want him to love me and have done everything possible to turn him against. This is a horrible existence, not to see my grandson and to have to accept the experience of my son's toxic marriage through being abandoned and unloved. She is most happy with what she's accomplished. My son is a Psychologist and is unable to see his situation. Reading this book, I was not surprised by the behave of the German Officer, other officers, the confessions of those interviewed.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Our Story", "text": "Diana Butler Bass does a fine job of writing a history of Christianity in the vein of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States. Instead of focusing on what Butler Bass calls \"Big-C Christianity: Christ, Constantine, Christendom, Calvin, and Christian America,\" she unfolds the history of the faith through the stories of the little people and the grassroots movements. This provides for a fascinating and extremely refreshing understanding of our past and an illumination of the effects it has had upon our present and possibly our future.<br /><br />This is the other side of Christian history, or as Paul Harvey might have said, the rest of the story. There are great lessons and cautionary tales herein concerning what it means to radically follow Jesus Christ, especially in the face of opposition from the powers that be, both pagan and hierarchical. Butler Bass provides a cool drink of water for many of us who have found that power, prosperity and aggression are not necessarily signs of God's grace and favor, in other words, those who oppose the current captivity of the church by American Cultural Religion and the exportation of that demonic malformation to the rest of our planet.<br /><br />A People's History is a salve for the hurting. Well written, innovative, redemptive, open and honest; the story of God's people rather than the hierarchy's Towers of Babel. I particularly appreciate how Butler Bass tells our story from the perspective of Jesus, ethics and devotion rather than from the perspective of power, dogma and conquest.<br /><br />\"More than anything else,\" says Butler Bass, \"Christianity is a love song.\" That is so evident in her lyrical look at the story. Our story. The story of the \"Generative Christians\" who live a faith that births new possibilities of God's love into the world; transformative rather than hierarchical, formative instead of triumphant, gracious rather than merely victorious. This is a book that has found a permanent place on my bookshelf from whence it shall be often retrieved. I highly recommend it to everyone, and particularly to those who follow Christ.

I also liked the way she interspersed Cal's backstory in, it wasn't a major focus but it provided some great flavor to his character.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed the process of reading it, I did ultimately feel like there was not a lot of payout at the end, especially compared to some of her other works.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Back In The Saddle", "text": "Old Boys continues the saga of Paul Christopher and his enigmatic but always engaging clan. Paul is a member of \"The Outfit\", i.e. a CIA agent, who has led a very active and fascinating life, all chronicled in the earlier entries of this \"series\". McCarry's books are reminiscent of LeCarre's and also John Lawton's, with more mind-games than gun-play, and with complicated international historical puzzles to be pieced together rather than \"cases\" to be solved. Hopefully without sounding condescending, if you like \"intellectual espionage thrillers\" as opposed to \"adrenaline powered\" ones, I highly recommend Charles McCarry.<br /><br />That said Old Boys is a little different than its predecessors. Although the now aged Paul Christopher plays a critical role - he goes missing - the story's narrator and protagonist is his also aged cousin, Horace Hubbard. Horace was a central character in Shelley's Heart - which I am going to have to re-read - and is now \"retired\" and well - \"disgraced\".  And as a story-teller Horace more than a little resembles Nelson DeMille's character - John Corey.<br /><br />Now a quick word on the plot - Within the first 30 pages of the book, the author sets up a conundrum involving Paul's disappearance, the Christopher family tree, the roots of Christianity, Nazi Germany including Reinhard Heydrich, Islamic terrorism and the possible destruction of the world as we know it.  Horace pulls together a team of \"Old Boys\" from The Outfit to tackle the job and find his cousin. If that sounds a little crazy, it is. So the reader needs, at least to a minor extent, to suspend some disbelief in order to enjoy this ride. If that's too much to ask, then don't bother picking up Old Boys. If you can, you're in for a wildly entertaining story as Horace and his senior citizen buddies return to the spy-world, travel the globe, utilize old connections - and of course save the world.<br /><br />Old Boys isn't farce or comedy, but at times gets real close to being such, so depending on your \"attitude\" - you'll either chuckle along or groan.<br /><br />The \"puzzle\" here is just as complicated as those in the previous books; tying together the past and the present, which all has an effect on the future. The \"Old Boys\" with their aches and pains - but most importantly their experience - are an engaging cast of characters. The reader meets - again - Paul Christopher's mother and is also introduced to his daughter - a force in her own right - and an ex-wife, who is good for a few laughs. Old Boys is much lighter in tone than McCarry's earlier books, but I still found it a highly entertaining adventure story..", "images": [], "asin": "1585675458", "parent_asin": "1585675458", "user_id": "AFGEL7XKPUAHC4TE4DUYL4D5XLUQ", "timestamp": 1314720688000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Book Review: Two Moon Princess", "text": "This is a hard book to review.  It was an easy read, but there are elements of the story that didn't flow well, and the characters can be hard to like.  But, I enjoyed the premise, and thus found the entire story enjoyable.<br /><br />Andrea was hard-headed and extremely stubborn.  For the most part this benefited who she was and what she wanted to do.  She's not the princess we usually see in fairy tales.  She has no desire to learn to be a lady and would be considered a tomboy (and that's putting it mildly).  But there were times I really wanted to yell at her.  She has a habit of thinking something was a great idea and going with it.  She doesn't bother to think about the consequences and how her actions might effect others.  I think so many things could have been avoided if she would just stop and ask herself a couple questions before proceeding.  But then we wouldn't have much of a story.<br /><br />The supporting cast of characters was a mix.  John was an interesting character when he was in California.  Stick him in Andrea's world and all of a sudden he became the guy I wished would disappear.  He thought it was all a game and so he never realized what was at stake.  Andrea's father...I disliked immensely.  He was just as stubborn as Andrea and wanted such a different life for her.  Not to mention that he was such a man in so many ways.  I loved Don Julian and his brother Alfonso.  They both brought a lot of life to the story.  I had a feeling there was something more to Don Julian and was glad to discover in the end that I was right.<br /><br />I actually didn't care much for that part were Andrea is in California.  I didn't find in believable that she managed to fit in there so easily and in so little time.  I don't think a princess who leaves in a mid-evil like era could come to modern California, fit in, learn English, etc all in a few months time.  But, it was necessary to the story.  She learns about who her ancestors could have been (they are suppose to have crossed over from our world centuries ago).<br /><br />An interesting story overall.  I just saw that this is labeled an book 1, so I'm curious as to were the story goes from here.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The courage to remain separate, to think through to the truth is the Power of One", "text": "This is an outstanding epic South African coming of age novel told in the first person by a young English (Rooineks) fatherless lad of five who names himself Peekay. When we first meet up with him just before WWII he is being raised by a Zulu wet nurse because his mother has had a nervous breakdown. Sent to a Boarding School full mostly Boar children (Afrikaners) Peekay learns that he is \"wicked\" and is tried and  tormented by a gang lead by one 12 year old Peekay calls \"the judge\".  The judge comes to symbolize the intolerance of apartheid and the conservative nationalists who implement their anti-black racial polices. Lines like, \"The photograph captures the exact moment when understood with conviction that racism is a primary force of evil designed to destroy good men.\" Courtenay tells Peekay's story in an episodic manner and does at times exhibit the one thing about novels which does bug me which is the number of coincidences or events where the lead character is found to be at the right moment in history. That said, this story is a great beach read (where I read it) and moves along as you grow up along side young Peekay as he learns that an education along with boxing skills sets him on a path to leadership and helps him achieve a kind of revenge on all the judges of the world that would keep him down. He learns the power of one. Peekay says, \"Doc had taught me the value of being the odd man out: the man who senses that there is an essential collective sanity to humans and who assumes the roll of the loner, the thinker, and the searching spirit who calls the privileged and the powerful to task.  The power of one was based on the courage to remain separate, to think through to the truth, and not to be beguiled by convention or the plausible arguments of those who expect to maintain power. There is also a lot of boxing in this story and if I had known that up front I might have passed on reading the book. However, the boxing is not only a good medifore but very well written into the fabric of the narrative. In many cases you almost feel the blow yourself as Peekay attempts to become a champion. And lastly I might note that blacks are a large part of this story but don't take leadership rolls... they are in fact to be protected by their white liberal benefactors which is a bit condescending but I believe reflective of the era that story takes place. If you're in the mood for a great coming of age story with vivid characters and events this might be the perfect read. I certainly enjoyed it a great deal.", "images": [], "asin": "034541005X", "parent_asin": "034541005X", "user_id": "AFB3YSJKSPHVACQYAP5GS7DTGNWA", "timestamp": 1243899062000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Released 16th July 2018, it's 218 pages and available in paperback and ebook formats.<br /><br />This is a cute, undemanding, paranormal cozy. Main character Lily is a photographer and *surprise* a witch. She finds out more about her own and other's powers when a strange Englishwoman appears on her doorstep and drags her off to England to help find her kidnapped brother who, it turns out, is a colleague of the aforementioned woman, exploring crimes with a paranormal angle.<br /><br />The plotting is simple, undemanding, and the plot twists are unlikely to surprise many readers. The dialogue is often silly and/or snarky. There's also a hunky antagonistic detective who provides the necessary slow burn romantic element. I liked reading about the magical elements and the limits of the various characters' talents (they vary).  The denouement was a little surprising; the 'whodunnit' aspect won't come as a shock for many (any?) readers.<br /><br />One quibble from me... It made my eye twitch on page 163 to see the author use \"infer\" when she clearly meant \"imply\".

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good, but not McDermid's best work", "text": "I started reading Val McDermid's novels featuring Dr. Tony Hill after watching the British T.V. drama \"Wire in the Blood,\" which was initially based on that series of books. Even though those novels supplied more cruelty and gore than I would've normally liked, I enjoyed them overall because McDermid 1) presented interesting characters under unusual pressures and 2) kept the plot moving.<br /><br />I like her latest, \"A Darker Domain,\" but am not crazy about it, mainly due to the lack of her normal strengths -- interesting characters and narrative drive -- as the book progressed onward to a not-terribly-surprising ending.<br /><br />This is not a Tony Hill novel but a D.I. Karen Pirie one. The present-day story revolves around two cold cases from the 1980s. The first: the disappearance of a striking (and strike-breaking?) miner; the second: a double kidnapping involving the family of a semi-titan of industry. It becomes evident as the novel progresses that the two cases are in fact tied together, and D.I. Pirie, with the help of reporter Bel Richmond, ultimately solves the puzzle.<br /><br />I have read that McDermid grew up in a mining family and thus has some insight to share regarding the sufferings of the mining community in 1980s Britain. But it seems she might be too close to the topic as it sometimes gets her off course plot-wise and pulls her occasionally into political (and polemical) areas that don't suit the book.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say if you like the author's previous works, you'll like this one. If you haven't yet read McDermid, I'd recommend starting with either the first Tony Hill novel, \"The Mermaids Singing,\" or the non-Tony-Hill novel \"A Place of Execution,\" which might just be her best so far.", "images": [], "asin": "0061688983", "parent_asin": "0061688983", "user_id": "AGYO7XP7YGN5MVWQT2B254GWJD2Q", "timestamp": 1242738525000, "helpful_vote": 27, "verified_purchase": false}

While I agree that it has a David Lynch-esque quality to it, the enjoyment of that characteristic is completely overshadowed by the disjointed manner of story-telling. It never grabs you and pulls you in like a good story; it hops around from past to present before one has a decent grasp of the characters or the proper investment in finding out where the story is going and what's going on. I gave it two stars because the author's turns-of-phrase are evocative and his sentences, as individual entities, are well-crafted.

It\u2019s both familiar and something completely new and wondrous.<br /><br />Aliza Bentaine lives at Merybourne Manor with her parents and sisters\u2026 the manor has recently come under attack by a pack of gryphons, including an attack that took the life of one of her beloved sisters. Aliza is our Elizabeth here\u2026 she\u2019s quiet but loyal and loves her sisters and family, and she would do anything to keep them safe so the loss of her sister is heartbreaking. She\u2019s reassured though when Lord Merybourne decides he has no choice but to hire a group of Riders to come rid the grounds of the gryphons and so arrives Alastair Daired.<br /><br />Alastair is our Darcy equivalent character and dare I say he\u2019s exactly who I had hoped he would be. Descended from a legendary warrior, Edan the Fireborn, he is a dragonmaster and cranky and grumpy and everything you would expect he might be. Of course it doesn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s also handsome. From the get go Alastair and Aliza butt heads and disagree on so many things, but the predicaments they are forced into also build a level of trust and admiration between them.<br /><br />But not only are our main characters well done, the secondary characters are wonderfully developed\u2026 from Master Brysney to Anjey, Leyda & Mari I loved getting to know each of them, and their parts of the story were just as developed as Aliza and Alastair. I also really enjoyed the development of all of the relationships in this story\u2026 from the sisters to the riders, their stories kept me turning pages and again you get hints of P&P here in the relationships that develop, but they are still totally unique!<br /><br />Of course there is some romance\u2026 there are moments you will definitely swoon and if you\u2019re like me, you can\u2019t help but cheer for Aliza and Alastair as they learn that maybe they aren\u2019t the person they originally thought each other were and learn more about what makes them who they are. Let\u2019s just say my shipper heart was super happy\u2026 even if I did want some more kissing.<br /><br />I mentioned that there are dragons in this story and I have to tell you that I loved them\u2026 I loved the history that White has created for them, and I really loved their role in this story. But dragons aren\u2019t the only fantastical creature here\u2026 White introduces us to so many others and the world-building around them was wonderfully done.<br /><br />It makes me sad to say that this is a stand-alone, because I selfishly want more! I will be looking forward to anything that White will be writing in the future. With excellent world-building, action-packed story-telling, and incredibly developed characters and relationships, I\u2019m excited to get this on my all-time favorites bookshelf!", "images": [], "asin": "0062451944", "parent_asin": "0062451944", "user_id": "AEN5SFCSO5L4XDEHZ7B4LYYICXJQ", "timestamp": 1493587046000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Can Christians live without apologists?", "text": "In a nutshell, Ravi Zacharias's Can Man Live Without God is a work whose premise is that we as individuals and as a society need God, the Christian God, to live meaningful lives. The main thrust of the reasoning in this book is that atheism, or \"antitheism\" as Zacharias puts it, is harmful or even deadly. \"Antitheism\" is defined as the denial of God's existence.<br /><br />Some of the key points presented in this book include<br /><br />Material affluence results in \"anguish.\"<br />Living without God makes life unlivable if antitheism is \"consistently carried through.\"<br />Hitler \"lived without God\" which explains his genocidal actions.<br />Stalin's genocide was a result of his being an atheist.<br />Antitheists have no \"rational basis\" for morality.<br />Antitheism provides no solace for hurting people.<br />Antitheistic philosophers like Nietzsche and Russell are at fault for social problems such as divorce.<br />For antitheists, life has no meaning.<br /><br />You can make what you wish of the above assertions, but Zacharias does a good job of writing about the issues raised. His book is interesting and provocative, and he fills its pages with many heart-tugging examples to illustrate some of its most salient points. I found myself taking time out from other activities to read it.<br /><br />Who will like Can Man Live Without God? I'd recommend it to anybody who's interested in the debate waged between atheists and Christians regarding not only the existence of God but how the ideas that may result from belief and disbelief can impact society. I believe that Christians in particular might appreciate this book because it may strengthen their faith when it comes under fire by skeptics.<br /><br />Being a skeptic myself, I unsurprisingly have some criticisms of this work. First and foremost, I must call Zacharias to task for not providing data for his claims. All of the evidence he provides is anecdotal, and anybody with a modicum of scientific knowledge may ask where the statistics are to demonstrate that \"antitheists\" are more likely to be violent or despotic than those who believe in the Christian God.<br /><br />What might possibly be even more obviously amiss with this book is Zacharias not explaining which Gods we presumably cannot live with or without. As a former Hindu, he should be acutely aware that there are more than two viewpoints on the existence of God, atheism and Christianity. What of Jews, Muslims, and Hindus? They have their Gods yet they don't believe in the Christian God. Do they suffer from the same maladies that antitheists allegedly do? If so, then one can believe in God but still be as bad off as Zacharias believes antitheists are. If not, then the Christian God is not necessary to live one's life with morality and meaning.<br /><br />In closing, I'd recommend Can Man Live Without God. It's interesting, provocative, and reflective of the ideological struggle between modern rationalism and traditional Christian belief. It does leave me with a question for debate: Can Christians live without apologists like Zacharias?", "images": [], "asin": "0849945283", "parent_asin": "0849945283", "user_id": "AGOFYFA6354JGAEMQB3Y3M5RCTQA", "timestamp": 1183820092000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

But I checked out the book because Shannon Hale \u2013 and, I suppose, Dean and Nathan Hale, too \u2013 had written it, and I loved (and still love) Shannon Hale. I was charmed by the story and resolved to pick up \u201cCalamity Jack,\u201d the sequel. It\u2019s taken years, but I finally have, and I must say I was underwhelmed. It\u2019s a fun story with some great art, but I wasn\u2019t really into the characters and was only marginally interested in the plot.<br /><br />This graphic novel explains the origins of Jack, Rapunzel\u2019s sidekick, better known to us as the Jack who cut down the beanstalk. Jack\u2019s a good kid \u2013 he thinks. He only wants to help his struggling mother keep her restaurant afloat, but he does it in less than honorable ways \u2013 planning heists, for example, with his fairy friend Prudence. But when he tries to break into a giant\u2019s abode with the help of some magic beans, he ends up fleeing town, meeting up with Rapunzel, and having all the adventures we hear about in \u201cRapunzel\u2019s Revenge.\u201d<br /><br />Now, Jack wants to head home and give his mother the golden eggs he finally got the giant\u2019s goose to lay. However, his old city has been overrun by ant people, and the giant he stole from has seized control. The giant claims he\u2019s the only one who can keep the ant people at bay, but Jack\u2019s gut tells him something funny\u2019s going on, and he\u2019s right. With the help of Rapunzel, Prudence, and a new friend, Frederick Sparksmith the Third, Jack might finally be able to redeem himself.<br /><br />\u201cCalamity Jack\u201d was just as cute as \u201cRapunzel\u2019s Revenge,\u201d but I can\u2019t say I enjoyed it as much. There were more than a few plot points that didn\u2019t make sense, and the characterization, though often amusing, seemed forced this time around. Although it was a fun, breezy read, I was glad for it to be over. Kids who loved the first will likely be all over this one, but I personally preferred the first.", "images": [], "asin": "1599903733", "parent_asin": "1599903733", "user_id": "AE64FRJFR6C3YXZBQQ6WZHEGLWLQ", "timestamp": 1434309932000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Perfect for Curling up on the Sofa with a Cup of Hot Soup", "text": "I picked this up quite by chance one day in the local public library, filling in time as one does. It had a look of promise about it - successful novelist, self help book writer, and respected New York based journalist who has won the Pulitzer Prize - lots going for it. Without being earth shattering or extraordinarily brilliant as one would expect from a writer with such credentials, this is a most comfortable read. Sort of curl up on the couch with your slippers and bowl of hot soup type of read.<br /><br />As it states on the cover this is a memoir. Not an autobiography, or stand-on-the-soapbox-aging-baby-boomer rave. Ms Quindlen is a commentator, using elements of her personal and public lives, to reflect on matters which have been particularly relevant for women of her generation - she is now 60 years old. With themes ranging from being a mum, being a working mum, being a wife, being a daughter, a friend, body image, getting older, this is a book full of reflections and a fair amount of wisdom. The author nursed and lost her mother at a young age. There is a certain sadness in much of the book because of this, and it may well have been the defining event in her life. As a result there is a certain 'take time to smell the roses' thread running through. And there is nothing wrong with that in a book either.<br /><br />It has had mixed reviews in book circles, but I actually found it just a really nice book to read. Here is a woman who was at the vanguard of women 'having it all', who helped lay the foundations for those of us who followed along in her footsteps. Some things went well, some didn't, and she is quite open in her musings.", "images": [], "asin": "0739378554", "parent_asin": "0739378554", "user_id": "AEODGMBI2RFWDPCKQZ2LLWZ75IGQ", "timestamp": 1368525353000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Eat like a Rock Star", "text": "Chris Taylor spends most of his time touring with his band, Grizzly Bear, but musicians have to eat, too.  Turns out, Taylor likes to eat well, cook with friends.  Yes, cook with, not for, friends.  This is a lovely way to bond and minimize some of the stress that comes with entertaining.  You eliminate the need to make things perfect if you cook with, but you do need to have the space/kitchen to allow more cooks in the kitchen.  I simply don't.  I have always dreamed of a large, open kitchen (and a Steinway grand piano), but have always been cursed with a Manhattan galley kitchen.<br /><br />Like Taylor, however, I spend most of time writing, teaching, performing, so when I cook and entertain, I want it to be an enjoyable experience.  Not too stressful.  So I appreciate many of the recipes in here that are meant to inspire.  They tell you in the intro to feel free to tear the book apart, write in the margins, change things around, cross things out.<br /><br />Neither Taylor nor Schori are dssert guys, so credit for the desserts belongs to Lillie O'Brien.<br /><br />The book is divided by seasons.  The photos are lovely and definitely whet your appetite.  The recipes are very friendly and invite improvisation.  The pork chops and charred applesauce looks delicious, and charring the applesauce elevates this dish.  The plating in this book is artistic, and I like their philosophy about plating.  Even though we're all tempted to serve family style when we have big groups of people over with differing diet concerns, Taylor and Schori noticed that people end up eating components separately that way.  Sometimes, flavors pop and foodgasms happen when you mix dishes together.  For example, the sauteed snaps and mushrooms with soft boiled eggs might change how you compose a salad.<br /><br />This is a wonderful cookbook for people who want to enjoy simple satisfying food without the hours and hours of stress.

She is not content to just watch the dvd, drool a little, and then put it away. Jane is obsessed. Her constant failed relationships are proof of that.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wow what an awesome book!", "text": "I think I liked this even better than Circe, which was a surprise because I never really liked the Achilles myth. But now I know why. EVERY other time someone else has retold Achilles in any way he still comes out as an egotistical monster. But this version attempts to give him depth and emotions.<br /><br />We see and learn of Achilles through Patroclus who ends up becoming his childhood companion. They learn, play and spend a lot of time together. He accompanies Achilles to his training with Chiron, where they both finally admit that they have feelings for each other and are attracted to each other.<br /><br />But war is on the horizon, drawing the two away. Achilles mother kidnaps him, forcing him to marry a woman and to bed her, in an attempt to keep Achilles from Troy and from Patroclus. But Patroclus finds him and they are both found by Odysseus and taken to Troy. Achilles knows his fate, that Troy will bring his own death if he kills Hector but he can't imagine why he would.<br /><br />War is awful. Achilles takes to it easily but Patroclus doesn't. Instead he helps as a doctor and helps save the women often taken as slaves. He has no interest in fighting until Achilles lets his own pride in the way, costing people their lives and safety. Patroclus comes up with a plan, with Achilles approval, he will dress up as Achilles and unite the men in show only and Achilles can keep his promise to not fight until an apology is given to him. But Hector kills Patroclus anyway, even though he can tell he isn't Achilles. Achilles takes revenge and thus cements his own death.<br /><br />What is even more sad is how no one will honor Patroclus in his death. Their ashes are mingled but Achilles stupid son won't let them carve Patroclus name on the monument because he refuses to acknowledge that his father was gay. Patroclus begs Odysseus to fix things, but he can't. Achilles own mother ends up carving Patroclus name and reuniting them in the afterlife.<br /><br />Achilles has his ego and he definitely is imperfect. Patroclus is great. Most of the other men suck to some degree and Achilles mother is awful because honestly if she hadn't hated Patroclus so much maybe the story would have had a different ending.

Nice printing, dark and large enough to be easily seen and the book opens easily and will stay open on my music stand with the use of wooden clothespins.<br /><br />I'm not exactly thrilled with the tunes however.  I wanted \"Ballads\" but I took a chance on this book hoping for some much older tunes, so I'm kind of disappointed about that.  And I don't like over half of the tunes anyway so there's only a few I might use.  It's not a bad book, but the melodies are very simplified and in some situations with these type of books I often will change the notation a bit to give the tune more flare. But, they're o.k. the way they are.  There are no exotic key signatures to deal with, most have just one sharp with no more than three, and no flatted keys, so the sight-reading isn't all that challenging.  Some left-hand fingering suggestions are given in the notation but not in the TAB section.  Actually, nothing extra is given in the TAB - only what fret on what string.  You'll have to look at the notation to determine your timing, which is a good reason, among MANY to go ahead and learn to read standard notation. (o.k. rant over. I teach classical guitar so I'm sort of biased against TAB).  No right-hand fingerings are given but for those who have studied classical guitar, this book should present no problems in either area, LH or RH.", "images": [], "asin": "0634098934", "parent_asin": "0634098934", "user_id": "AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ", "timestamp": 1247686041000, "helpful_vote": 47, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Classic Liberal Review: Proofiness is a bit Proofy.", "text": "This book is politically loaded, so let me jump right out here so you all know where I'm coming from (and that I'm not trying to hoodwink anyone). I am a Classic Liberal or Lockean/Madisonian. So with that in mind I'm not a Republican or Democrat, and like to see people held accountable for their lies (or abuse of information).<br /><br />First, I'd like to say that the book started off quite fun and interesting. Seife is light with the mathematics (a bit of a downer for an engineering student like me), but he still pulls off a relatively decent explanation of numbers, systems of measurements, and the like. The first half is very accessible; it is at worst entertaining, at best, clever. Some other reviewers took issue with the neologisms, I personally didn't mind them, but perhaps being an educated late-20s, I am perhaps the target market for this kind of writing?<br /><br />However, as it got further into the book, Seife started violating some of his own implicit rules (such as: Journalists are unbiased, or should strive to be if possible.).  This made the book incredibly distracting and not particularly fun to read towards the end. Personally I would argue that chapters 7 & 8 got out of hand. For example, in closing out chapter 7 he states,<br /><br />\"The sheer number of errors in our courts make the finality of an execution-of an irreversible mistake-hard to justify. The only way around that hard fact is to pretend it isn't so.\"<br /><br /> Wait a second, I thought Seife was trying to show me how people are abusing numbers to push agendas, right? So why is he saying this? It couldn't be that he is an opponent of capital punishment, could it? I mean, he's the mathematician, and he just educated me on how a pro-capital punishment fellow tried to trick us, so therefore the opposite conclusion (anti-capital punishment) must be correct! Seriously... a \"false dilemma\" (also called \"either-or\" fallacy)? Goodness I don't even hold a bachelor's yet and I can see through that over simplification.<br /><br />Later in chapter 8 he brings up some nonsense about a study that compared a Toyota Prius to Hummers. I do tend to agree that the study was conducted to make the Hummer brand look favorable, so I won't even try to argue against intent. I think most will agree that Hummers probably don't rate very high on the scale of being \"green.\"  However, Seife decided to take a detour anyways through a small evaluative argument right in the middle of chapter 8 without much backing. He states,<br /><br />\"(This was nothing compared to the Hummer H1, which would be on the road for an incredible 34.96 years and 379,000 miles on average.) These are clear Potemkin numbers-there's no way that the typical Hummer H1 would last for nearly 400,000 miles-and they have the effect of inflating the energy efficiency of the Hummers and deflating the energy efficiency of the Prius.\"<br /><br />Now, I don't doubt the goal of the study was to make the Hummer look more \"green\" than it actual was, especially because it was compared to a \"green\" auto icon. However, the statement that there is \"no way that the typical Hummer H1 would last for nearly 400,000 miles\" is completely unfounded. I have found the reverse to be true. I used HMMWVs (aka humvees) in the Marine Corps. The difference between a Hummer H1 and HMMWV is streetability, mostly cosmetic differences. Functionally they are the same vehicle. Many of the HMMWVs we used were mid to late 80s models; the infantry usually got the newer stuff. Our models had in many cases in excess of 500K miles, there were a few dinosaurs lying around in awful shape near the 1 million mark. My point here is that Seife probably had a reasonable conclusion (that Hummers are less \"green\" than Prius). But he was so hasty in getting to his point to show that pundits had abused the data (also likely reasonable and true), that he made some mistakes with the premise along the way. If he had shot down the study just by simply pointing out that the average auto consumer buys a new car once every 3 - 5 years, and given that length of time, likely that no Hummer would ever match the efficiency of a Prius, this would have been reasonable.<br /><br />To summarize, I found the book readable and interesting. I thought it started great and ended horribly. I'm under the impression that Seife leans very Democratic but the writing strikes me as being just left of center. It's worth at least one read, but whether as a permanent addition to your collection or just a library rental I leave to you.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not all that I'd hoped...", "text": "This year we switched to this curriculum, Christian Kids Explore Biology, and I tried again to find a Christian science curriculum that we would like and that would be easy to use.<br /><br />I liked the philosophy of this author and many of the points she draws out in the lessons.  But, unfortunately, after two lessons, I quickly realized that there were lots of holes in the curriculum and it was difficult for my kids to follow auditorily.  There is no student book and the text would be way above their reading level if I were to copy it for them (which isn't legal since the text portion of the book isn't reproducible).  I worked through several lessons and assembled additional materials and supplements so that the curriculum would be what I thought it should be.<br /><br />Here's a quick example.  Instead of clearly saying, &#34;There are two types of cells:  Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic.  Animal and Plant cells are both eukaryotic, but they have some differences.&#34;  The book says on page 8, &#34;Eukaryotic cells have a particular organelle inside called the nucleus...  and on pg. 9, &#34;Some cells do not have a nucleus.  They are called prokaryotic.&#34;  No examples are given of what a prokaryotic cell would be.  Then the assignment asks kids to label an animal cell and a plant cell, before first saying that both of these cells are eukaryotic because they have a nucleus.  That was Lesson 2 in Unit 1.  Honestly, I love the stuffing of this curriculum, but there just isn't enough of it and there are statements that are missing so that me (a non-science lover) can teach it easily.  I was constantly running to the internet so that I could thoroughly explain the lessons to my kids.  I had to clarify that there weren't more than two types of cells.  I also wanted my kids to know the word &#34;mitosis&#34; which wasn't mentioned in the lesson at all.<br /><br />So, where does that leave me?  The reason I had switched because of my concerns about evolution and natural selection and how that teaching permeates secular science curriculum.  I've looked for a curriculum that I like as well as Harcourt Science.  Now I've tried two and have looked at many others.  But Harcourt Science works for my kids and it works for me.  As my oldest daughter said to me today.  Mommy, &#34;I know creation is the truth, but I like this book and how it teaches.&#34;  So, I'm switching back through 6th grade and will find another curriculum to use for 7th grade and beyond...<br /><br />As a side note, make sure you either get a copy of this book with a cd of the reproducible pages or you purchase a download of the reproducibles from the publisher's webpage if you're going to use this curriculum.

I can't go on about it, except I suppose I can joke that if the effect of browsing this book isn't the same as Zoloft, it's pretty close.<br /><br />There are some cartoons that have stuck in my mind for years and I'd forgotten how many had come from the New Yorker.  Here are a few examples.<br /><br />1.  Two hippos are standing in a river, staring at a gazelle on the bank.  Says one hippo:  &#34;I hate her.&#34;<br /><br />2.  Panel one.  A man is drowning in a rushing river and shouts to a collie on the shore, &#34;Lassie -- go get help!&#34;  Panel two.  Lassie is on a psychoanalyst's couch, waving her paws, while the shrink takes notes.<br /><br />3.  One snail says to another snail wearing a badge.  &#34;He went that way, sheriff, but you'll never catch him!&#34;  The escapee snail is about as distant from the others as the witness snail is from the sheriff snail.<br /><br />They're surprisingly undated because almost all of them deal with situations that are eternally relevant.  They aren't political cartoons; they're just cartoons.  Well, when I use the word &#34;undated&#34;, I mean for many of us.  I'm not sure some of the earlier ones will be grasped by those of little interest in different Zeitgeists.<br /><br />4.  In 1946, a young man, presumably a veteran, is smiling happily at the desk of a bank loan manager, saying, &#34;I'm so grateful for the loan.  I don't know how I can ever repay you.&#34;<br /><br />Most will make you smile.  A few will crack you up.

But it's told in the first person, and the narrator's  voice is monotonal - and ultimately monotonous.  As to what that tone is, I'll quote Lila, from Marilynn Robinson's (much better) book of that name: &#34;[He looked] at every single thing in the world as if it had a price tag on it and he knew it wasn't worth half that much because he could see what the paint hid, where the rot was.&#34; (p 243). And so it is here.  There's a lot of pithy criticism and acute social observation, but it wears thin and isn't enough to carry a 384-page book.

I've read his work before and it's good, so I was looking forward to reading this story, too.  I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Blue used to be a cop but ended up resigning when he shot an unarmed woman during a drug raid.  His ex-partner, Harry, still thinks he got a get out of jail free card and resents him.  Lou has his office above the bar and is operating on his own after his last office job almost cost him his life.

Wedded to her routine, she is slowly acclimating to life after being abducted and held captive for four years. After six years of therapy with a psychologist who pioneered her treatment, she is gradually gaining confidence and a tentative sense of independence and control. But all that is threatened when her therapist asks her to speak to a young victim of a similar crime. After reluctantly agreeing she becomes drawn into an investigation of similar cases. With intelligence and grit, she confronts her fears and limitations to vanquish an insidious evil.<br /><br />The story is chilling and Reeve is a heroine to love. She is bright and refreshingly honest. Her romantic dilemma is handled with sensitivity and she is a strong and believable character. There were a few missteps. The prosecutor was a one dimensional harpy. I doubt very much that an experienced and ambitious politician would be as obnoxious to a victim of a horrific sex crime as she was to Reeve.  The therapist who has supported her  evaporates mid story, supposedly beset by personal problems and professional commitments. The subplot of Reeve's attacker applying for release from prison was poorly developed and distracting. I found Reeve's introduction in the investigation implausible. It seems that someone further along in the recovery process would be invited to commiserate with a new victim. Still, this is a fascinating and spine chilling read.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Epic Alternative Historical Fantasy", "text": "I've just finished reading the whole of this series, and so will write a review on that basis, beginning with the prequel.  This is a totally captivating series.  I wasn't sure, when I picked up the first one, whether I would become all that interested in Welsh medieval history. No worries there.  The author is a scholar in this field, and knows this history completely.  In these books, she hypothesizes about what would have happened if certain events had not taken place, or had taken place differently.  In short, she rewrites Welsh history.  In a very satisfying way.<br /><br />The world of these books is not simply a reimagining of history.  She includes time travel, and other paranormal stuff.  It all makes perfect sense, though, and you very quickly come to accept the premise.  Although she never attempts to explain how these things happen, it doesn't seem to matter.<br /><br />I also like the way she wove the King Arthur myths into this story.  I wasn't aware that she was doing that until the second or third book, and it was a great pleasure to recognize the theme.<br /><br />Her characters are flesh and blood.  We come to care about them fast, and understand their motivations.  In particular, she spends time on detailing the motivations of the secondary adversarial figures, as well as the leads.  This gives her books a depth that you don't always see, especially in books that are classified as YA.  These books are most definitely crossovers.  They will appeal to all adults.  The writing is mature enough, and the issues and events feel very real.<br /><br />I don't know whether the author intends to write any further about these characters.  I loved them, and would like to see that happen.  She's ended her story here, in a way that allows you to move on, even while wanting more.  I'd recommend these books to just about anyone who likes fiction with a fantasy angle.  Despite the time spent on the history, it is not dry.  The author has created a world that is blazingly alive.<br /><br />I went back and forth about the rating, wanting to give it a \"5 Star\", but, since I couldn't decide, gave it \"4\".  There were some aspects of the story that didn't feel completely finished.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "One helluva good read. Highly recommended", "text": "EPITAPH: A NOVEL OF THE O.K. CORRAL is the third Mary Doria Russell book I've read. The first was [[ASIN:081298000X Doc: A Novel]], all about Doc Holliday's early life and how he met the Earps. Then I read [[ASIN:0345485556 Dreamers of the Day: A Novel]], an historical novel framed by the 1921 Cairo Peace Conference. EPITAPH returns us once again to the Earp brothers and the American West of the early 1880s, this time not Dodge City, but Tombstone and the O.K. Corral, and we all know what happened there. Or we thought we did if we grew up in the 50s and 60s and watched all those dumb Wyatt Earp TV shows starring Hugh O'Brien, and then a lot of movies about the O.K. Corral. (Actually I've only seen one of them, the Henry Fonda one, MY DARLING CLEMENTINE.) But after reading DOC and its encyclopedic look at Holliday's early life and the world he lived in, I have come to respect Russell's slant on things. She researches and researches and then researches some more, and then turns all that research into some of the most eminently readable and intelligent novels I've ever encountered. And EPITAPH, her latest, is no exception. While the subtitle indicates it's about the O.K. Corral showdown, readers will quickly discover that the shootout itself - which Russell tells us first thing lasted probably no more than half a minute tops - is merely the axis upon which a much larger story turns, and it is, like DOC, a roller-coaster of a page-turner which, not incidentally, also gives you a fascinating look at the politics of the 1880s and how that gunfight fit into the larger scheme of things.<br /><br />We learn, for example, that the Tombstone story played out during the short, tragic presidency of James Garfield, a professor of Greek and Latin at tiny Hiram College in Ohio, and a reluctant candidate who gave his party \"warning that he would do nothing to gain the office ... He'd kept his word too, traveling no farther than his own front porch during the campaign.\" When Garfield died from wounds inflicted by an assassin, his VP, Chester Arthur, proved to be a weak, ineffectual and fearful successor. And this is only a small part of the historical frame Russell provides for her saga of the Earps and Holliday. The border tensions between the Arizona Territory and Mexico, fueled by cattle thieves and outlaws, also figure into the story, as do the devious and crooked politics of the times. Wyatt Earp and his brothers, all lawmen, fall victim to these politics, and the resulting actions are reminiscent of the recent racial tensions and grand jury investigations of police officers in Missouri and New York. In this respect, the larger story of the O.K. Corral becomes relevant and timely, even though it happened over a hundred and thirty years ago.<br /><br />So yes, Russell knows her history and uses it to her best advantage. But she is also incredibly skilled at bringing these real historical figures to life. And not just the Earps and their women, but also the other lawmen and townspeople. Even the villains become real - the two McLaury brothers (one a gentle farmer, the other a blowhard troublemaker), the Clantons (the brutal, abusive patriarch; the fearful, damaged older son, Ike; and the wild younger son, Billy), and the notorious psychopath, Johnny Ringo; as well as a large cast of minor characters both good and bad. But after Wyatt and Doc, perhaps the most fascinating figure here is the woman who came to love Wyatt and stayed with him for over forty years, Josie \"Sadie\" Marcus.<br /><br />Hey, I could go on and on about this book, but I'd better not. It's a pretty damn good one though. If I had any problem at all with the book it would be that the first couple hundred pages (it runs nearly 600 pages), which, while  filled with interesting historical stuff, may have lumbered just a bit. In fact the best part of the book comes after the gunfight - the political fallout and betrayals, when the police officers - the Earps and Holliday - are painted as vicious killers and are arrested and tried. Sound familiar? Well, I told ya. And then there are the later years of Wyatt Earp, years of wandering from place to place, trying to escape his storied past.<br /><br />EPITAPH is one helluva good read. I suspect it may be the most complete and accurate look at the famous gunfight, the events that precipitated it, and the aftermath ever written. And it's also a great 'docu-novel' of the life of Wyatt Earp. Probably the best book of that sort I've read since Darryl Ponicsan's [[ASIN:0440059690 Tom Mix died for your sins: A novel based on his life]]. It's always a difficult and touchy task to fictionalize the life of a real historical personage. Ponicsan did it well with the colorful Tom Mix. And now so has Mary Doria Russell with Wyatt Earp.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent--a well written look at global migration/refugee issues--and solutions. Thought-provoking.", "text": "This book was written before the world learned that the U.S. government had forcibly and often with no warning, taken thousands of children from their parents. This was done with no plans to reunite them and justified as a \"deterrent\" to other migrants fleeing violence in Central America.<br /><br />What a tragedy. The world has more refugees now--60 million, nearly half of them children--than at any time in history. And yet our current government is focused on creating false reasons to fear them, rather than giving humane reasons to help them.<br /><br />The current administration may have learned nothing from history, but Jacqueline Bhabha has. This is a factual book about migration, but also a philosophical book about morality and ethics. She first analyzes the situation world-wide (the \"problem\"), then asks the questions that humane societies should ask themselves about what is realistic to do? What is our individual and collective responsibility? She explains the laws that apply to international refugee migration as well as so-called \"economic migration\", for hardship. She reminds us that \"the primary drivers of distress migration are conflict, natural disasters and climate change, global inequality and demographic changes\" adding, \"no solution to the current refugee and immigration crisis can be found solely by addressing its most evident symptoms.\" (p113).<br /><br />Hers is a global perspective with global solutions suggested. She looks at the world-wide refugee migration trends and what nations can do, including through the United Nations. It is a broad view, not just focused on the United States, but very important for the United States, caught in a moral crisis. She pays attention to the effect of this situation on a young generation of millions of refugees--what will they grow into, left as they are in the refuse camps of the world, deprived of education and the basic essentials of existence that most of the world enjoys?<br /><br />Bhabha doesn't just describe the problems--which she does very well--she takes on the solutions, an array of very specific ones. This is a small book--only 132 pages--but its an important one. It's a call to conscience that includes real-world recommendations for ways to help.

While petite Evaline is physically strong and highly impulsive, ready at a moment\u2019s notice to barge in bashing heads and staking hearts, ungainly Mina is instead methodical in temperament, analytical in thinking, and clumsy in movement.<br /><br />In spite of their differences, Mina and Evaline are both intent on unmasking and capturing The Ankh, an evil villainess they\u2019ve been chasing since the first book, but Irene Adler (boss to Mina and Evaline, and \u201cThe Woman\u201d to Mina\u2019s Uncle Sherlock) and  Princess Alexandra have asked (ordered) them to spend their time chaperoning Princess Lurelia of Betrovia instead.The highly delicate diplomatic situation between Betrovia and Britain dates back to Elizabeth I and involves love, betrayal, secret treasure, and the mysterious missing piece of an elaborate chess set. It\u2019s important that Princess Lurelia be coddled and protected at all costs lest the two countries have another falling out, but the Princess is attacked almost at once, at the ball in her honor of her visit.<br /><br />This series is silly, suspenseful, occasionally moving, and a lot of fun. I love the sometimes irritated banter between Mina and Evaline, and I enjoy seeing the world through their very different perspectives. I really adore the setting. The the two young women inhabit a colorful, Victorian, steam-powered London that would make a great travel destination. It\u2019s a city layered with multi-leveled walkways connected by coin-driven mechanical lifts that keep those who are short on funds down below. While the higher levels of this London are amazing, gleaming, and gorgeous, complete with clever clockwork devices, animated twinkling lights, and the opulent upper floors of  skyscrapers so tall they have large balloons to act as air anchors, the lower levels of the city are dirty, dank and dark, and the haunt of criminals.<br /><br />The Chess Queen Enigma doesn\u2019t end in a cliffhanger, but several things are left unresolved, leading me to hope there will be a fourth book. I read an ebook advanced review copy of this book supplied by the publisher through Edelweiss.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Looking At Art For The Predominant Colors Used & The Feelings They Emote", "text": "Art Unfolded: A History of Art in Four Colours made me feel as if I was attending one of the author- Ben Street\u2019s lectures in London. This is a small book- 6 \u00bd\" by 5\" with a mere 42 pages and also having 4 pullout pages that hold a dozen paintings each showcasing the four colors explained.  Each of the dozen paintings for the four different colors also has a full page detailing the artist\u2019s background, the times and the predominant colors used. The paintings chosen were from Western civilization\u2019s great artists from the 14th to 20th centuries, and were chosen for this book from London\u2019s National Gallery.<br /><br />The book is divided into four main chapters- the first being- Blue Is The Colour Of Longing. This chapter showcases some beautiful art that feature many shades of blue. The author explains because blue recedes, it is perfect for infinite horizons. I especially loved Sassoferrato\u2019s The Virgin In Prayer from 1640. I don\u2019t see blue as the color of longing, but of serenity, comfort, soft beauty and peacefulness. The second chapter is Red Is The Oldest Colour. So named because of the oldest paintings on cave walls were painted in red. The author explains red is the color of blood and red always advances in art. As I studied the red paintings, I see red as big, bold and showy as in Kazimir Malevich\u2019s Red Square from 1915. One thing is certain, you cannot ignore red.<br /><br />The third chapter is Green Is The Slipperiest Of Colours. By Slipperiest the author means changing from one thing to the next. As he states green can be new life or sickly or even jealousy. There are so many shades of green that even adding a bit more yellow can change the feeling from bright and fresh to dying. I absolutely love Claude Monet\u2019s The Water-Lily Pond from 1899. His green colors speak to me of being very alive, earthy and primal. The fourth and last chapter is Gold Radiates Divinity And Luxury. The author states no other color represents wealth and power as gold does. Viewing the twelve paintings in this chapter I see gold as being big, cheerful and bright. I especially love Gustav Klimt\u2019s The Kiss from 1907. He makes me feel that love is so bright and touching with his use of gold. This tiny little book packs a big perspective for the lover of art (and I was an art major)- you will forever look at not just the subject matter in art, but at the predominant colors used and the feelings they emote. 5 STARS.", "images": [], "asin": "1781575622", "parent_asin": "1781575622", "user_id": "AENQC6O3X4BUEQWSDTBUN2VMM5VQ", "timestamp": 1541748568133, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Poetry from the heart", "text": "Reaching for Dawn by Ann Christine Tabaka is a collection of poems that are rich with clear images. The reader is on firm footing throughout, able to feel and understand all aspects of the speaker\u2019s reflections in each poem in this collection. As I read Reaching for Dawn, I felt the highs and many lows the poems\u2019 persona experienced. Such clear writing is to be admired in modern poetry. Academic poetry tends to obscure meaning, eschewing plainness for artiness, urbanity for folksiness. Ann\u2019s strength is in her very plain poems and, as those of us raised in small towns can attest, there are folk remedies which work just as well or better than technically-advanced ones and many people prefer folk art more than they do high art. In the folk quality of many of her finest poems, Ann Christine Tabaka excels.<br /><br />When Ann tries artistic tricks, she fails. This is not a bad thing, for it reveals that her magic is not in trickery but in truth, in plainness, in coming forward with her messages clearly and not trying to dress them up in whatever vogue is of-the-moment. To be timeless, a work of art needs to speak directly to the heart, not to the tastes of the times in which the piece was crested. Reaching for Dawn\u2019s best poems will speak to readers long after the author has passed-on.<br /><br />There is much sadness in Reaching for Dawn. In several poems we have flowers/petals falling to the ground/the floor, a symbol of sorrow and/or the harsh passage of time. We also have repeated occurrences of lonely nights, feelings of isolation, and bewilderment. We have all had such feelings, helping to give the poems meaning for readers. But as the persona of the poems suffers through the bewilderment, loss, loneliness, sadness, and time\u2019s cold grip, I am still left wondering if the reach is really for dawn or for some other form of relief, for won\u2019t dawn just lead to more of the same sad aspects of life, a new day or trials and not a day of triumph?<br /><br />The final two pages of Reaching for Dawn give the reader hope that the persona as a chance, at least, of triumph. In \u201cA New Day Dawns\u201d we see the persona start the day shaking off yesterday and last night full of finger-crossed hope that a better day is ahead. Then, in all caps and surprisingly large print Ann gives the admonition that a poem is sometimes just a poem and, in effect, that the reader should not assume the deeper messages they have just read are really all that deep, all that true after all. Some poems, Ann writes, may well be true, some may not be, which now leaves the reader to wonder WHICH of the poems that Ann wrote ARE true and which are not, which show her real feelings and experiences, and which do not. It\u2019s not a coquettish wink, for she has stoked-up and revealed quite honest emotions. It\u2019s more a seeming discomfort that the reader may assume that she has gone through what the persona of the poems has gone through. It\u2019s maybe a reassurance that Ann herself is fine and just writing poetry in Delaware, that the reader need not worry about her.<br /><br />Let\u2019s hope that this is the case and that we\u2019ll get many more poems from Ann Christine Tabaka.", "images": [], "asin": "1986797104", "parent_asin": "1986797104", "user_id": "AGHB765FVRI3UXYJFKGJFH4PKLLQ", "timestamp": 1542860339055, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Redirecting Classical Economics", "text": "David Ricardo played a crucial role in developing Classical Economics. Ricardo was prompted to write on economics by reading The Wealth of Nations. As luck would have it, Ricardo knew James Mill (father of JS Mill) and was soon in contact with TR Malthus. The debates between Ricardo and Malthus produced a paradigm that lasted only a half a century. PPE+T is a central part of the Classical paradigm, it is Ricardo's definitive statement on economics.<br /><br />PPE+T is perhaps the most tightly reasoned book written by a Classical economists (JS Mill is a close rival here). This is not fun reading but it is important as a piece of history, and elements of Ricardo's analysis remain relevant today. Given Ricardo's razor sharp intellect, one must wonder why he did not develop modern value theory himself. The tight reasoning of this book is, ironically, the source of much criticism against it. Joseph Schumpeter (among others) has lamented `the Ricardian vice', by which Ricardo arrived at policy conclusions through flawless but restrictive logical reasoning. Ricardo is hard to argue against, given his assumptions, but what if we alter these assumptions?<br /><br />While Classical Economics is dead, some of its Ricardian elements live on. The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation remains relevant today largely because of Ricardo's concept of Comparative Advantage. Comparative Advantage is one of the most enduring ideas in economics. The development of the Comparative Advantage concept set Ricardo ahead of all but a few of his contemporaries. Economists still speak of Ricardian Equivalence and The Ricardo Effect. While some might object Ricardo's logical-deductive approach to political economy, few economists have stood the test of time so well. PPE+T is a timeless classic. This is not fun reading, but it is important none the less.", "images": [], "asin": "0486434613", "parent_asin": "0486434613", "user_id": "AFFTBEFXJ6OINQY2S5VBBQ3P3VZQ", "timestamp": 1211293875000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "More about long-lasting women's friendships than a traditional holiday novel", "text": "This book seemed right up my alley--I love to bake and I love Christmas!  However, when I started reading it, I discovered that it is really more about women's friendships.  As the title suggests, the novel revolves around a cookie club that has been in place for about 15 years.  The narrator of the story is Marnie, otherwise known as the head cookie b*tch (yes, that is exactly what she is called in the book--and the overuse of this phrase gets a bit grating as the book goes on).  Marnie and eleven of her friends meet every year on the first Monday of December to exchange a baker's dozen cookies--twelve dozen with each other, and one dozen donated to their locate hospice.  The rules are quite strict, but the party itself is supposed to be fun, and most of the women look forward to it all year long.<br /><br />So that's the setup for the club.  The setup for the book itself is that author Ann Pearlman highlights the background story of each of the group's members separately in each chapter, beginning logically with Marnie.  But first, Pearlman opens the chapter by offering the cookie recipe which that particular club member has brought to the party that year.  Given the rules of no chocolate chip (too common) and no bars (too messy), these recipes are unique and different, and I definitely hope to try a few of them.  Although I thought the recipes added to the story, I didn't like how Pearlman ended each chapter.  Here she provides educational information on the history of various baking ingredients--for example, flour, nuts, vanilla, salt, etc.  These short descriptions would have been appropriate in a cookbook, but they seem truly out of place in a novel.<br /><br />Finally, a note about the stories of the women themselves.  I definitely did enjoy reading the lives of each of these women unfold between the pages of the book, but other readers should be forewarned:  this is NOT an uplifting Christmas book!  Each and every one of the women of the club experiences a life that is marked by trauma and tragedy, to the point where it seemed like Pearlman went a bit overboard.  There is true grief and loss within the first chapter, so those who aren't looking for that kind of read might want to save this book until after the holidays or skip it altogether.  A final issue in reading this novel is that with twelve women in the group--not to mention former members, husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, children, etc.--it was sometimes difficult to keep everyone straight!<br /><br />Although there were a few things that I did not like about this book (as mentioned above), overall I did enjoy it, and I would recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "1439158843", "parent_asin": "1439158843", "user_id": "AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA", "timestamp": 1259422845000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Enjoyable", "text": "\"Too Close to Home\" is a fast-paced romantic suspense novel. The characters were likable and realistic, and the romance was very nicely done and realistically awkward at times. The world-building was good, but in a few places I questioned if the police, FBI, or EMS really would do things that way in real life (like an ambulance taking away a dead body when wounded living still needed help).<br /><br />The suspense was high, but I didn't really enjoy it in the first part because the main characters kept doing foolish things that put them in danger (like they tried to get the killer to come after them and Samantha was nearly killed at her home, yet she went to stay with her sister without taking any security precautions). But this wasn't a problem in the second part. Also, the bad guy in this novel was clever, and the case was very interesting.<br /><br />The killer was one of the point of view characters and the author didn't try very hard to conceal his identity, so I realized who he was a long time before our heroes did. While this did create some suspense, it also made me frustrated that our heroes took so long to pay attention to the clues that were now especially obvious to me.<br /><br />There were several Christians in the novel. Christians were portrayed realistically, with both the good and bad shown. The character's beliefs were worked in as a meaningful part of their lives. I really liked how this was handled. The novel wasn't preachy, and it didn't settle for the pat answers for evil and suffering but went deeper.<br /><br />There was no sex and no bad language.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "An interesting and intellectual contrary opinion", "text": "Robert Woodson Sr. Is the founder and President of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise (NCNE) It emphasizes the importance of self empowerment and self management approaches for ending poverty.  Woodson worked for the National Urban League, and he was a research fellow with the American Enterprise Institute before leaving, in 1981, to found NCNE.<br /><br />Woodson, and the individual essay writers he has gathered here, acknowledge endemic hindrances to Black achievement  in the United States.  Their main focus, however, is in describing how young Black Americans can use their own personal, real, abilities to raise themselves out of the negative consequences of the generational failure that seems to permeate Black life in the United States.<br /><br />Simply put, stop thinking of yourself as a \u201cvictim\u201d, doomed to failure.  You are not!  You will only fail if you live your life as a victim, blaming others for your perceived failures.  Even with the negative consequences of slavery, and Jim Crow and Segregation, seeing yourself as a \u201cvictim\u201d, and blaming fate and others for your position in life, doesn\u2019t make you strong.  In fact, it makes you weak.  It makes you even more dependent on the \u201cgenerosity\u201d, the magnanimity, of politicians and \u201chustlers\u201d who make their living\u2014a very good one, too\u2014promising Black Americans to raise them out of the situation in which they find themselves.<br /><br />To me, accepting this line of thinking is a fascinating event, because the same people, or their fathers before them, have been promising Black Americans\u2014I\u2019ll call it\u2014salvatio if they only vote, and support, them.  This has been going on for over sixty years.  Nothing, in all that time, seems to have changed-except the collapse of the Black family and the general failure of Black education.  Following that line of thinking, in short, has ended badly.<br /><br />Anyway, the book\u2019s essays are well thought out, intellectually honest, and are an honest response to the current \u201csalvation\u201d method:  Critical Race Theory (CRT).  It\u2019s definitely a motivating, worthwhile, read\u2014even though it will, probably, not overcome the current racial grand issue (CRT), it does intelligently describe another way.<br /><br />But, after all is said and done, I\u2019m a caucasian, so I probably shouldn\u2019t be believed as far as the way out of poverty is concerned.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "One of the better Land Rover books", "text": "I feel this is one of the best Land Rover books I've read. Martin Hodder was the editor and owner of Land Rover Owner Magazine and is a true Land Rover enthusiast. Plus, given his position he has had ample opportunities to drive and experience a wide range of Land Rover vehicles, rub elbows with L/R engineers and insiders, and work with club members and other enthusiasts, which is immediately evident in the detail and knowledge of his writing.<br /><br />The book covers Land Rovers beginning with the background and development of the 1970 Range Rover, which is the basic platform for the Defender and Discovery and describes the Freelander. It illustrates some of the more unusual Land Rover variants like certain 6-wheel vehicles and some odd-ball military one-offs. He also dives into the corporate thinking and development stages of the Defender and Discovery vehicles, as well as the Freelander. I don't know if there is a later version, but the book I have goes up to 1998. Therefore it's limited to vintage Land Rovers up until that time.<br /><br />The book is divided into the following categories: The family of Land Rovers; A legend is born; Land Rovers at play; Let's go off-roading; Ranger Rover - The inside story of a world beater (this is a rather fascinating account by a key Land Rover engineer Geoff Miller, who led the engineering team that created the Range Rover and describes his account of how the Range Rover came to be starting in the mid-60's and other vehicles they looked at during the evaluation phases); Camel Trophy, the ultimate test (how Land Rover became the defacto vehicles used in the Camel Trophy and what it meant to them); The unbeatable Defender (why and how it came to be); The mighty V8 (the how and why Rover picked up the GM aluminum V8 in the 60's); The Dunsfold treasure (Land Rover historical vehicles collection); Land Rovers on parade; Chosing and buying a Land Rover.<br /><br />I've read a number of Land Rover enthusiast books and each seems to take a slightly different angle and fills in a different piece of the L/R history. This book is a great background-type book. What you won't find in this version is anything on the DII's, off-road driving techniques, specific how-to's for modifying your Land Rover (there are other books for that).<br /><br />In my mind, chapter 5: Range Rover - the inside story of a world-beater, (this chapter written by Geoff Miller of Land Rover engineering), is among the most revealing and interesting 25 pages of any L/R book I've ever read. It pretty much sums up that Land Rover was heavily influenced by the, then new, Ford Bronco which pioneered the widespread use of front coil springs and long, cast iron connecting arms. This seems to be something Land Rover fans think was a hat trick pulled out of thin air by Land Rover. The engineers tested the Bronco, IH Scout and some other vehicles and wisely cherry-picked the best set of features to come up with a dynamite off-roader (Range Rover). It sounds like the rear A-frame was something they did design.<br /><br />I wish there had been more information on specific changes and improvements Rover made to the GM V8 after they purchased it, that helped it be the extremely smooth and robust engine it eventually became. There are internet sights devoted to this but it would be good to see it pulled together in a book format.<br /><br />Overall, if you are into Land Rovers, I highly recommend.<br /><br />Note: James Taylor (British Journalist) also has some good books, particularly on the Discovery, if you are into the Discos. They have a lot of 'in the making' photos that are fun to look at along with detailed insider information. Ralph Hosier's How to modify Land Rover Vehicles is another good book as is Jack Jackson's Off-Road and 4 wheel Drive Book. Jack Jackson is an obvious Land Rover fan and outlines countless factors to consider in when considering long-range off-roading in developing countries. A lot of tips and techniques that are transferable for any kind of off-roading.", "images": [], "asin": "1859604374", "parent_asin": "1859604374", "user_id": "AERVDB5CM2FVGSQBTBIXZV6DKMFQ", "timestamp": 1418081008000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

It is a fascinating character study in which the author makes the best use of his ability to create worlds and situations far removed from typical experience.  Science fiction makes demands that many authors fail to appreciate; however, Mr. Banks appropriately respects the forms and tells a remarkable tale of a warrior seeking absolution.<br /><br />Mr. Banks takes interesting liberties with narrative flow--this book is not a casual read.  Instead, it makes demands and richly rewards the careful reader with the kind of perspective shift that is the hallmark of truly excellent science fiction.<br /><br />Like Dune or Lord of the Rings, Mr. Banks has constructed a believable world so complete in itself that the background becomes part of the plot.  Use of Weapons revolves around the issue of what happens when civilization and technology transcend money--what makes life worth living?  How should almost omnipotent civilizations treat less advanced peoples?  What does it mean to be human?<br /><br />The true gauge of this author's skill is that he treats the big questions without neglecting the need to tell a compelling story.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Another fascinating book...", "text": "Where Shall Wisdom be Found? is another fascinating book by Harold Bloom.  He (somewhat arbitrarily) chooses the greatest wisdom writers of all time, and his perspective on their work is very illuminating.  He goes through the history of the western world and selects two authors from each time period.  The couplets are Job and Ecclesiastes (books, not people), Plato and Homer, Cervantes and Shakespeare, Montaigne and Francis Bacon, Samuel Johnson and Goethe, Emerson and Nietzche, Freud and Proust, and Thomas and Saint Augustine.<br /><br />Even though I highly recommend this work, I disagree with much of what Mr. Bloom has to say.  What makes it worthwhile is his invaluable commentary of the figures listed above - who they were, and the thoughts they express.  However, nowhere in the book does Bloom give us HIS definition of what wisdom is - and everything is judged by his own very personal standards.<br /><br />Literary criticism is, by definition, subjective; and it is Mr. Bloom's own personal prejudices that may put some readers off.  In his defense, at least he is honest about his prejudices.  \"I agree with absolutely nothing in The City of God, but then the book is not addressed to a Jew and a Gnostic.\"  Mr. Bloom constantly reminds us that he is not a philosopher; so, in the battle between literature and philosophy, he continuously asserts that we prefer literature.  He considers Plato the greatest philosopher, but casually tosses him aside with preference to Homer, Cervantes, and Shakespeare.<br /><br />In trying to decipher his criteria for wisdom, it seems to center on useful aphorisms.  It seems to be the reason he prefers literature rather than carefully constructed philosophical arguments.  I had a logic teacher who uses to disparage maxims as \"bumper sticker philosophy,\" and I think he has a point.<br /><br />Also, in this stage in his career, Mr. Bloom has lost sight of who the true enemy is.  He continues a pointless and wrongheaded feud with Stephen King and J. K. Rowling as `enemies of literacy.'  Nothing could be further off base.  He writes that his criteria for reading are \"aesthetic splendor, intellectual power, wisdom.\"  These are not the only criteria - sometimes you just want a good story.  And, if I may be a philistine for a moment, I do think you can find a bit of wisdom even from Harry Potter, unless you are determined not to find it.<br /><br />At a reading, Mr. Bloom said he should have included Kierkegaard, who keeps popping up in this book.  I think Kierkegaard would have illuminated much about wisdom.  It is not so much about saying that Plato is wrong and Shakespeare is right, but about one's own commitment to a belief system.  Bloom rightly points out that literature holds a mirror, not to nature, but to ourselves.  We find the wisdom in books that we are looking for.  Mr. Bloom's wisdom may not be yours.", "images": [], "asin": "1573222844", "parent_asin": "1573222844", "user_id": "AFS5WG7LHUZJVOZHPMPESFULFK3Q", "timestamp": 1098795206000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "have your cake and eat it too", "text": "Reading this book is a bit like taking a really big bite of something really chewy. Taffy maybe, and not your favorite flavor, either, although definitely one you like. It's good, but you might feel like you have to work too hard.<br /><br />Shriver takes her cue from the multiple universe idea that there exists a separate reality that has sprung from each decision. There's a universe in which you did X, and a universe in which you didn't do X (or did Y). Fortunately, she doesn't try to examine this theory to its fullest, but takes a single decision made a single person, and expands her universes from there. What drives this book, then, is not \"did she or didn't she\" (she both did and didn't, in alternate chapters), but what is the result of both decisions.<br /><br />Shriver employs some very clever techniques to help her explore this theme. As the parallel chapters progress along the same time line, we see how similar the two universes are, but also how wildly different, as sometimes identical dialogue is spoken, but in vastly different contexts, or even by different characters. Shriver even gives her reader occasional anchors in time (helping to tie parallel chapters in time) by relating how the characters in each universe respond to international news events, such as the death of Princess Diana and the September 11th attacks.<br /><br />Shriver also does a great job of keeping her main character consistent through both story-lines. It's easy (easier, at least) to write a character who responds to a single set of events, than it is to write a character who must respond to two parallel sets of events and yet remain believable as a single character. Shriver absolutely gets this part right. But that is also part of what makes reading this book seem like hard work - every time you get somewhere in the narrative, you are instantly sent back to the beginning of the timeframe and must go through it all again, with the same mindset, if different details. Even the best of characters might get a little tiresome through all that. The real triumph is perhaps that we care about what happens in both realities, and can't easily say which choice was the right one.", "images": [], "asin": "0061187895", "parent_asin": "0061187895", "user_id": "AGIUG5WQNUYQCXSTO6NC5U7WTCBA", "timestamp": 1257689301000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "In many ways a classic picaresque novel", "text": "Amy Bloom's Away is in many ways a classic picaresque novel: an episodic story chronicling the life a low-caste rascal embarked on a quest and featuring a new and memorable secondary character at each major turning point. Lillian Leyb is not a rascal by nature, but circumstance forces her into a series of petty crimes. A peasant living in a shtetl in the 1924 Russia of Joseph Stalin, Lillian loses her entire family in a bloody pogrom, with her parents and husband killed, and her two-year-old daughter, Sophie, missing. After a cousin tells her of seeing Sophie's body floating past in the river, Lillian heads for America and winds up living with another cousin an apartment on the Lower East Side where the immigrant boarders sleep in day and night shifts. Though she can barely sew, intelligent and resourceful Lillian manages to land a job in the costume department of a Yiddish theater, leading us to the first of the memorable minor characters: a theatrical impresario, his matinee idol son, and his tailor-turned-playwright. Lillian's New York idyll when another cousin arrives from the old country with news that her daughter isn't dead but rather was rescued from the pogrom and adopted by a couple who headed east to Siberia rather than west to America. Determined to reclaim Sophie and in possession of trip plan complete with maps ripped out of from library books, Lillian chooses the shortest possible route -- west to Seattle, north to Alaska, and west again across the Bering Strait to Siberia. The New York episode and flasbacks to Russia take up the first 100 pages of this short novel and her quest the final 140 pages. On the trip we meet Gumdrop, a black Seattle prostitute, and Chinky Chan, an accomplished grifter from a family of swindlers. Unlike so many literary novels, Away offers both memorable characters and an engaging plot. Although the bulk of the novel is told from the viewpoint of Lillian and a handful of other characters, now and then an omniscient all-knowing narrator appears who offers a capsulized life story of the engaging characters Lillian leaves in her wake.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "One of the most important works ever written", "text": "In the history of written language, few books have proved to be as important (and as entertaining) as The Histories by Herodotus.  Not only is this the first historical text ever written, it's also a thrilling tale of adventure, intrigue, and heroism.  Beginning with the Trojan War (the most important event in history, according to the ancient Greeks), Herodotus tracks the development of the mighty Persian Empire and its eventual clash with the peoples of Greece in the 5th century B.C.  Along the way, the reader is given a guided tour of the people and places of the ancient world.  If your knowledge of this time period is based exclusively on The History Channel and \"300\", reading this book will give you a new appreciation for like in the distant past.<br /><br />Be warned though, Herodotus, at times, is more concerned with telling a good story than a true one.  It seems impossible to think that he had access to all the places and events he describes; in many cases, he obviously either invents stories or passes along accepted myths.  Furthermore, as the inventor of the history text, he really had no idea where to begin his story or what was relevant to his purpose (which was describing how and why the Greeks were able to defeat the invading Persians).  To solve this problem it seems, Herodotus included every source and every anecdote he had access to.  To help move the story along for the reader, I would recommend skipping over the section devoted to the geography of Egypt (or any of the other long passages related to mountains, rivers or deserts for that matter) - doing so will not interfer at all with the rest of the book.<br /><br />This is an endlessly diverting and dense work to read, especially if you don't know very much about ancient history, yet it's also very entertaining and very enlightening.  Herodotus' treatment of war, politics and human behavior are still as relevant today as it was 2500 years ago.  There is a reason why this book is still read to this day, and anyone who wants to consider themselves \"well-read\" needs to read this work.", "images": [], "asin": "0140449086", "parent_asin": "0140449086", "user_id": "AFKI6LRA4K7OQDO4VNWI6EORANMA", "timestamp": 1198409394000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Reads more like a horror story than romance. Fun times", "text": "Great. As if silk shirts weren't enough, the H has a suede suit. Ye gods, you Brits.<br /><br />Continuing with the sartorial portion of our review, gentle readers, I don't even want to know what a \"body shirt\" is 'cause the H is wearing one.<br /><br />UPDATE: I don't know which is more appalling: the disclosure on page 164 that gobsmaks the h and me or black suede pants and black leather jerkin the H wears on page 168.<br /><br />REVIEW<br /><br />Honestly don't know what to say, but my heart pounded on a couple of occasions. Serious case of \"Molly, you in danger girl!\" If Anne Mather had sold this as a horror story, it would be a 4 star, hands down. This h is snakebit.<br /><br />This plot was filled with one of the biggest collection of nasty, need to die characters as I have ever come across: the lying father of the H, the lying and distant mother of the h, the lying, criminal as well as abusive husband of the h. Surprisingly, the H is not included in the abusive category. Given the wardrobe choices listed above he's a Courvoisier, a dose of Brut, and two sideburns away from belting out \"After the Loving\", but a bad guy he's not.<br /><br />Bottom line, our h and H grew up together, kind of. He was older, but never had a real GF until the h turned 18. He was waiting for her to grow up. Sweet right. Yeah, unfortunately as with most humans, these two had parents. They would have been better off raised by wolves frankly. The h's father commits suicide, and suddenly the H is nowhere to be found. After a year or so, the h flops into a relationship with a dweeb then marriage. Another unfortunate incident, the fiancee with mommy issues that the h is thinking of kicking to the curb has an accident four days before the wedding and is paralyzed so she HAS to marry him.<br /><br />A few years later, the H arrives and wants her to see his father who was always like an uncle to her. Hubby's not happy. Before she leaves for the islands, she finds out he was having an affair as late as the week of their wedding, and she's the one who gets slapped. The H brings along his piece of the week who happily tells the h she's pregnant. She's not.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />At the island, the H's father tells her that HE told HER father that she was his daughter. I'll wait while you ponder that one out.....Hmm, I wonder if that confession had anything to do with the h's father blowing his brains out. The h's mom was there and denied it all to the h's father, but apparently he didn't believe it as the other two had had a sexual relationship before. The h then figures out that the H, the love of her life, must think they were half-siblings, and that was why he broke it off. It doesn't explain the still handsy way he is with her. Nothing too much, but still a big ick if he thinks she's such forbidden fruit. She leaves soon for England.<br /><br />Back home in rainy England she finds out more. The H's dad dies and wants to leave her half his fortune. Guilt money. A visit to the attorney to deny it (she has somewhat of martyr complex) she finds out that her husband had a child with the woman he was with which explains why he never received any insurance money from the accident. She also finds out that her mother was the one who lied to the H and said they were half-siblings out of spite and social snobbery. I love it when these British novels play the social class card.<br /><br />It all winds up nicely as, unfortunately, the mother is forgiven and the horrible husband is paid off. Suffer, suffer, suffer.<br /><br />The romance was secondary to the whole machinations of all the other evil ones here. Anne must have been in a cranky mood the week she wrote this. A few tweaks and Frankenstein would have a run for its money.", "images": [], "asin": "B000PCB390", "parent_asin": "B000PCB390", "user_id": "AGV2YOLD4L2ZE4XWOUOJYSZ7ILLQ", "timestamp": 1541778239573, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

As the bunny slowly subsides into bed and sleep, the light in the room dims until shapes are nearly imperceptible.  This warm and comforting story traces the emotional transition of a young child from active relationship to restful solitude, all in the context of a stable and secure home emblemized by the unchanging objects in the room.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "This is pretty bad. I am baffled by all these five-star reviews.", "text": "This novelization starts out pretty strong. We see the old King Hamlet, brooding, drinking, lamenting the politics and decadence of his court, compared to the Viking virtues of war and conquest... this is good stuff, a well-written unpacking of many things Shakespeare's play merely touched upon. Kind of like high-class &#34;fan fiction&#34;, bringing a certain historicity and context to a well-known, and much-beloved story.<br /><br />Then it quickly goes off the rails. The author's most egregious fault lies in altering the perfectly-balanced characters (or maybe perfectly-unbalanced) borne of Shakespeare's genius. Their motivations, actions, background, and histories are changed. With the possible exception of the old King Hamlet, every character in the novel (especially the Prince)  is made dumber, blander, mushier, and worse than their counterparts in the play. The balance of the plot and players is thrown out the window, and every character is reduced to essentially the same personality: selfish, conniving, full of ennui. They are all the same, just placed in different roles and circumstances. It's like reading genre-fiction for adolescents. Where Shakespeare's Elsinore was a dazzling and bewildering tapestry of madness, lies, and moral complexity, this version of Elsinore is just a sticky, icky, soap-opera.<br /><br />The author makes the bumbling and embarrassing mistake of trying (repeatedly) to build tension and suspense surrounding perhaps the best-known and most widely-studied plot developments in the history of ever. It's kind of like reading a rendition of Humpty-Dumpty trying to build complacency and then fear in the reader about whether Humpty will be able to maintain his perch on the wall.<br /><br />The clumsy and awkward attempts to &#34;freshen up&#34; perhaps the greatest dramatic plot in all of literature, the dull and shallow homogenization of Shakespeare's bottomless and brilliant characters... these faults are unforgivably compounded by the smarmy and cringe-inducing eye-winks and in-jokes from the author, mostly delivered by the newly-invented character of (wait for it)...Yorick, Jr. (I swear I am not making this up). That's right. You know that skull to whom Shakespeare's Hamlet famously addresses his soliloquy on death and mortality? Well, in this novelization, said skull is given not only a lurid and melodramatic back-story, but also a living son, who follows Hamlet around making wisecracks and dirty jokes, and quoting famous lines from the play, complete with &#34;Hmm, where have I heard that before?&#34; type responses from the Prince, just in case you weren't perceptive enough to catch the joke without a laugh-track. If you ever thought Shakespeare's Hamlet was really missing a foul-mouthed, comical sort of Yoda/Mr Miyagi character to explain everything, this might be just the &#34;Hamlet&#34; you're looking for.", "images": [], "asin": "B00IRH401S", "parent_asin": "B00IRH401S", "user_id": "AHHL4VCKCJ56DBZWM2IFGM2QFUHA", "timestamp": 1401490641000, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Gun-toting thugs, dark secrets, and even a hurricane... what else do you want?", "text": "This is a \"status plus\" entry in Mr. Parker's long-running series.  The \"status\" part is the usual reliable detective plot involving a violent crime or two, an inquisitive Spenser, lots of character banter, and the resolution of the crime or crimes involving a dark family secret or deep character flaw on someone's part (and often both).  That's all here, and if it's all a bit familiar, it's still as compelling as always in the author's capable hands.<br /><br />The \"plus\" part comes into play in the opening chapters, where we see something new: a huge multi-chapter murder/kidnapping scene set amid a huge hurricane.  Spenser is doing some security work at a wedding being held on some rich folks' private island when the hurricane hits, and it's quite something to see Spenser playing cat-and-mouse with the uzi-carrying kidnappers while the hurricane rages and Susan is in danger, too.  It's a pretty memorable fifty or sixty page opening, and a set piece not seen since the Star Wars-like storming-of-the-bad-guys'-fortress sequence from \"A Catskill Eagle\" many years ago.<br /><br />And later on, there's also a little controversy to thicken the broth, as Spenser makes some interesting decisions at the conclusion of the kidnapping investigation that even give Hawk pause for a moment.  Without revealing too much, I'll just say this: Spenser's always been more concerned with who orders the violence than with who actually pulls the trigger (the hired gun known simply as \"Ty Bop\" has been getting away with murder for years for this reason), so my jaw didn't drop too much over the resolution.  It is dark, though.<br /><br />On a somewhat lighter note, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't any further potential wedding talk between Spenser and Susan this time out.  And this after they practically set a date in the previous entry, \"Now and Then\".  Mr. Parker does like to keep us fans in suspense.<br /><br />In the end, \"Rough Weather\" continues the fairly high quality and fairly sharp stories of the last couple of \"Spenser\" novels.  That is, the formula is pretty apparent but 1) it's still a pretty good formula and 2) the actual stories lately have been pretty memorable.  Heck, even the scary, villainous \"Grey Man\" gets the patented Parker \"dark family secret\" treatment this time out.  My Kindle pages were definitely turning (or whatever it is that Kindle pages do).<br /><br />Yes, to an extent, I can see why some reviewers grumble, but for me, Robert Parker and Spenser are still worth the time of any serious mystery/suspense enthusiast.", "images": [], "asin": "0399155198", "parent_asin": "0399155198", "user_id": "AGRN7P3NXUINRLMALUHN2C3NSAVA", "timestamp": 1228254181000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful story...", "text": "I received a free advance readers' copy and am providing this review voluntarily...<br /><br />In The Girl From Berlin, Liesel Scholz is an extremely privileged girl living with her family in a beautiful home paid<br />for by the Hitler run government in 1936. She notices some changes around her concerning the Jews but isn't too concerned until one day she sees a horrific incident which makes her truly realize what's going on. This coupled with a chance encounter with Rosa, her Jewish housekeeper's daughter convinces Liesel that she must help the Jews. The reader is then taken to 1946 after the US has beaten the Germans in World War II and an American scientist, Sam Houghton, is assigned to help get information from Nazis and help rebuild Germany. He hires a woman named Anna as his secretary but she is hiding some dark secrets about her links to the Nazi party herself.<br /><br />As with stories about World War II, this story was full of indignities to Jews. It showed that some Germans, even though not believers of Hitler's rhetoric, were forced to comply and assist with his plans or risk death for them and their families. I truly admired Liesel and her mother, Ilse, for their stance but it was truly Liesel's brother and Ilse's son, Friedy, who I grew to love and who became my favorite character.<br /><br />This was a story that sadly showed how power can corrupt people who we think are incorruptible. And, it also showed how one person can make a difference if he/she really wants to. It was a beautiful, tragic story and I would love to try more of this author's work because of it.<br /><br />Due to very disturbing scenes, this books should be read by adults and older teens.", "images": [], "asin": "B08QPZG2G3", "parent_asin": "B08QPZG2G3", "user_id": "AF5LW65VBEM3OKA2JMFXXDYNQMMQ", "timestamp": 1614357354737, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Johnson is an historian who intends to teach a lesson with this writings, to show us what we should draw from the subject's life, works, and thoughts to better our own lives.<br /><br />Thus it is with Johnson's biography of Socrates, the first and perhaps still the greatest of the moral philosophers. Rather than a dry recitation of what we know of Socrates's life and works, Johnson looks at themes in Socrates' life --bravery; his love for Athens; an absolute commitment to doing what was right and just; and irony-- and uses them to illustrate those things that should be valuable in our own lives, and thus improve our lives for being valued. Johnson reads much into the texts and context, sometimes making assumptions and presenting them as facts because he's sure they must be true, and there is the occasional odd error, but the broad lessons Johnson teaches (or, rather, relates what Socrates taught) and the beauty in his writing make them forgivable.

The main focus in on neuromarketing, which is how marketing, products, logos, scents etc, affect our brains unconsciously. Conducting a big study of 2,081 participants in 5 countries, Lindstrom got to see brain scans of folks as they viewed and thought about different brands, products and companies. A major takeaway is that frequently, what people say is not what they do. Lindstrom also covers the \"mirror neuron\" that helps explain why we want to emulate others. He also makes the argument that brands can be like a religion (the twisting of Oreos as ritual, for example).<br /><br />Interesting Things I Learned:<br /><br />  * NASCAR fans are very brand loyal<br /><br />  * Sex doesn't always sell<br /><br />  * About 90% of buying behavior is unconscious<br /><br />  * Aromas and sounds are very effective at persuading customers unconsciously<br /><br />  * Product placement only works if it makes sense in the program, i.e. Reese's Pieces luring E.T. out of the woods, or only AT&T users being able to text American Idol votes.<br /><br />  * Coke is featured on American Idol 60% of the time<br /><br />  * Warnings on cigarette packs have no effect<br /><br />  * 8 out of 10 new products fail within 3 months<br /><br />Pros: Interesting, quick read<br /><br />Cons: He seems to have a big ego in that there's plenty of \"look what I did, designed, was involved with\" stuff in the book.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Like its title, brilliant flashes over soggy stretches", "text": "The title comes from the \"green flash\" which Stone, stoned, glimpsed from a Mexican beach. Much of the insight here resembles the recollectons one might expect from a friend of Ken Kesey, an acquaintance of Tim Leary, and one who hung out with the scions of the counterculture in New York City, New Orleans, California north and south, London, Mexico, and Vietnam. That is, pages at a time become illuminated with wisdom-- before sinking again into a miasma of mundane names, places, and events filtered muddily or waveringly through uninspired, if competent, prose. I have only read two novels by Stone, \"A Flag for Sunrise,\" and the disappointing \"Damascus Gate.\" Like the latter book, \"Prime Green\" stumbles when it could have soared on a promising premise.<br /><br />The opening chapter rambles on about his stint in the Navy; polar-driven wind and the feel of being at the bridge gain evocative detail, but then the narrative wanders off into recollections of an Australian swimmer he fancied, a bit of action he glimpsed during the Suez crisis, and exchanging Playboys with a Soviet crew. All three anecdotes fizzle. They almost follow randomly, such is the nature of this compilation of memories. Perhaps this casual style conceals careful craft. But, from a writer of Stone's level, that is, of critical acclaim more than another hack bestselling scribe, the offhanded attitude towards such potentially valuable incidents became disappoining. They are treated so offhandedly you wonder why he troubled to bring them up. Much of this book follows suit. It reminds me of a few all-nighters, if you could tape them, with a great storyteller; the difference is, you tend to edit mentally what you were bored or confused by, and highlight the stories which enraptured you, to replay again in your memory. I'd return to this book in the same manner.<br /><br />For instance, the Bowery and its sudden replacement of white old bums with tough young blacks released from prison circa 1960 sets up a treatise on this sociological phenomenon. But, suddenly, Stone in the next paragraph sidles off into how he wrote copy for a furniture firm. Admittedly, he excels at his harrowing yet hilarious description of writing for the right-wing populist NY Daily News, which like certain media today manages to arouse the contempt of the working class for the system that supposedly favors those less qualified, yet deflects any blame from capitalism or the rich themselves for this inequality and this cynical game of having the victims turn on one another.<br /><br />His send-up of another bottom-feeding journalistic stint at what he calls the National Thunder, a sort of Weekly World News, is priceless. Anyone who could survive a paper that created headlines like \"Armless Veteran Beaten for Not Saluting Flag\" or a close runner-up, \"Skydiver Devoured By Starving Birds,\" merits some acclaim for such anecdotes. His accounts of being under the knife for a burst vessel in his brain, of interviewing bitter draftees in Vietnam, of watching the moon on the night of the first landing in 1969 from the California hills, all ring true; his narrative leaps to fitful if brief elegance in these sections. On drugs, Stone glimpses time's wheel and struggles to convey his psychedelic revelation. I wonder if any bard from this time can do so?<br /><br />The remainder of the book, once Stone leaves in search of the elusive authenticity that takes him, seemingly with little money and the kindness of many strangers become friends, to Stanford on a fellowship, to London, to Vietnam, and to Mexico in a tumultuous but-- for a while-- rather childlike time despite his wife and two children (who are barely mentioned) to support does create in this reader a sense of how much could be seen and heard and experienced by carefree Americans with not much cash, plenty of drugs, and a sense of adventure that in our day has narrowed and priced out all but the affluent or the heavily guarded! Comparing his coming of age with the later century, the combination of a strong dollar, cheap costs of living, and goodwill manage, nearly, to create a glimpse of utopia. On the other hand, his escape from menacing sailors on a Greyhound bus ride from hell that winds up with him barely getting away from the ironically if improbably named hamlet of Highspire, Pennsylvania marks a gothic tale where Poe meets Genet.<br /><br />If you want a sense of the Sixties, disjointed and disconnected, with wisdom scattered along with a lot of langour, this does re-create a tone appropriate to these times. No history, or even tightly written account, nonetheless for all its faults, I learned from it. The conclusions are the expected sadness at the decade's waste of its promise, and the government infiltration and corporate co-opting of its ideals and its innocence. Not as many knockout punches as I expected, for the book needed editing and substantial tightening. It keeps reeling about, when it should have cut the flab and trimmed up under a drill sargeant of an editor, such as he used to work for in Manhattan in the early 60s.<br /><br />The book bumps into the famous, nods, chats, and shuffles off again, In its slackness, casual air of street cred meets the dinner party, and Hollywood mingling with the Bowery, perhaps Stone, who managed to be in all of the proper places, dreadful or erotic, exotic or hilarious, remains the jester-cynic who sneers at the powers that be but knows if he had his chance on the throne (he gets a quick perch during his Hollywood visit), he'd settle down there comfortably enough. Stone, in a sloppy but occasionally memorable account, emerges rather blowsily, yet endearingly avuncular. He's slightly askew, a fitting if exasperatingly rambling witness and slyly calculating chronicler for a messy decade.", "images": [], "asin": "0060198168", "parent_asin": "0060198168", "user_id": "AHBHBD27MLASKYJLAHAN2BRSYDKA", "timestamp": 1191356823000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Enders justify the means", "text": "Ender Wiggin is a very unusual boy -- he's a brilliant tactician, a genius, and a despised \"third\" in a future that only allows two children. He's also six years old.<br /><br />And despite the fact that Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic is about a little boy learning how to be a warrior, \"Ender's Game\" is a pretty gripping and sometimes grim adventure story. The descriptions of children being taught out how to be cold-blooded warriors is pretty creepy, but the well-developed future world that Card comes up with is pretty awesome.<br /><br />After a fight with a gang of bullies, Ender Wiggin is approached by an army officer who wants him to join the elite Battleschool, where kid geniuses become soldiers -- basically because aliens are about to attack Earth AGAIN and may end up wiping out the human race. His brother Peter is too wild and cruel, and his beloved sister Valentine is too mild-mannered.<br /><br />Ender accepts, and quickly finds himself in a dog-eat-dog space school where he soon becomes loathed for the special treatment the teachers occasionally give him -- when they aren't observing his every move. And it soon becomes obvious that Ender has a natural ability that exceeds that of most of the Battleschool recruits: he instinctively knows how to outmaneuver his opponents and protect himself in a fight, even if he annoys some of the \"army\" commanders who don't like being outshone.<br /><br />Back on Earth, his brother and sister try to alter the increasingly unstable politics of Earth by subtle manipulation of the public, a situation that may bring the ruthless Peter into greater power. And as Ender reaches the end of his training, he faces both the buggers and the knowledge of what he is capable of.<br /><br />\"Ender's Game\" is kind of an unusual space opera, because the actual war between humans and buggers is not front-and-center until the last act of the story. Up until then, it's about following Ender and his equally unusual siblings as they develop prematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason). Ender's time at Battle School and Command School feel rather slow at times, only for things to blossom in the final laps of the novel -- Card suddenly turns all our feelings and expectations on their heads. The tragedy of children turned into soldiers becomes even more tragic as we discover what the war is actually all about.<br /><br />As you'd expect from Fascist Hogwarts In Space, there are a lot of kids at Battle School who are developed to certain degrees. But the center of the story is Ender himself -- and despite being a tactical genius with loads of natural ability, Ender never seems like a Wesley Crusher. Like a boy destined to be a Spartan warrior, his inborn skills are what will keep him from ever finding peace. His childhood is sacrificed for war.<br /><br />The other part of the story rests on Peter and Valentine -- Valentine is too nice, while Peter is gradually revealed to be a ruthless genius who works anything and anyone for his goals, which may or may not be self-serving. It's oddly fun to see the growing influence of \"Demosthenes\" and \"Locke\" on the cruel government.<br /><br />\"Ender's Game\" is an intelligent, gripping space opera with an undercurrent of intense tragedy -- it's kind of slow at times, but the strong writing and intriguing main trio keep it afloat.", "images": [], "asin": "B001NOD0Q8", "parent_asin": "B001NOD0Q8", "user_id": "AHVIMKECEZDXXK5QIGX7KWJPN6DQ", "timestamp": 1368235385000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

(1) Goldfish represent wealth and fertility and should never be placed in the kitchen or bedroom.  (2) Get rid of the clutter because &quot;hoarding creates stale energy.&quot;  (3) Sharp corners and angles in your furniture create a disruptive flow, while rounded objects create harmony.  (4) Cool colors create passive energy while warm tones are energetic and passionate.

A few chapters get into really technical details and dollar amounts that would make an accountant's heart beat faster but nearer the end of the book your eyes may start to glaze over. lol<br /><br />The sections on warehouses made me respect the hard work of the employees and feel grateful to them. However automated warehouses sound like a good idea in the long run.<br /><br />My criticism of this book is that the author didn't seem to make the effort to interview many happy amazon employees besides to mention that smart people enjoy working with other brilliant employees.<br />Which must be bliss as they are part of making the future come true.<br /><br />I also did not agree with the author about how he views amazon if it was a person. Amazon to me is more like a trusted friend who helps me find all the things I learn to love and need. The other day I desperately needed supplies for my sick cat and amazon sent them to me ahead of the regular schedule. That to me was the kindest thing they have done for me and I really appreciated it.<br /><br />So read this book with a pinch of salt because the author's ideas are not altogether mainstream. He is a good researcher and has an amazing handle on all the information but I think even he does not see the big picture the way I have come to view it over the years. You can't stop the future from happening the way it is supposed to. That is all I can say!!!!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "images": [], "asin": "1736001205", "parent_asin": "1736001205", "user_id": "AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA", "timestamp": 1668291501614, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The author's heart is in the right place", "text": "The notion of a &quot;spine-tingler&quot; based upon the politicalminutiae surrounding a Presidential election is unusual, to be sure,and presents many possibilities in terms of character, plot, andideological theme.  Richard Warren Field has taken the field ofcontemporary American electoral politics and woven an interesting,though not terribly well-written tale of a third party candidacy thatthrows the historically curious American Electoral College-basedelectoral system into a veritable tizzy.  In presenting thehypothetical eco-leftist candidacy of one Michael Edwards, Field usesthe novel as a pulpit for the presentation of some interestingprogressive ideas, while simultaneously bringing to light some of the(many) flaws within the current electoral system.  If he actually werea novelist instead of an earnest reformer trying to &quot;spread theword&quot; using a literary form that clearly is difficult for him,the book would be more of a success.<br />In developing a&quot;page-turner&quot; about a hypothetical election, Field does hisbest to embellish his plot with suspense, skullduggery, and even onoccasion, sex.  Once the halfway point in the novel is reached, thingsbegin to move along quickly and entertainingly, and indeed, the bookin its final stages is hard to put down.  I also compliment Field forusing the novel as a kind of educational device regarding theElectoral College system and some other strange and often-arcaneaspects of the American approach to Presidential elections.  Finally,some of the ideas his upstart candidate preaches in his campaign arenoble and interesting, particularly those regarding the desirabilityof moving our society in a more ecologically responsible direction.In light of the current threats posed by global warming and (again)soaring energy prices, the need for a renewed commitment to renewableenergy and a less materially gluttonous lifestyle has never been moreapparent.<br />As a novel, however, *The Election* is not entirelysuccessful.  First of all, the characters are oppressively shallow andwooden, and the narration lacks any real litarary nuance ordescriptive depth. The strength of the book is in its messages, notits style of presentation.  Second, in order to make his &quot;thirdparty that catches fire&quot; theme at all plausible, Field needed tocreate a scenario in which the ecofriendly message of Michael Edwardswould suddenly seem significant enough to cause people to abandon the&quot;lesser of two evils&quot; mindset that has kept the vastmajority of voters attached to the two-party system for decades.Americans certainly are supportive overall of environmentalprotection, but from all indications, ecological issues simply are notamong the most significant issues that influence people's votes.  Thatthey could become so is certainly possible, but it would require somekind of threat or crisis (and likely one that includes a body count),and Field does not present any such scenario that would move &quot;theenvironment&quot; to the top of people's electoralagenda....<br />Overall, I salute Mr. Field for his dedication topossible significant change through the electoral system, and Irecommend the book to anyone who has ever fantasized about an electionshocker that would bring an eco-friendly administration into power.The cynic in me finds his scenario insufficiently plausible, butcertainly Field's heart is in the right place.

If you read Judges, chapter 4, you'll get a more solid view of what the Bibles say about Deborah.<br /><br />Teresa Pollard explains the theology behind her writings in an Author's Note at the front of the novel.<br /><br />In this book, Lappidoth (Deborah's husband) is more of a title than  a name. Lappidoth means torch or oil lamps, so the writer has placed Barak as her husband, and the two of them make and sell wicks for lamps that are brighter than usual. The priests buy their wicks exclusively because they're so bright.<br /><br />He is known by Lappidoth when he is selling wicks to priests and others, and as Barak as he begins to be the leader of the Israelite army against the overwhelming forces of Jabin, king of Canaan.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "For avant-gardist gardening snobs", "text": "Thomas Hobbs is, at least in the persona he presents in this book, an avant-gardist gardening snob.  He sees gardening as a fashion-driven art, where trendy plants are to be discarded as soon as they become too popular with the petit bourgeoisie, for whom his contempt is made clear on almost every page of text. Some of this stuff can't be spoofed, because it's impossible to be more catty than Hobbs here (block quotes preceded by ** and italics presented as ALL CAPS):<br /><br />** Some gardeners will never learn the art of plant assemblage... As I drive by their predictable efforts, I often wonder, \"Is Life Easier?\"<br /><br />** Being a left-handed, Gemini breach-birth ALLOWS me to love tetraploid daylilies. It is WHO I AM BOTANICALLY.<br /><br />** Bowling balls are appropriate in Marcia Donahue's garden/gallery in Berkeley, California, because SHE DID IT FIRST.<br /><br />Hobbs is obsessed with rejection of the common and the cliched, but most of his featured gardens also look alike, in part because they're almost all small shaded urban gardens in the coastal Northwest, but more notably because they eschew flowers in favor of foliage plants - mostly bright or spiky - with color from kitschy cast-offs and outr\u00e9 sculpture, including flesh-colored ceramic penises.<br /><br />In my (hardly original) opinion, a big problem with most people's enjoyment of the arts today is that the field has already done what is pretty or handsome, and since its current practitioners are jaded by their predecessors' work and aspire to being original, they must often produce what most nonspecialists consider ugly. This is notably a problem with architecture and oil painting (and classical music) by about World War I, and haute couture since the Kennedy Administration. So far horticulture has largely escaped the curse of avant-gardist ugliness, but not in this book. I wondered whether it was fair to Hobbs to say he has passed a step beyond \"Shocking Beauty\" to where much of this book is ugly, but then I came to his penultimate page of prose:<br /><br />** I have noticed a switch in gardening, from \"pretty\" to what I call \"the New Ugly.\" I find this fascinating and very, very attractive. In gardening, UGLY HAS BEEN REDEFINED by brilliant plantsmen and -women who get absolutely no thrill from trying to make a pretty picture. By increasing the dosage of all that is weird and unexpected, these thrillseekers are creating powerful, unforgettable experiences.<br /><br />Umh, NO IT HASN'T! If we wanted \"powerful, unforgettable experiences\" of ugliness, we would just move into a junkyard next to an oil refinery! That said, if the book's title or dust-jacket reflected this decadent philosophy, I could rate it 4 stars [...]<br /><br />Perhaps oddly, Hobbs' Vancouver garden is larger, far more colorful and floriferous, and far more beautiful, than the preceding gardens. Hobbs doesn't fail to add a campy dramatic element, however, to his discovery of the Vancouver house:<br /><br />** I will never forget ringing the doorbell, expecting \"Max,\" [from Sunset Boulevard] or at least Harvey Korman dressed as \"Max,\" to open the door. Instead, a very short Alfred Hitchcock type greeted us, with a badly-wigged woman peering over his shoulder.<br /><br />As you might have guessed, the text of this book is more about Hobbs' persona than about gardening. But it isn't until the very last page of prose that we learn exactly how, for Hobbs, the garden is therapy - about talking to plants, which most people can't do (\"and it shows\"!) - and about remembering gardeners who gave him plants and then died of AIDS. Life is a veil of tears, so maybe we should cut him some slack, even if we are not in love with ugliness.", "images": [], "asin": "0881926469", "parent_asin": "0881926469", "user_id": "AHFSWVRFTJGNDGJ6CAHPRL3XUW4Q", "timestamp": 1137287852000, "helpful_vote": 52, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Another Puzzle Piece of the Steve Job Portrait.", "text": "You are reading this not because you really care about Apple but because Steve Jobs is such an enigma. His companies are stronger than ever. What should Apple do? &#34;What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.&#34; Now Michael Dell is fighting to keep his own fledgling alive and Steve's baby is the one running the world.<br /><br />We have watched from the sidelines as book after book has come out and everyone is painting a small section of a larger portrait.<br />If you've read any of the previous biographies, and I'm sure you have, you know there is so much to write and one person is so much more complex than any writer could ever portray them as. It really is amazing how everyone is so different.<br /><br />This book appears to show Steve as a human and a person who realizes he has faults. &#34;How can this be me?&#34; we've all asked ourselves, including Steve Jobs. What sets him apart from others is the ability to learn from mistakes. Other biographies, such as Walter Isaacson's, doesn't really portray him as a changing individual but more as a person who finally got the upperhand over his 'enemies'. I really don't think that's the main component of Jobs.<br /><br />His getting the upperhand wasn't to put others in their place, as Isaacson writes, but to deliver perfection. People standing in the way of the product, seen or unseen, would have to be removed. Crass? Sure, but not for the sake of being an ass but for the product and thinking different. Now in Steve's Job's world perfection is never perfect. It can always be improved and should be improved. Apple 3.5 has yet to prove it can deliver without the prior successes of the Steve Job's era. We'll find out.<br /><br />It's good to see Becoming Steve Job's showing another side to Steve. Steve really was a team player because all players have weaknesses. When you see he can hire someone on the spot because he saw the Dock, it shows it's about the product not that he had the ideas.<br /><br />Not all businesses will work or should run like Apple or Pixar. Some are more like Pirates and upstarts, setting out to change the world for future generations and others are more traditional. If you are the person who is set to change the world, go for it with everything you have. And while you're at it, continue to examine yourself.<br /><br />I do like this book but you really need to read this along with Isaccson's book. Both have a much clearer picture when read together.<br />What I would really love to see is a book on how OSX (NeXT) was such a modular beast, changing architectures quickly from Motorola to Intel and ARM chips with relatively little hiccups. Most people wouldn't have been able to tell if it wasn't for being told by Apple. Even Bill Gates didn't think it was possible yet Jobs and crew pulled it off.<br /><br />It would have been nice to see more about web objects since NeXT is what our current &#34;web&#34; internet is based on and was the first to have it. This is the reason Steve Jobs was able to sell NeXT to Apple because WebObjects were already be profitable and licensed to other companies. They would have made their money back even if they chose not to use the Unix OS.<br /><br />Think Different!", "images": [], "asin": "0385347405", "parent_asin": "0385347405", "user_id": "AFJUQN27A2WYVCLAMMVRVJS7METQ", "timestamp": 1427209198000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true}

I will confess what prompted me to get it is the waffles on the cover (which have a purpose, our main character's favorite word is waffle). This book was refreshing because in a world where everyone seems to be out for themselves lately, Somebody/Nobody emails Jessie out of the blue to help her navigate her way through her massive life change of moving from Chicago to Los Angeles because her father married someone he met on the internet without really telling Jessie anything about it.<br /><br />I completely empathize with having your world turned upside down since I changed high schools (and states) my senior year of high school. It was horribly awkward the first day of class and there are those nasty girls everywhere you go who seem to dislike you just because you're you. I thought the author captured this experience perfectly. I kind of wish I had a SN to get me through those first few months.<br /><br />I think all the characters in this book are well written and the plot is well developed (although honestly I think it took a tad too long to get to the end for the big reveal). I thoroughly enjoyed the author's writing style and I loved the random &quot;tell me three things&quot; segments of SN and Jessie's conversation. I looked forward to every exchange between Jessie and SN. Those were my favorite parts.<br /><br />My one teeny negative comment about this book is that the inside cover states it is for ages 12 and up. While I realize sex, underage drinking and profanity are sadly becoming norms in our society, I do not think this book is suited for 12 year olds. There is a lot of emotional upheaval as well as what is mentioned above and I think it would be too complex for someone who has not experienced the trials and tribulations of high school yet.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "New age-y...", "text": "I love Unschooling and after having doubted it, I saw firsthand unschooled kids absolutely thrive, making me rethink my views on it.  I still struggle with it, but it's truly a goal for me now.<br /><br />I also agree with many of the author's points.<br /><br />Having said that, this book is really more of a \"parenting in the present\" book and less to do with Unschooling.<br /><br />It took a weird turn a few times too.  She kept referring to sending your intention to the universe and the universe will reward you by making it happen.  And that she insists her kids believe that the universe will always give then what they want if they believe enough.  That they can be anything they want, do anything they want.  If they want to go on a cruise, the universe will make it happen.  If they want a kayak, the universe will provide one.  Those are actual examples from her family.  And when her kids wanted to explore another country, they set their intentions and the universe miraculously provided for them all to go (4 kids, 2 adults) .  It wreaks of privilege and just plain weirdness.  I was expecting her to start talking about crystals next.<br /><br />The book is also repetitive.  I'm only halfway through and I've already had to double check and make sure I hadn't already listened to quite a few sections.<br /><br />She brags about her kids and her stellar parenting constantly throughout the book.<br /><br />Speaking of listening, the narration is too robotic.  It's like a robot that tries to sound human.  It's irritating to listen to.<br /><br />There are better books about Unschooling out there.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "An Interesting Start", "text": "I don\u2019t often read crime thrillers, but I\u2019m aware of many of the tropes. And Cain pulls a lot of the standard ones out of the box for this story. However, while I found the serial killer plot line rather weak, I also got the feeling that Cain was simply using it to gradually build up the story of Gretchen and Archie, which is by far the most interesting aspect of the book. Gretchen is a sufficiently creepy and perceptive psychopath, made even creepier by the fact that she is a very pretty woman who seems more suited to beauty pageants than ruthlessly torturing and murdering people.<br /><br />Basically, Cain takes a different approach to a well-worn story: instead of a crack detective furiously hunting down his arch-serial-killer-nemesis, you have the repercussions of the end of that hunt \u2014 a broken detective, a world still filled with other evils, and a crazy killer who seems to have the ability to keep pulling stings even after she\u2019s been caught. She frames the classic cop-killer relationship from an interesting and fresh (and creepy) perspective.<br /><br />Despite the overall weakness of the crazy teacher plot, I get where Cain is coming from, and I appreciate her attempt to try something different. I think she just needs to work on the depth of the \u201ckiller of the week\u201d plots while building up the beautifully frightening interactions between Gretchen and Archie. In other words, she needs to concentrate on making sure all her plots and sub-plots are the same quality. With Heartsick, I found myself quickly skimming through some of the crazy teacher guy chapters so I could back to the Archie-Gretchen parts \u2014 one plot was noticeably stronger than the other. Balance, Cain. Balance.<br /><br />Other than that, I found the story pretty enjoyable. The characters are well-characterized. Her settings are adequately described.

While I liked Pledged a bit more this one (just felt it was put together a little better), I thought Geeks was still a valuable read both for anyone currently in the education system or anyone who doesn't remember their high school experiences fondly.<br /><br />Plenty of people have already discussed a summary of the book, so I won't repeat that here. Robbins does a great job of bringing the characters to life - I felt like I really knew them and the different struggles they were facing. I must admit that I enjoyed reading the characters' personal accounts better than the research and analysis portions of the book.  For me, the best parts of the book were after Robbins assigned each character a different challenge. I really enjoyed seeing how they reacted to their challenge, the things each one did to meet the challenge, and the results or changes in their life that sometimes followed.  It really made me wonder what would have happened in my high school days if, instead of accepting things the way they were and telling myself nothing could change, I had tried to make it change by doing things similar to what the characters in this book did (sorry for the vagueness - I'm trying to not give anything away so I don't ruin the experience for someone who hasn't read the book yet). This is also the part that I feel may be most valuable to a students who is struggling - having them read these examples of other students who struggled and the changes that some were able to make through their own actions.<br /><br />If I had one criticism of the book, it's that it doesn't touch on any research or ideas about kids who were popular in high school and who are now wildly successful.  The book can manage to give the impression that it's only the outliers who end up as successes, but this hasn't been always been true in real life (and I'm not just talking about people who, like the popular girl in this book, were part of the \"in-crowd\" but also could fit in with outliers).

It's obvious Boone and Riley are a perfect match, but they don't know it yet. I liked Riley's college roommates and the uncommon bond between the four women. The connection and lifelong friendship among the SEALs seemed a bit unrealistic (they're the best of friends as children, all make it through BUD/s, and served in the same SEAL Team) but their bond is tight (very believable) and their determination to build a sustainable community was understandable. Though I have no interest in such things myself and I'm not an Austen Fan Girl (at least not to the extremes that Riley and her gal pals go to), the premise made the characters who they are. The story kept moving and I was sad to see it end.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Abuse Of Basic Freedom", "text": "It can be argued that Freedom Of Speech is the Keystone of civilized citizenship, remove the one stone and all it supports is reduced to rubble. The right to speak freely carries with it great responsibility, it demands personal discipline that dictates when the moment calls for silence while another espouses that which others died to stop, and that is what this book is about. It relates the few who lacking a part of their Humanity use their right to speak to inflict pain and suffering, and to deny what is factually unassailable. It takes apart these parasites of cruelty who are largely without credentials in the fields they claim to be expert in, whose claim to scholarly pursuit is as fraudulent as the effluent that flows from their mouths, their books, and their advertisements.<br />This is also about men and women who produce The Historical Record with Scientific Exactitude, and who willingly modify that record when later evidence requires change. Mr. Michael Shermer and Mr. Alex Grobman are both Scholars and Historians who took years to document that which is accepted as truth by all but the mentally bent. Immanuel Khant knew how these deniers were made, these deniers of history when he said, \"Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made nothing entirely straight can be built\".<br />Deny the Holocaust. Deny the Sun rises and sets. Pathetic as the statement may be these thoughts and those who attempt to pedal their dementia are why their need to be constant reminders and a never-ending availability of books that keep Historical Atrocities current and relevant. It is also why we must always have Authors such as these who have the stamina to document what should require nothing other than acceptance. Why we need these men to sit across from other men while they ridicule a camp survivor who witnessed exactly what the deniers deny.<br />This truly is a remarkable exposition about how real History can be recorded and abused. It answers why the few on the fringe of their created fantasies cannot be ignored, but at the same time demonstrates that nothing requires morally or legally that they be helped to spread their lies. Their freedom to speak and write may cause nausea at the very least, however free speech does not require college newspapers to accept the ads the deniers produce.<br />I also admired the Authors for stepping outside the event that is so much a part of their lives, and to write at length of the Holocaust so well documented in the work, \"The Rape Of Nanking\". The Japanese Government has yet to claim full responsibility for the crimes that Japan committed in WW II. And then there is the Government of Turkey for the slaughter of Armenians and Pontic Greeks, The United State for the 400 years of genocide against Africans and African Americans, and the extermination attempted of The Native Americans. It was just a few months ago that then President Clinton intervened to stop a bill condemning the Turkish Government for continuing to deny their history.<br />I had the privilege to listen to and then speak with Mr. Randall Robinson, an African American, Scholar and Author, and Civil Rights Activist. One of the points he made that evening is that when any part of society denies the History of another group of its citizens, they damage themselves, not just those whose History they seek to deny. To steal, deny, or erase History is to do so for us all, to the detriment of all.<br />I have read dozens of books on this topic, and page for page this is as good as any.<br />We just never seem to learn............", "images": [], "asin": "0520216121", "parent_asin": "0520216121", "user_id": "AESXHXY257AGBUDJRGOPSQPZQC7A", "timestamp": 984191899000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "best heard in context of the times", "text": "This would be best understood after reading Angelique's Descent, which gives the reader a glimpse of the times back then, late 1700s.  I'm not pushing a book.  It can be gotten from the library, even on interlibrary loan, for free.  It's an excellent book - and contrary to bad reviews, there is no freaking porn in the book - it's even tamer than what Kim Harrison writes (Rachel Morgan series).  But the book IS excellent if one reads it carefully and looks up in a dictionary anything they aren't sure of.  I bemoan the fact that most readers of today, younger people especially, might not understand the times and what was considered \"the norm.\"<br /><br />We know from the series that, in the end, B realizes that he loves A and that he always loved A.  He tells her that, as she dies in his arms - she dies de-witched, fully human.  Yet,  in Descent, he recalls saying those words to her, he wonders why he felt it, said it, thought it.  He recalls what he despised about her - one of the things being her descent, parantage, etc. - things that would be of major importance to the aristocrat class or the gentleman class, at the time.  Gentleman was a class, contrary to lower class.  We see that B only even saw Josette once, J was wondering if he's even remember her face!  Throughout their courtship, approved since she was of the aristocratic class, they never even kissed!  Even then, B slaps A in the face with the class thing, bringing up \"officer and servant\" and insinuating that she's had sex with more men than just him (not so).  she rightly calls him a villian.  (Blackguard was the term back then). But read Angelique's Descent.<br /><br />Then listen to this audio play.<br /><br />Imo, J was an air-heady little \"doll\" that knew nothing of the world around her, pampered and spoiled to the max.  Angelique did not get in the way of true love, or harm it.  No.  The times, the morality of the day, the family obligations, the classism of the times, that got in the way of REAL TRUE LOVE, between Angelique and Barnabas.<br /><br />The mores of the times are crucial to understanding this love triangle.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great biography of a strange but entertaining man", "text": "As a boy growing up in Santa Rosa, California, LeRoy Ripley was skinny and awkward.  The painfully shy young man had a talent for cartooning.  When he was nineteen, he left his hometown to draw for newspapers in San Francisco, but everyone he met advised him to move on to New York City.  In 1912, Ripley did, working as a sports journalist and cartoonist.  As the years passed, he began introducing little bits of sports trivia into his cartoons: fastest runners, records set and broken, and suchlike.  By the early 1920s, he was traveling the world and sending dispatches back to his New York papers featuring the strange and delightful wonders he saw on his adventures through Asia and Europe.  His columns and illustrations grew in popularity exponentially, so that by the early 1930s the eccentric cartoonist was one of the wealthiest men in his industry.  As he grew older, he continued to travel, collecting artifacts and unusual items from every corner of the globe.  Ripley's entertainment empire spread into books,\"odditoriums\" (a combination of museum of the weird and freak show), radio and even television.  Often imitated, never duplicated, Robert L. Ripley's life was as strange and unbelievable as the stories he collected.  Neal Thompson's biography of Ripley is the first written in over fifty years, and the only one written with access to the archives of Ripley Entertainment (including many of Ripley's personal papers) and the Doug and Hazel Storer Collection (both Storers were employees of Ripley for many years; Doug was his business manager).<br /><br />If you have ever had the experience of wandering through one of Ripley's Odditoriums, it is impossible not to wonder about the man who helped amass the vast collections.  The rooms are so incredibly random!  In one chamber, medieval instruments of torture are displayed - some are even demonstrated on wax models.  The next room might have the taxidermy remains of a pig with two heads, or the shoes of the world's tallest man.  Another room might have Noh masks from Japan or shrunken heads or bronze Yoruba sculptures.  It's utterly impossible to predict, especially since the collections continue to grow even now, sixty plus years after Ripley's death.<br /><br />Ripley is very much a man of his time, which is to say that things like political correctness wasn't a priority.  He was a very observant man, with great attention to detail when he drew historic costumes or portraits for the newspapers - but he was also a traveler who steadfastly refused to learn even a few words of the native tongue.  He was a lifelong bachelor, although he seemed to like women (especially Asian women).  Towards the end of his life, he was even a bit of a Hugh Hefner figure, always surrounded by beautiful women in his palatial homes and on his travels.  Thompson makes no attempt to hide Ripley's flaws, and it is perhaps because he has so many of them that he remains sympathetic.<br /><br />As he grows older, Ripley surrounds himself with stuff and people, but he remains the lonely man unable to fill an inner void.  He reminds me not of the great explorers like Mallory or Shackleton, but of Jay Gatsby, the flamboyantly wealthy party host that everybody knows but no one is close to.  Ripley also reminds me a bit of Walt Disney - both men were artists who created media empires by pushing their way to the top of their mediums; for Ripley this was the newspaper comic, while Disney became the king of animation.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading learning more about Ripley, since I've been to a couple of the Ripley's museums (in Los Angeles, CA and in Orlando, FL) and find it mind-boggling that someone would manage to accumulate so much stuff.  The biography humanized Ripley without painting over his obvious eccentricity, and it made me want to visit another of his Odditoriums.", "images": [], "asin": "077043620X", "parent_asin": "077043620X", "user_id": "AHX25MN3P7B6FZCQIZDBLBNIGKZQ", "timestamp": 1367980772000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Don't let the fringe scare you away from this!", "text": "Please bear with me, as I hop on my soap-box for a minute. I promise I'll review the book -<br /><br />WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?<br /><br />*ahem*, I'll try that again...<br /><br />First, let me get the AA piece out of the way. My name is Steve, and I am a Democrat. (\"Hi, Steve!\")<br /><br />Does that really even matter? No. It shouldn't. I'm not a Communist, Marxist, (yadda-yadda), but I have Democratic morals. So what, right? Here's my point - yes it IS possible to be a Democrat and still love this book. Why? Well because this is just FICTION. Yes, the future in this novel is bleak and scary, yes the political leanings in this book are certainly towards the right, yes some of the characters are racist - WHO CARES! This is still a very well-written book with tons of intrigue, mystery, the whole nine.<br /><br />Dan took what was in his mind a possible scenario, and wrote a fictional novel out of it set in a dystopian America. Authors have been doing this for years. This does NOT mean that Dan is a crazy, racist, wing-nut blah-blah-blah. If that were the case then the author of the dystopian work 'A Clockwork Orange', Anthony Burgess, is truly one sick puppy - but people still love his work! (myself being one of these people)<br /><br />Here's the problem: more and more people are polarized because of political differences. It's almost like religion to some people, so when someone comes up with an opposing viewpoint people get extremely 'butt-hurt' (sorry, not a tactful term, but accurate). So, if you are the type to get 'butt-hurt' over differing political ideals then this book is not for you - go back to reading dystopian works about anarchist children, serial rapists, etc. However, if you are able to set political differences aside and just enjoy a nice work of dystopian fiction, regardless if you're a Democrat or Republican, or in between, then by all means check this book out!<br /><br />I have been slammed defending this book by other reviewers in the comments of other reviews, essentially being called a DINO (Democrat In Name Only) just because I enjoyed this book. Odd that reviewers like these will then say 'Well, it's not the politics that bother me, it's that the writing is poor!'. Bull. If you weren't so 'butt-hurt' by the political aspects then why would the favorable opinion of mine, a Democrat, even matter to you! Gah! So frustrating! IT'S FICTION PEOPLE! People say 'Well, just read the first line in the book - that is proof that this book was written poorly!' Hey, how about reading the rest of the lines, eh? This book was NOT written poorly. I'm sure I could dig through any of Dan's books and find lines that aren't written perfectly. Who cares. By the way, the first sentence is \"'You're probably wondering why I asked you to come here today, Mr. Bottom' said Hiroshi Nakamura.\" (Ooh - the horror, right?)<br /><br />(Okay, breathe easy)<br /><br />Alright, I'm off the soap box now. So here's the review, as promised:<br /><br />Former Denver detective Nick Bottom lives in a very broken America. We have gone bankrupt. America has become ripe for the pickins for the Caliphate, Japanese, Mexicans, etc. Suicide bombings are common, stadiums are used to house prisoners, we are down to 44 states, our military has long been stretched WAY too thin. Essentially, we are helpless. Instead of trying to do something productive about it, most citizens have become addicted to a cheap drug called Flashback.<br /><br />Flashback is an interesting drug. This drug allows you to live vicariously through your former-self. You inhale the drug, focus on a memory and the drug will take you there, allowing you to relive that moment. You are still aware of your current-self while on the drug.<br /><br />Former detective Nick Bottom has lost his wife. Like many others, he is addicted to Flashback, which caused him to lose his job. Money is so hard to come by, which is doubly-painful when you have an addiction. A very powerful Japanese dignitary named Nakamura offers Nick enough money to feed his Flashback addiction for life if Nick can solve the murder of Nakamura's son. This seems like an impossible task, the case has been cold for six years and Nick wasn't able to solve it before - nobody can seem to solve it. Nick is also trying to solve the murder of his wife.<br /><br />Making matters worse, Nick's teenage son Val wants nothing to do with him. He lives with his Grandfather (Nick's father in-law) in California and he belongs to a flashgang. Flashgangs commit heinous crimes, and because they are twisted people they flash back to said crimes (rape, murder, etc).<br /><br />That's about as much as I'm going to give away as far as plot.<br /><br />This book, like the drug, is ADDICTING! For a Simmons novel this one moves incredibly brisk. Little-by-little the mystery moves closer to resolution as we see the story unfold from a couple different angles. One thread follows Nick, another his son Val. Simmons leaves little cliffhangers throughout making it downright impossible to put down at times.<br /><br />Okay, there is a little bit of beef, so I couldn't give it the full five stars...<br /><br />Many of the characters aren't fleshed out as well as those found in Simmons' other work. I wouldn't go as far as to say they are 'cardboard' or whatever, but this is no Carrion Comfort, which has AMAZING characters. Also, though the end is good, it doesn't quite meet the potential it had given how intriguing the rest of the story is. There are also a couple areas that seem a little too 'convenient', but it is rare, and I don't want to go into those for risk of spoiling important plot elements. The problem is that Simmons puts himself on his own scale - it's hard to give this one a five when he has such jaw-dropping books under his belt like Hyperion and Carrion Comfort. That being said, this book is still good. Very good.<br /><br />So, if you can get over the political aspects of this book then certainly check it out. I actually found the political aspects interesting, even if my own political beliefs don't align with those in this book. Besides, over 90% of this book surrounds the murder mystery, this isn't \"pages and pages of extreme right-wing rhetoric\" like many reviewers are trying to lead you to believe. I question if many of the reviewers here have actually read this book!", "images": [], "asin": "0316006963", "parent_asin": "0316006963", "user_id": "AH7XO376URXXCSK332KEPQOX4CKA", "timestamp": 1310680554000, "helpful_vote": 125, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Enjoyed the story until the end", "text": "I really love reading thriller books, and the plot and cover of this book drew me in immediately. It's about a young boy named Wink, and two young girls named Poppy and Midnight. Midnight is a nice, caring boy who is in love with Poppy, a cruel and bitter bully. He moves next to Wink, who is shy, sweet, and genuine who he then falls in love with too. It is almost a love triangle between the three. Poppy threatens Midnight that she is jealous of Wink and wants to set up a cruel prank for her and that he better join in with her. But Wink and Midnight decide to get back at Poppy and plot a elaborate revenge prank for her. After that happens, things start to get weird. I understood most of the story until the end, and then it got disjointed and very confusing. I did not like the twist AT ALL, it was not what I was expecting and was really cruel. Made me dislike the characters even more than I already did. No questions were answered, and not a lot of backstory about the ending and the choices made.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic account of life in a leper colony", "text": "Molokai is a wonderful example of how to write a great historical fiction novel.  The author has taken a very difficult subject matter, leprosy, and given the reader a wonderful insight into the human aspects of being a leper.<br /><br />The story takes place in a leper colony founded by Father Damien.  Kalaupapa, a town on Molokai, is a sterile and inhospitable place when Father Damien started the colony so that he could minister to the lepers.  This story does not occur during that difficult time.  Instead, we see the life of a leper through the eyes of a Hawaiian girl as she grows from a seven year old into a 50 something adult.  We see the lows, highs, and in-between times.<br /><br />I found this novel to be a sad story but very enlightening and positive.  The writing almost makes you feel like you are in Kalaupapa.  The story really shines when Rachel finally gets paroled and is free to leave the colony.  What she does once leaving is truly heartfelt.<br /><br />I was raised in Hawaii during the 50's and 60's and was well aware of Kalaupapa.  This book reminded me of the time I grew up on Oahu.  I remember many of the things done by Rachel.  I even sailed on the Lurline from Hawaii to California just like Rachel.  I loved this book and it is a great book to read.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A harrowing and honest self-examination", "text": "Dwight \"Doc\" Gooden's memoir about his history of drug and alcohol abuse is a harrowing tale that pulls no punches. I knew that Gooden had struggled with his addictions, but until I read this book, I didn't realize just how bad his addictions were (Gooden only became truly clean and sober two years ago). So many celebrity autobiographies attempt to whitewash bad deeds and pass off blame on others. Gooden, however, takes responsibility for his actions and makes no excuses for himself.<br /><br />Gooden's baseball days are a very small part of this memoir. In fact, his discussion of his career is merely part of the setting for the larger narrative of how he sank into the depths of addiction and then slowly (very slowly) made his way back to sobriety. If you are looking for a book that goes into Gooden's pitching career in great detail, then this isn't the book for you.<br /><br />The memoir is relentless in showing Gooden's numerous binges, half-hearted attempts at rehabilitation, run-ins with the law, and his family and friends' desperate attempts to help him get sober. At the midpoint of the memoir, the reader begins to wonder how Gooden managed to survive his addictions. Gooden recounts with brutal honesty how his substance abuse cost him his career, two marriages, his relationships with his children, his money, and, ultimately, his freedom when he was sent to prison. To his credit, Gooden is brutally honest about himself and shows that while he is basically a good person, he did some awful things to himself and those who loved and cared for him. I cringed every time Gooden let his demons get the better of him, but I never stopped rooting for him.", "images": [], "asin": "0544027027", "parent_asin": "0544027027", "user_id": "AGVHFLW26YJZTZAXQIN4DZ2AV4DA", "timestamp": 1372700432000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

Yes, and 'Keepers' proves it.  Gary Braunbeck has an extraordinary talent for taking you into parts of the mind that ebb and flow with surreal horror and unbearable charm, twisting emotion into intricately woven braids of thought, imagination, and lurid reality.<br /><br />'Keepers' is so much more than the blurb on the back cover, it has a haunting 'coming of age' tale so poignantly detailed that I forgot I was reading a horror book.  But nothing makes charm more vivid than the red-rimmed eyes of an unseen menace creeping up behind you.<br /><br />Gil Stewart is an ordinary man, running his own business of 'novelties and collectibles' stores, and caring for his institutionalized Down's Syndrome nephew, Carson, one week a month.  Until one day his normal life is shattered, first by witnessing a bizarre death on the highway, then by a mangy dog crawling under his house to die, and lastly a phone call from the institution telling him Carson is missing.<br /><br />It's time to Gil to remember his past, to piece together the fragments of his memories in order to discover the secret of the Keepers, and why the Magritte-Man killed on the highway warned him of them.  Gil must remember his parents, and the unbreakable bond he formed with Beth, his girl of the past, long missing and presumed dead.  He must remember his kindnesses, to animals and elderly and all those who are invisible to the rest of the world.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Well-paced Suspense Novel Told in Dual Timelines", "text": "I can't imagine reading All The Dangerous Things by Stacy Willingham as a mother of little children! It was hard enough as a grandmother of very young children.<br /><br />The premise: Isabelle Drake is living a parent's worst nightmare. Her toddler son Mason was taken from his crib in the middle of the night while she and her husband slept in the room next door.  The police investigation found no answers, and a year later, Isabelle's life is falling apart. Her husband left her, she literally can't sleep, and her sole focus is desperately searching for information about Mason and his abductor.  The story is told with extensive flashbacks to Isabelle's childhood with her parents and sister which add a second mystery to the plot.<br /><br />Reading Willingham's newest suspense novel annually in January is a welcome change from the sweet and sentimental novels I tend to read in December. I don't read a lot of suspense/thrillers, but I liked A Flicker in the Dark last January and this title as well.  This had a strong sense of place in both storylines, and the visits to Isabelle's childhood and the pacing made this unique for me. I wouldn't classify this as a fast-paced thriller, and most of the characters are hard to like.<br /><br />Thank you to Macmillan Audio for complimentary access to the audiobook, narrated by Karissa Vacker.", "images": [{"attachment_type": "IMAGE", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p4kNmINqL._SL1600_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p4kNmINqL._SL800_.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p4kNmINqL._SL256_.jpg"}], "asin": "B0B1KRQ11G", "parent_asin": "B0B1KRQ11G", "user_id": "AEGKZZQUR4HZFH4ADLQMBZLAJUNQ", "timestamp": 1674509485898, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A treasure trove...", "text": "For some reason, I have always had a fascination with obituaries and I believe they include some of the best writing to be found in newspapers.  I jumped at the opportunity to order The New York Times Book of the Dead: 320 Print and 10,000 Digital Obituaries of Extraordinary People, edited by William McDonald.  This book is a treasure trove and a look back at the lives of many important people extending over 100 years.<br /><br />The Book of the Dead is divided into sections including The World Stage, American Leaders, Warriors, The Old West, Stage and Screen, and the Literary World\u2014to mention just a few.  Many are individuals who died before I was even born.  Some are people that I don\u2019t remember having died.  Where can you find a book that includes death notices of notable people from Otto Von Bismarck to Satchel Paige to Frank Sinatra? What makes these obituaries especially enjoyable and thought provoking are the little gems you can find in them.  The Times doesn\u2019t sugar-coat circumstances and situations\u2014even if some believe that you shouldn\u2019t speak ill of the dead.  Mel Gussow writes of Tennessee Williams \u201cHe produced an enormous body of work, including more than two dozen full-length plays, all of them produced, a record unequaled by any of his contemporaries.  There were successes and failures, and often great disagreement over which was which.\u201d  About Marlon Brandon, Rick Lyman writes \u201c\u201dhe was brooding, muscular and intense.  Detractors called him a slob.  He appeared in tight blue jeans and torn T-shirts, grimy with sweat, alternately slack-jawed with stupidity and alive with feral cunning.  And he was more openly sexual, in an animal way, than the actors who immediately proceeded him\u201d<br /><br />My one complaint about The Book of the Dead is that this book is a monster.  At 12\u201d by almost 8\u201d and weighing maybe 4 pounds, it\u2019s not the kind of book you can read propped up in bed.  But at least you can read a few obits at a sitting and not have to tackle the entire book at once.  Also, while I read all 320 obituaries listed in the book, I have yet to read the 10,000 digital death notices that are on the included in the web key.<br /><br />I have a feeling that The Book of the Dead will be a book that will become a handy reference book that I will come back to again and again.", "images": [], "asin": "0316395471", "parent_asin": "0316395471", "user_id": "AFI7YILO4JRFKRXQXGDBHDIYZVVQ", "timestamp": 1485359914000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Every chapter/section ends in such a way that it makes it difficult to stop turning pages. The setting is great and felt like a Get Out and Riverdale combo. The social commentary is undeniable.<br /><br />The mystery itself was a bit lack luster. There are a couple good twists, but it was more a matter of seeing how things unfold than figuring out whodunnit. I really liked the main characters, but felt like Devon\u2019s was so much more fleshed out and interesting than Chiamaka\u2019s. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of how much time was spent on their love lives. It didn\u2019t fit in well with the main plot.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Terrific Sense of Place & Time", "text": "Bruce Machart's \"The Wake of Forgiveness\" tells the story of a rebellious son born to a mother who dies during his birth.  The book is set in three time periods (1895, 1910, and 1924) and starts with the birth of Karel Skala and the death of his mother Klara.  Klara's death sets the father of Karel (and three other sons) reeling.  He takes to drink, gambles, and is basically a lousy and overbearing presence in the life of the boys.  The story then jumps to 1910 and a bet on a horse race and moves to 1924 to Karel as an adult still struggling with the loss of his mother, a girl, and the difficulty of dealing with his brothers and father.  Machart jumps back in forth between events in 1910 and 1924 with great success as he tells this story of marginal redemption.<br /><br />The author does a great job of evoking time (early 20th century) and place (Texas).  He's got a good story and he tells it well.  On the down side, none of the characters is remotely likable (with the possible exception of a nursemaid or the dead mother, neither of whom plays much of a role in this book).  There are few redeeming qualities to any of the characters and although the reader might find some redemption along the way, the story is not very uplifting.  Still, it's a beautifully written book and even features some references to Shiner beer.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved this book!", "text": "This book was very poignant and moving. I found Mike to be a complex and sympathetic character. I was so into the story that when I would set it aside, I felt as if I could not talk because I had been so inside of Mike's head.<br /><br />I loved learning Mike's story in bits and pieces as he would flashback. Then it would make his current story that much more clear.<br /><br />Mike is a good guy, a kid really, doing the wrong things for the right reasons. His relationship with Amelia is very touching and the way he uses art to communicate with her was sweet.<br /><br />Hamilton is an amazing writer and really captured not only the character of Mike but the descriptions of Mike with the locks were just perfect.<br /><br />  Would I ever have found that moment? Those metal pieces, which are so hard and unforgiving, so carefully designed not to move...Yet somehow with just the right touch it all lines up and God, that one second when it opens. That smooth, sudden, metallic release. The sound of it turning and the way it feels in your hands. They way it feels when something is locked up so tight in a metal box, with no way to get out. When you finally open it... When you finally learn how to unlock that lock... Can you even imagine how that feels?<br /><br />I could not read this book fast enough though I really wanted to savor it. This is definitely a book I would highly recommend. I really loved it. I think it is already one of my favorite books of 2011.<br /><br />my rating 5/5", "images": [], "asin": "B002ZW7EBE", "parent_asin": "B002ZW7EBE", "user_id": "AECQQBG6YRYCOJL2NCB2H3V6LD6Q", "timestamp": 1295831446000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

The advanced copy I received was a few months ago, so most of the editorial errors should be fixed in this copy. The premise was intriguing, and the story was one I haven't seen yet. If you don't truly enjoy Quentin Tarantino movies, you will not like this book. There are so many different time lines, time jumps, character viewpoints, and subplots it will make your head spin. If, however, you do love Tarantino style craziness you will love this book. The plot kept a good pace, and had a great mix of sci-fi, dystopian, action, and romance elements, with subtle undertones of Lovecraftian horror, to please any genre-lover.

I purchased Dashiell Hammett: A Daughter Remembers thinking that it was going to be an in-depth biography about Dashiell Hammett.  Instead, it is a short book filled with remembrances of her dad that are short snippets and stories and anecdotes.  While the book is filled with many wonderful photos, the story skips around a bit and Jo Hammett doesn't delve into any one topic (early years, married life, Lillian Hellman, service years, prision time, etc.) in any great detail.  Still, Hammett was a very fascinating character and his daughter tries to give us just a little insight into the real man.  She also tries to separate some of the Hammett-myth that was created and perpetuated by long-time friend and lover, Lillian Hellman.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Twisted, demented, and thoroughly engrossing!", "text": "The title of this book is a perfect representation of what\u2019s between the pages. It is twisted, horrifying, raw, and it shines a light into all those dark corners we all want to pretend don\u2019t exist. Oh, but they do.<br /><br />The story is told in two timelines, the present day and 1985, when Ben Day murdered his mother and two sisters, leaving Libby the sole survivor besides Ben himself. Not surprisingly, Libby\u2019s life has been anything but idyllic.<br /><br />Libby\u2019s character is interesting, although I know a lot of readers may not connect with her. She\u2019s imperfect, with qualities that, on the surface, may be unlikable. Does she do things that would be easy to condemn? Absolutely, but there\u2019s still something about her that makes you care, makes you understand why she is the way she is. Even before the murder of her family, Libby\u2019s life was difficult. The added trauma at such a young change has irrevocably changed her. To me, that makes her sympathetic. This is a girl who\u2019s grown into womanhood alone, with little to no real support. She\u2019s lost, alone, completely unprepared for life. It made me feel for her, to want more for her, even if she is a bit on the emotionally deranged side.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I had all kinds of theories as to where the story was leading. But I was wrong every single time. The book is deliciously demented in so many ways. There are times when the story edges toward unbelievable, yet even in those moments, it\u2019s entirely imaginable. Sometimes, there was an almost palpable level of discomfort with the dark, disturbing moments, but yet it\u2019s impossible to turn away from it!", "images": [], "asin": "B0027MJU00", "parent_asin": "B0027MJU00", "user_id": "AGRO6QFEG7B24PHASNKCE3TJIHWA", "timestamp": 1647027181068, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
