I would be so excited to read the adventures of Archie and friends (Veronica, Betty, Jughead, Big Moose, Reggie, Miss Grundy, and Mr. Weatherbee). After a while, I stopped collecting the comics and moved on to literature. But the famous comic that started in 1941 is still going strong.<br /><br />While browsing Amazon.com, I came across a new release: The Best of Archie Comics. This was a must have! I immediately purchased a copy. It features the best stories of the past 70 years! It is in full color and designed for both young and old Archie fans. It highlights the eternal love triangle (Archie/Betty/Veronica). It's also a great introduction if you're not familiar with the Riverdale gang because it covers the 1940s to 2010 and beyond. If you look closely, you'll notice the price change. In the 1940s when Archie first began, it only cost ten cents. The comics are categorized by decade with a brief description of the American culture at that time. A history lesson AND memories!<br /><br />As a bonus, it includes comics from the spinoffs like Josie & The Pussycats and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. My only gripe is the spine. I had to bend the spine back further to read some of the pages. A hardcover version would have been better. So I would suggest purchasing two copies: one copy for reading, one copy for the collection.<br /><br />Literary Marie", "images": [], "asin": "1879794845", "parent_asin": "1879794845", "user_id": "AGNHIGVEK22ETBK54YKFL2TFIU6Q", "timestamp": 1319920807000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

I LOVED \"Patchwork Puzzle Balls\", bought a book on Temari (the threaded balls) and didn't like that one bit. Kimekomi - Japanese for \"tuck in\" - is very cool and fast fun if you're into instant gratification! :) Also called quilt balls, these make fun tree ornaments or bowl/table accents.<br /><br />The short version? Take a smooth foam ball, use a hot knife to cut your crevices/tuck lines, cut little fabric shapes slightly larger than the lined areas, and you guessed it, tuck it in the slit! My first attempts using an exacto knife and a butter knife for tucking came out OK but had the down comforter puffy look.  Do it the \"right\" way with a hot knife and tucking tool and it comes out a thousand times better, neater, and  smooth like the photos.<br /><br />Tool & Supply tips:<br /><br />A \"hot knife\" is basically a not-so-sharp exacto knife tip on either a woodburning tool or the mini craft iron II, you might even have it already if you own either of those tools. Makes a nice, straight and smooth cut in the styrofoam ball. That was a new tool term for me so I went running around looking for something by that name before having a Duh! moment.<br /><br />plasteelcorp sells smooth foam balls, any size will do, just remember bigger=heavier if you're doing Christmas ornaments!

Ms. Carez did present a tale suited to just this after I gave up worrying on whether I had the right pronunciation of the language used. I felt my frustration with Ellseyan as her story unfolded and her path crossed with Marsem in an unexpected way, and the family bond and loyalty she shares with her brother. She can be related to by many as she is considered an `outcast' in her family. Despite the small frustrations that I encountered, this story was fast-paced, full of action during fighting scenarios, offers a love story and if one notices, a bit of spiritual enlightenment. I did find myself unable to put the book down as I was anxious to see what would happen next. This tale sets up perfectly for the next book to come in a way as I for one was left in suspense in my desire to know more of the main characters trials to encounter.<br /><br />The down-side of `P&ugrave;qest Book 1: The Hunter\" for me was not that the author created a new world of un-ending possibilities, it was the `created' words (or language) was used often, and a small few were left undefined. A pronunciation key to know how to interpret the words would have helped me, personally to understand how to interpret the words. A handful of sentences had me wondering what was occurring or being expressed. I feel that Ms. Carez may risk others whom could also become confused, or put the tale down and move on. Until I decided just to `flow' with it and read the language without special attention, other than looking in the glossary when necessary, then I was able to get an understanding of what was being told and enjoyed it. As this story is taking place in another world or planet, I personally would have liked a `foreword' or similar to perhaps give us, the readers, a clear understanding (Think of Tolkien and preface for the Lord of the Rings.) of the place, history and time era.", "images": [], "asin": "0982265204", "parent_asin": "0982265204", "user_id": "AGSMD2QU35CVAPZTFH5WM3SZN3BQ", "timestamp": 1274833850000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

This is quite different from the cases of military or art history, for example.<br />Which is why this book is helpful. No one can seriously consider the history of the twentieth century without looking at the vast transformation of businesses and the marketplace which have taken place in this period.<br />The 300-odd pages contain photographs and articles from the New York Times which sweep through major epsiodes of twentieth century business including trust busting, the Great Depression, the electronics revolution, and mega-mergers at the close of the century. The articles are accompanied by commentary from the married couple who are the authors, both of whom have been business writers for the New York Times.<br />Whether you are a student doing research for a high school paper, or a policy maker who wants a quick reminder of the events and forces which have shaped business in this century, you will find this book highly readable and informative. In the introductory words of former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, &quot;Rereading history may never subtitute fully for personal experience in shaping our behavior. But there is something to the admonition of one of the 20th century's leading philosphers, George Santayana, about the importance of understanding the past. And this book surely brings our economic history alive.&quot;", "images": [], "asin": "0071355898", "parent_asin": "0071355898", "user_id": "AF3F7Z67NSEQGN2X6GFOKYJRLUJQ", "timestamp": 1062047960000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

But, that's where the positives end. I don't feel that Marcelo is the best character for this story's plot. It seems as though Stork already had a legal drama story ready to go and tried to push Marcelo in, even though he doesn't fit. I just don't see how Marcelo being autistic adds anything to the story, except validating confusing dialog where I have to step back and map out who is saying what, because the total absence of pronouns, while perhaps characteristic of autism, works against the reader in a literary form. If the story was just about Marcelo living his everyday life, it would be a refreshing change of pace, but putting him into this story creates a convoluted mash-up of under developed plot lines. The story leads you in one direction, only to completely abandon that path and pick up another in the opposite direction. Not like plot twists, but more like following a fly across the room, watching it randomly buzz about without any real direction. Stork sets the story up in one direction and then switches it to irrelevant, tangential plot lines. It is clear from the beginning what the \"result\" of his experience will be.

Why is that bad?  It means that if you  want to look up a word that reoccurs about hundred times throughout the text your only other option is to leaf through each page individually.

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "Gasoline, Sparks, and Fire", "text": "One of the most thought provoking books I've read in a long time, Scott Berkun's Mindfire is well worth an investment of your time. From the title(based on Emerson's reference to the creative mind as a fire) to the epilogue, the book is filled with essays about topics of interest to any and all readers who are willing to truly \"think\" about where their ideas came from and perhaps even be willing to challenge them. For starters, there's the essay entitled \"How to Be a Free Thinker,\" a personal favorite.<br /><br />The writing is clear, crisp, and easy to understand. As a psychology instructor at a community college, I'm accustomed to reading texts and other types of psychological literature that is often pedantic and ponderous. Berkun's writing is so refreshing juxtaposed to my usual fare! Simple and deep at the same time, the essays provoked my thinking without using a lot of obscure jargon.<br /><br />As a teacher, I'm always on the prowl for ideas to use in my classes, and I found several in Mindfire. For starters, I used this quote as a discussion prompt when covering factors affecting longevity: \"A funny thing about the human mind is that it tends to believe what it wants to believe....We worry about snakes, or getting on airplanes, when the real threats to longevity are cheeseburgers, chocolate shakes and long hours lounging on the couch.\" While the text said basically the same way, it didn't carry quite the same punch.<br /><br />All of the essays are fantastic, and I hope to incorporate ideas from them into my courses next semester...and into my thinking for the rest of my life.", "images": [], "asin": "0983873100", "parent_asin": "0983873100", "user_id": "AGYHMKSBOIWRHRTYZ3RVPQVBQ5LA", "timestamp": 1343995748000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

This one took me a little longer to get into because at the beginning there are points of view from characters unknown & unnamed on planets never heard of and in the past. I felt a bit disconnected and took in the information like one does all info dumps thinking that this is probably important to what's coming but this isn't making it a riveting read by any means. Things improved greatly when Noelle & Miles are back on the scene and it's clear that the story is firmly planted on the Moon. That's kind of what I'm here for. I liked meeting the mayor Arek Soseki and hope he's around for future books (perhaps as the governor-general because he had better foresight than the current one).<br /><br />There was a detailed conspiracy going on concerning Etae and their bid to become part of Earth Alliance that was so multilayered I'm not exactly sure I've got all the details worked out. Suffice it to say, many threads were related and culminated in multiple murders, rioting and some serious terrorist activity that damaged the Dome and killed a bunch of people. The descriptions of that were unsettling. Also in the unsettling category was the way the media & corporate influence played a pivotal role in social sway and political shifts. It was an all too timely reminder of our modern age.<br /><br />As always, Miles & Noelle get the job done in the end but this time they ended a lot farther from one another as the line that is the solitary life of a Retrieval Artist, has been underscored. I'm a little sad about that but I do look forward to seeing how their cases intersect in future books.

This non-fiction narrative reads like a novel; I could hardly put it down until I got through the third appendix. But \"Hope and a Future\" actually is a biography. It\u2019s the kind of profile we rarely encounter in literature - a deeply moving narrative whose final chapters have yet to be written. Higdon chronicles the story of a \u201cstreet boy\u201d coming of age in and around a vast Nairobi shantytown. We meet his family, friends, and many of those who either pulled him up or dragged him down. Yet it\u2019s more than a biography. It\u2019s a well-researched introduction to the social conditions that govern the day-to-day survival of immensely resourceful children in urban Africa. It\u2019s a graphic depiction of dangers and tragedies that relentlessly stalk street children, but it\u2019s also a story of resilience, loyalty and imagination. And if that weren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s a genuine morality tale, a hero\u2019s journey, a depiction of true community in dire circumstances. \"Hope and a Future\" simultaneously entertains, engages, informs and inspires. It also is being used to jump-start an imaginative initiative, Little Boost Press, to help children in situations like the one described in the book.

I am not sure, things are said and I was supposed to understand how we got from point a to point b.  Were the aliens bad or good.

The author would be well served by taking a close look at how other proven writers, such as David Sedaris, are able to find a way to provide extremely visual descriptions without seeming to put the word \"like\" in every other sentence.

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "P.G. Wodehouse meets Dr. Who: a complete pleasure", "text": "If you got P.G. Wodehouse to write a Dr. Who script you might come up with something like this. Why not? Apparently as well as script editing for series 17 (featuring, for example, 'City of Death' where John Cleese is an art dealer), Adams wrote a couple of episodes ('The Pirate Planet', and the unfinished 'Shada' which featured none other than Prof. 'Reg' Chronitis and his TARDIS style study). Sorry, enough trainspotting (thanks G &amp; J).<br />The Dr. Who thing only hit me late in the book, but that's partly because 'Dirk Gently' only pops up about half way through, and he's most enjoyably reminiscent of Tom Baker in his distracted purposefulness. I suppose there's something of Ford Prefect there too, and other elements of Hitch Hikers - yet another confused alien species looking to earth as an Eden and changing the deep past and whole evolution of humanity. And I suppose Richard could be played by whoever was DentArthurDent in the TV show.<br />But, hey, this isn't having a go at the book, which is sheer pleasure to read. It's not at all a cheap carbon of earlier Adams, there's just some lovely echoes. The guy just writes so wonderfully - like Wodehouse - and the dialogue is full of good (frightfully British) humour and character. Moreover the comic observations on the everyday are clever and flawlessly executed. The setting is surprisingly coherent when you get down to it (I *love* the way he casually resolves the sofa paradox that's been running through the whole book) - there's really nothing I can think of to complain about with it. I'm used to books lifting me up and then disappointing, but this manages to ebulliently float you along from start to finish.<br />I'm so glad I decided to start rereading books. It must be over a decade since I'd read this and I only had the vaguest recollection of some of the key images. But the chief pleasure of Adams can't be reduced to, say, the plot line, which, while fine, is in one way incidental (i.e. the characters and dialogue are good enough to stand alone). I get the impression he was in a fairly positive state of mind when he wrote this (as opposed to Mostly Harmless), and in excellent form, so these character's are simply pleasant to be with - as well as being hilarious and - as with those of Pratchett on a good day - charming.", "images": [], "asin": "0671746723", "parent_asin": "0671746723", "user_id": "AEY3JAK2RQYMS7V66IW2AFE7DI7Q", "timestamp": 1089258064000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "essence of religion", "text": "This book is the reason that Sam Harris has always been my favorite of the New Atheists. He recognizes and practices what I always called the essence of religion. Stated simply, if you meditate, pray, fast, ingest certain substances, you can experience self-transcendence. Most of the major religions have a name for this experience... enlightenment, nirvana, satori, samadhi, state of grace. The beauty of Sam's book is that he cuts through the trappings of religious dogma and new age mysticism that tend to cloud the experience. This is especially an important book for those unfamiliar with this phenomenon, and can hopefully lead some to a path of self discovery. As more of us learn to quiet the ego, this will become a much better world.", "images": [], "asin": "1451636024", "parent_asin": "1451636024", "user_id": "AHKIG3Y7GB7BI62FHEA7R5OHIIRA", "timestamp": 1496421843000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}
{"label": 1, "rating": 5.0, "title": "Most frequently used cook book I own", "text": "About four or five years ago I took a couple of hour class from the author, Suvir Saran, at Sur La Table in Portland, Oregon.  Since then I've made 35 recipes out of \"Indian Home Cooking\" - which may not seem like a lot, but when you consider that I eat out more than 50% of the time and I don't think I've made more than 10 recipes from any other cook book I have ever owned - not to mention that there are a few of the recipes that I like so much that I tend to make them repeatedly (grape raita, stir fried green beans with coconut, stir-fried carrots with cumin and lime, coconut chicken with cashews, ground turkey with spinach and whole spices, and mangalore fried shrimp), 35 recipes actually is pretty good!  Tonight I made three that I hadn't tried before:  the red kidney beans with ginger, tomato and curry leaves; green chutney; and onion pachadi.  As usual they were all wonderful - although I probably didn't pick the best complements since all three have lots of onions in them.  I'm hoping to try another 30 recipes in this book by the end of the year.  Making things from this cookbook is one of my favorite simple pleasures in life, particularly when we have friends over to share the deliciousness.<br /><br />Before Suvir Saran introduced me to Indian cooking, I was intimidated by it.  While I loved going out for Indian food, there were such varied and unrecognizable flavors to me that I couldn't even imagine how the dishes were made.  Yet, once I started making Saran's easy-to-follow recipes I found that it really isn't difficult at all.  In fact, I now understand the basic cooking techniques and spices well enough that I can look in my refrigerator to see what ingredients I have and then improv something using Indian spices and cooking techniques and end up with something that tastes great.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian and have always felt sorry for my vegetarian friends because of how much they were missing out on the flavors and variety of an omnivore diet.  In fact, often when I ate vegetarian meals in the past I felt unsatisfied.  Yet, if I were to cook out of \"Indian Home Cooking\" every day, I could easily be a vegetarian and not feel like I was missing out on anything.  The flavors are varied and interesting enough that I don't feel the need to necessarily include meat dishes in meals.  When I do cook an Indian meal, frequently the meat dishes are a small part of the meal, rather than the focal point.  I guess what I'm saying is that when I cook out of \"Indian Home Cooking\" I tend to eat more vegetables and less meat - which is a far healthier diet.  If I could only keep one cook book of any type of cuisine, \"Indian Home Cooking\" would be it.", "images": [], "asin": "0609611011", "parent_asin": "0609611011", "user_id": "AGAWUCJOGCXIBEFRISNDLBNZV4LQ", "timestamp": 1302798163000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
