I have no time for this because I want a better scientific approach to this . He has a couple of better light meters brands and he does not even use them as he said in his book . I suspect he does n't know how to effectively use them when he described his approach . My gosh , I ca nt believe this considering that he has written a number of Photography books and is considered as an expert in this field .",

I was impressed by the surreal , almost dreamlike atmosphere created in Stammlager 76 . The story left me with more questions than answers but I had a good time reading it . The Man in the Dark Chocolate Suit was also surreal and quite unsettling and intense . I loved the sense of foreboding created . We of the Future are the Ghosts of the Past is also effective and my favorite in the collection . This story is also surreal and a little bit creepy . I thought it was great .

I wish I had found out the fate of every character but in the end the broader story was worth it . I say this because The Mansion is the exact opposite . It focuses on a very limited cast of characters in one primary setting . The first chapter was a long , painful , repetitive slog with verbose but uninspiring descriptions of roughing it in a cabin where software was being developed . Sometimes they did n't have electricity but somehow they invented something better than Alexa and better than Google . Ok . Sure .

I also did n't like the author 's style of writing . Furthermore , the chapters are not broken down by the name of presidents , so it is difficult to use this book as a cross - reference .

That chapter being helpful , I returned to the beginning of the book to read the whole thing . I quickly found myself skimming the pages and looking for interesting tidbits . Overall , I found the writing style tedious , explanations too long , and the little \" real life stories \" uninteresting . I know this book has many good reviews , so others obviously found what they needed in it . Maybe because I had already read so many books on aging , diet , supplements , disease , et . , I did not find the rest of the book very informative and certainly it was n't a guide . It contains very detailed information on aging and its physiology . I admire Dr. Weil very much , but this book just did n't provide me with the information I was looking for .",

Part of me kept asking , \" And why NOW are we reading some of these old essays ? \" But , since I love Wolfe 's writing , I could forgive him some moments of indulgence . I liked the Bragg piece and the New Yorker bits and the hooking up essay , but some of the other ones are actually dull in parts - except for the writing I guess you 'd say . When Wolfe is at his best , he can rip others to shreds and keep that grin on his face . At his low point , he fails to stimulate much interest in his current rant . I happen to think he excels at pop culture . I wanted more \" hooking up \" essays with his trenchant observations about our culture . Instead , we get more of a random selection of good essays that jump all over the map .",

    "text": "Initial Book of Elena Oliverez Trilogy . This is the first book of Marcia Muller 's Elena Oliverez trilogy , beginning the exploits of her Hispanic art museum curator . The second is \" The Legend of the Slain Soldiers \" and the third and final is \" Beyond the Grave \" coauthored with Bill Pronzini who is now Muller 's husband . Actually , I think this trilogy gets better book by book , so I actually liked this one the least of the 3 . But , it 's interesting to see Muller write of protagonists other than Sharon McCone - demonstrates her breadth of talent . She also authored the Joanna Stark trilogy about an art security expert . This series is heavily into the world of Hispanic art but is heavily dosed with the personalities of its highly divergent characters - highlighting human foibles . It is not a continuing saga like the Stark trilogy , but is connected in time and in the characters involved . Interestingly , Muller gives Elena a cameo appearance in her latest Sharon McCone adventure \" The Dangerous Hour . \" I find Elena to be a very appealing character and admire Muller for delving into a somewhat different world for this trilogy it 's worth reading the entire trilogy . Enjoy !",

It had to be the shortest book of his yet and it felt that way in many respects . The first 75 pages or so was basically a recap of the previous books that I could have done without , which was mostly voiced by Abby Normal the teen goth minion of the main characters from the first two books . Abby 's voice was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me . She was definitely funny and sparky in a good way , but too repetitive with her dialogue and actions . Still , Bite Me was a hilarious Moore novel that probably ranks in the middle of all his books with Lamb being him in top form and Fluke near the bottom for me . The ending also felt too rushed , but there are plenty of vampire kitties and enjoyable dialogue to push all the right buttons . Bite Me also made me realize how much I missed the Emperor of San Francisco . If you are a Moore fan this will be a must for you .",

I do think the book has been overhyped for its inventiveness and the promise - if not the actuality - of the story . I give the audio version 2 stars . The woman who voices Osceola suffers from a case of up speak . Consequently , commas often become question marks . Long sentences seem to cause Sitrick to stumble , and thus there are odd pauses , disconnecting subject and object at times . In addition , there are a number of mispronunciations eg , acreage as \" ache RE age \" that jar the ears .

Harlan Coben is certainly one of our A - list authors were devoured his entire booklist , well over 30 novels so far . While we like his Myron Bolitar series well enough , its these standalone thrillers that typically enjoy our highest ratings . However not so with either his just prior novel Run Away or this one The Boy . We liked the first hundred pages that focused on the boy , aptly named Wilde , and his past and current exploits concerning a missing high school gal . But then the plot descended into political rants about this crooked guy running for President , and some skulduggery and kidnappings associated with that . The story finally got interesting again during the last handful of the 40 chapters , suggesting a lot of filler in between . That said , some unanswered developments might just be a setup for a sequel . This book almost would have made a better novella . Take out the politics , focus on Wilde , and if you need a kidnapping , maybe stick with the girl and her story , and forget about the rest of the characters . We may be in the minority , but to tell the truth , we expected just a little bit better this time out .",

However , what was delivered was a random meandering story with no central plot . The character just kinda show up at the roundhouse , explore something , nothing exciting happens , and they come back home . Rinse and repeat . The administration of the roundhouse seems somewhat implausible for an artifact of such interest to humanity , to be sending out missions haphazardly with what appear to be unqualified characters and unclear goals . Security is terrible . A significant portion of the book is characters whining about how the roundhouse presents a threat rather than an opportunity . It 's like McDevitt is giving the middle finger to the work that he created . I 'm genuinely puzzled why this thing turned out the way it did .

But , it 's interesting to see Muller write of protagonists other than Sharon McCone - demonstrates her breadth of talent . She also authored the Joanna Stark trilogy about an art security expert . This series is heavily into the world of Hispanic art but is heavily dosed with the personalities of its highly divergent characters - highlighting human foibles . It is not a continuing saga like the Stark trilogy , but is connected in time and in the characters involved .

My one big complaint is the flow of the book . It just felt like there were some places where words were n't selected quite right . Almost as if the author had picked out rhyming words and then built the sentences so that the rhymes would land in the right place . There were some definite spots where it felt forced . Overall though , good book . I 'm going to hang onto this one and try again with daughter when she 's a little older .",

There is no storyline . Our kids ages 9 , 6 , and 4 , were all confused . If your looking to teach empathy , I really liked the children book called , Those Shoes . I have no doubt the author had great intentions , and if your planning to use this as a discussion guide with older children , I see it being good for that purpose . My intention was to read my kids a bedtime story about empathy , and this was not good for that .",
