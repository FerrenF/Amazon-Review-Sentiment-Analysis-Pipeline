    "text": "not as compelling as her first book . I be a clinical psychologist , and I really enjoy author Gretchen Rubin 's first book the happiness project . I appreciate the organization address a different area each month as well as the foundation in research on happiness and well - being . I be hope that Rubin 's next book , well than before , would be a sort of followup . in some way , it be , this time with Rubin more specifically address how to manage habit in order to be more happy and satisfied . unfortunately , I do not like this book nearly as much in fact , I find it be a slog to get through the whole thing . my major problem with this book be something Rubin address in her\"A note to the Reader\"at the start of the book . she says\"I see habit through the lens of my own experience , so this account be color by my particular personality and interest . \" and that be just it -- i. e. , Rubin's\"study\"of habit be almost wholly base on what have work for she and for people she know . her prior book utilize over - frequent quote from her blog this one rely on anecdotal story from her family and friend . Rubin attempt to make her theory adaptable to all by come up with a theory of what she calls\"the four tendencies,\"or basically , four different approach to habit . she call these the Upholder , Questioner , Obliger , and Rebel . I do not find this model , which Rubin refer to throughout the book , to be at all helpful . whereas Rubin may find herself solidly in the\"Upholder\"category , I personally be divide between Upholder and Questioner , and I do not really respond to the suggestion for either . use this basic framework , Rubin go on to create many , many more almost arbitrary category . be you a Lark or an Owl again , I ' m in - between . a Mararthoner , Sprinter , or Procrastinator ? Underbuyer or Overbuyer ? Simplicity Lover or Abundance Lover ? Finisher or Opener ? Familiarity Lover or Novelty Lover ? promotion - Focused or Prevention Focused ? small Steps or big step ? and all of that be only in the second chapter ! it feel very bogged down , confusing , and often irrelevant , at least for I . Rubin go on to address the importance of monitoring habit and to discuss the foundation for create habit . there be some solid , general tip in this section . but eventually , she fall back into create force category , such as the series of\"loopholes,\"or exception to habit . again , there be some good idea here and there , but they tend to get lose among the clutter . one of Rubin 's chapter be called\"Data point of one . \" this be probably the good way to view this book -- that is , as one person 's experience , with suggestion that may or may not relate personally . give both that I do not see an overall general application to Rubin 's theory and that I really do not enjoy this book overall , I would not recommend it .",

I typically get through a book in about 3 hour , but this one just do not grip I like most tend to do . it want bad by any mean . it be just rather dry . perhaps a bit too draw out with the insout of research ? I can not put my finger on it yet . note , I ve not see more than a couple episode of Genealogy Roadshow . I ve not see the episode in which the author appear , so I have not a preference towards what air vs. what s in the book . move on . I find the story premise an interesting one . be a Greek who be the fair member of the family have put I on the receive end of the , what be you ? questionespecially as an awkward look child . it bother I then , especially since I do not understand what be be ask . unfortunately , genealogy itself bore I to tear . I ve actually attempt to do research , however , as a screenwriter , I tend to gravitate towards story that jump off the page . I be unable to feel that , save for very specific part of this book . I feel the author long for question that will forever go unanswered , at least by the woman shed most like to answer they . and yet , just like the author , be leave with enough speculation about people well never know . try to follow the family tree of so so why there important to a person personal narrative be likely incredibly interesting to people naturally interested in genealogy , but for someone like I , speculation bit piece of story fall flat . the author make some excellent point about the way Americans look at discuss race . the book also raise plenty of question that likely will cause the majority of reader to consider as they relate to their own life what they believe ? know vs. the whole truth . in this way , I absolutely find great value in White like she . as a memoir that feel as though it breathe new life in to family member long deceased , well , it do not strike that chord for I . as an only child with one parent in their final month - year of life the other affect by parkinson disease , I have be more interested in family memoir now more than ever before . I would not change have read this , but I also can not say I recommend it above many other . if you love genealogy , this be probably a great choice . if you do not your not interested in try to follow story about how someone mother pass for white , leave her relative to do so later her daughter end up on a quest to tell you why she s look for information on her rd great grandparent and give you seemingly every detail , leave it on the shelf . it may be interesting to some , but most likely the , some , be likely to be relate to you . as its not my family , nor be I genealogy obsess , there be too much tedium not enough meat for my liking .",

I say slowly because I have find that this story have stay with I much long than a Cross novel . this be the type of story that be allow to stew in your mind and grow with time . I highly recommend the Jester . Hugh De Luc play the key role in this novel . an innkeeper with adventurous ambition , Hugh leave his family and home to pursue rich in the Crusades . the Crusade story line do not dominate and should not scare away the casual reader . the setting merely set the stage for Hugh 's acquisition of a relic that be value be unknown to even he . upon Hugh 's return home he find his village in shamble and his family presumably dead . this set in motion the key storyline of the Jester as Hugh go in search of those responsible for ruin his life . a David vs. Goliath revenge story unfold with Hugh resort to any mean necessary to get close to those responsible for his pain , even resort to take up the role of a jester . here be able to gain the trust of those responsible and devise a plot worthy of the pain he have endure . along the way Hugh gain ally and uncover truth beyond his imagination . Patterson 's imagery and detail pull you into the story as you root for Hugh in his own personal crusade . Patterson and co - collaberator Andrew Gross tie everything together in a climatic final battle , discovery , and of course a Patterson plot twist . the plot twist can be see come and come as little surprise to I . while fault could be find in this fact , I still find the Jester well worth the time .

S. Air Force try to shoot down America 's last manned space mission . after that , cropland dry up all over the world , segment of the United States secede but strangely copy the right - wing agenda of the country they be secede from , and the only really sympathetic character , Apollo veteran Marcus White , be euthanize in his nursing home . meanwhile , the hero of the story , Paula Benacerraf and Benjamin Rosenberg , be fly to Titan with three other astronaut who be kill or cripple in nasty way during or before the landing . the new President abandon any effort to bring they home so they know they will die on Titan , but they be determined to get some useful science do and broadcast their finding back to Earth . the focus of the mission change after a giant bolide propel by a chinese nuclear explosion crash into the Atlantic Ocean Rosenberg believe their real mission be to store bacterial spore on Titan in a miraculous lake of liquid water , so they will be warm in billion of year by the expand sun and evolve into some form of life . earth be no long there to return to even if anyone be interested in bring they back . this be one novel which I ' m glad to say be unfilmable without a complete revision of the plot . if I be film this novel I would cast an ex - girlfriend as Paula and her real - life daughter as Paula 's daughter Jackie , who be lucky enough to live in Seattle the Pacific Northwest secede from the US and become New Columbia . the movie would be about how Marcus White start a space program in New Columbia to build spacecraft capable of retrieve the hero from Titan and would end with they be rescue at the last second . the actual ending of the novel beggar belief and be difficult to even describe . there be lot of well book about the exploration of Titan out there . read one of they .",
