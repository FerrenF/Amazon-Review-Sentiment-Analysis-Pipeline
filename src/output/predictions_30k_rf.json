For anyone who had not read that series though it would have not made very much sense at all . Of the four , the last \" A Golden Tree \" I thought made the least sense of all . The story was very disjointed and a lot of it just plain did not work as a story at all . I was kind of confused at the end of the story and it did not really did not explain the ending at all .

Unfortunately the author has followed the path taken by many mystery writers and once he has had success , his writing turns ordinary . I just started reading his first few stand alone volumes and was impressed with the way the author jumped from the past to the present following a few parallel story lines . It was very hard to figure out where it was going next . After 3 stand alone books I jumped ahead to the Jason Kolarich Series . These books are very linear and traditional . Both of the two books that I have read are just gangster novels with fisticuffs , sprinkled with sex and an ending that was telegraphed in the first 100 pages . My readings of Ellis novels has ended . I wonder how the Patterson collaborations turned out since Mr. P is a genius of the cookie - cutter novel . Maybe that 's was the original goal of Mr. Ellis - spend time on his first novels developing characters , plot and style . Then when he has a reputation , start churning out the pablum .",

At first it is so logical and middle of the road sounding that it almost sounds like he is actually approaching the subject from an intelligent standpoint , but then he drops typical ultra - left rhetoric implying that guns are the bad things , rather than the psychos using them for murder . Then there is the assertion that \" high capacity clips \" which is another way of saying higher than ten round magazines cause more death . I am not exactly sure what his point about that was supposed to be because he melded it with his distaste for arming teachers then pointed out that had Lanza had to take time less than a second by the way to reload then maybe , just maybe , principal Hochsprung would have been able to overpower the skinny murderer . but that the AR-15 acted as an equalizer and ended in her death . the point that makes to me is that if she had been similarly equalized with a firearm then 30round man or no she could have shot Lanza dead instead , but he abandons logic at that point in favor of anti - constitution and bill of rights legislation . good read , but poor conclusion .",

The entire Ramsey - Bridgid plot had a lot of potential , but to me was never satisfactorily fleshed out . A separate book would have allowed for some explanation of Gideon 's motives , of Ramsey 's rise to power , and of Bridgid 's early life I think they and we deserved that story . Ransom deserves 3 . 5 stars oh Amazon , give us half stars and even a lukewarm Garwood is better than many of the other romance novels out there .

I was n't quite ready to delve into that monstrous series , and I 'm usually a fan of urban fantasy , so this seemed like a great place to start . Unfortunately , Running With the Demon is more like a Stephen King novel then an urban fantasy . The magic is at a minimum and the suspense and action is practically non existent . The plot is very simple , if an angel type character does n't stop a demon from touching a girl then the world will end . There is a creature trapped in a tree , emotion sucking monsters , and a talking stick figure , but not much else . I found myself skipping over how people were planning on sabotaging a company , how the main character met the stick figure , and other such things . There was simply not enough substance in this book . The plot was predictable , the characters were uninteresting , and there was no depth to this tale . I managed to finish the book , but now I 'm wondering why I really bothered .",

Unfortunately the author has followed the path taken by many mystery writers and once he has had success , his writing turns ordinary .

It was very hard to figure out where it was going next . After 3 stand alone books I jumped ahead to the Jason Kolarich Series . These books are very linear and traditional . Both of the two books that I have read are just gangster novels with fisticuffs , sprinkled with sex and an ending that was telegraphed in the first 100 pages . My readings of Ellis novels has ended . I wonder how the Patterson collaborations turned out since Mr. P is a genius of the cookie - cutter novel .

I admit though , that if one does not know a basic outline of this time period War of the Roses then it will be extremely hard to keep up with the many characters , many of whom have the same name . I appreciated that the author tried to be clear about who each person was - referring to titles and relationships , as well as names , to differentiate all the Richards , Edwards and Margarets .

The reveal of the killer was completely random - I felt like there were no clues or hints or anything leading up to the revelation that Zoe was orchestrating this entire thing . I was suspecting Elsie for a bit and then Fred , and I could tell it was Zoe a few pages before it was revealed . Although I was surprised about Sebastian 's involvement - I feel like that was a good revelation . That being said , I did read the entirety of this book in just one sitting , and it was definitely a page turner for me .

During my reading , my minds eye was easily influenced as the writer brilliantly made everything pictorial in such vivid emotional reality that I can easily imagine Sinatra 's Tailor , being made into a movie . I was left wanting to read the sequel of Umberto 's career and life after arriving in America . His ingenuity , productively manipulative personality , and hard - work ethic would have been intriguing to follow as he must have interfaced with many unique characters in addition to Sinatra . Kudos to the Author , Mark Thompson , and Umberto for making this read delightful and real , for generations to come .",

I believe all books should be able to stand alone , but if a reader has not read the earlier books , the sheer number of characters and relationships would be overwhelming and nearly impossible to follow . Several plot points seemed too coincidental and forced . Ms. Karon is at her best when she focuses on one or two characters and fully creates their immediate world . This one was just too complex and confusing .",

The best material I 've read is part of a book titled , Enoch . The author who also writes poorly but whose mother also had experiences with Sasquatch and is a much better writer uses the works of a man who habituated with Sasquatch in Florida . I could read his journal excerpts all day .",

I only gave it two stars because the plot has some merit , but the execution thereof is sadly lacking . The main character wanders around fluctuating between self pity and revenge . His final action defies logic . And then there is the silent patient who has been ostensibly traumatized , not spoken for many many years , and has been heavily drugged on and off during that time . And yet , when she finally does speak , she becomes completely lucid in a matter of days and has the presence of mind to formulate a rational approach to her situation . And her final act also defies logic . The whole book is a rambling , boring mishmash of the main character 's actions . Again - go read a really good mystery by a really good author .

The story quickly switches to the mensch dwarves , elves , and humans , who have managed to form a lasting peace . They are about to migrate to a new sea moon , until a new enemy appears , demanding a sacrifice to stay their hand . The story continues the transition that began in Fire Sea , humanizing Haplo through a series of quick subplots as he struggles to reconcile who he is with who he thinks he should be . This brings the characters much closer , but also serves as a stalling tactic , postponing the main conflict until other plots have a chance to catch up . The story manages to create some touching moments , but ultimately proves anticlimactic , leaving characters and audiences waiting for the next installment .

The story despite the reasons for all the killing is well written , but some of the killers foreshadowing was never unveiled . It was as if the author had not decided who the killer was and went back to fit in the reasoning . The killer went from highly organized killer to a disorganized one , too quickly . Plus the abusive angle was not believable for the age of the killer , and the abuser . As it is set that the killer is the one with great manipulator skills .

Please take it from an experienced mom and teacher and do n't buy this book . the other ones in this series are great , though .",

The novel is a brief read and perhaps that is part of its downfall . Kaye Gibbons tries to cram too much into too little . People have commented on old Ellen 's actions and what befalls her . Yet some of what occurs in her life is too fantastical to believe , even for a southern novel . She suffers so much at all times , that after a while , the reader is bogged down with no chance of breaking the surface . While Gibbons is able to weave vivid characters such as Ellen 's poor \" friend \" and her elderly aunt , she does n't ground them in reality and they remain unbelievable .",

And , a recent visit to Rome to view archeological sites gave me a good feel for the streets and houses , forums and temples , that these authors describe . I did enjoy this mystery although it 's not as well written as the Falco stories . Flavia seems too modern in attitude to be believable as a daughter of a Roman citizen . The plot is okay , but not exciting and puts no demands on the reader . The history on which the story is based is interesting however , and the festival scenes are amusing . I look forward to reading the future adventures of Flavia .",

This particular collection is of interest to fans of the JSA because it contains the stories that give Wildcat and Mr. Terrific their memberships . Instead of being forgotten heroes of the forties , their legacies live on because of these brief appearances . Roy Thomas 's into explains the events leading up to this change in membership clearly . The main problem with this edition is the art . It is of particularly poor quality by lesser lights , with the exception of Joe Kubert 's wonderful Hawkman segments , and make the stories appear exceptionally amateurish . It 's a shame because the stories themselves are pretty good , especially the one dealing with the heroes being aided by people with disabilities which seems fairly enlightened for the time period .

The novel centers around Gregory Tomasov and his family as they move back to the small town in which Tomasov grew up . This move was made possible after Tomasov won the lottery . But what they do n't realize is that the house they move in to is haunted , and pretty soon it becomes the whole town that is haunted . The spooky events and frights slowly build up and become quite chilly especially when major characters start getting killed . I 'm always a sucker for having a major character that we have grown to know and like suddenly getting killed it 's so much more shocking and thrilling than a minor , nearly nameless nobody biting it . One of the other things that I liked about this novel was how the Molokan religion was a key part of the story but at the same time it was n't thrust on us . The religion was just part of the story and not the \" moral \" that so many other authors make it instead .",

The first 75 pages or so was basically a recap of the previous books that I could have done without , which was mostly voiced by Abby Normal the teen goth minion of the main characters from the first two books . Abby 's voice was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me . She was definitely funny and sparky in a good way , but too repetitive with her dialogue and actions . Still , Bite Me was a hilarious Moore novel that probably ranks in the middle of all his books with Lamb being him in top form and Fluke near the bottom for me . The ending also felt too rushed , but there are plenty of vampire kitties and enjoyable dialogue to push all the right buttons . Bite Me also made me realize how much I missed the Emperor of San Francisco . If you are a Moore fan this will be a must for you .",

If you are keen on falconry , people with dwarfism , neo - Viking gangs , bog bodies , Norse myths , runes , and Chicago , this book is for you .",

This looks like children 's book but it is n't really . I would not recommend this to kids , especially if their parents want to educate them in Christian spirit . Okay , I made a lame joke , but point is , I would recommend book to adult people whose attitude is formed and who are not afraid to hear other people 's opinion . All in all , a good read whose strong point is not in shocking religious people but combining several fresh ideas on theology , philosophy and some other fields . A book for forming young atheists OR interesting opinion ? You decide . Oh , and there is a passage at the end of third book I overlooked which is cleverly put there . Main idea is well hidden . First two books are really easy to read , but third has some puzzles worth thinking .

I especially liked the first few chapters when Kate and Harry were young - quite amusing . I also enjoyed seeing some of the same events from 2 different perspectives . I admit though , that if one does not know a basic outline of this time period War of the Roses then it will be extremely hard to keep up with the many characters , many of whom have the same name . I appreciated that the author tried to be clear about who each person was - referring to titles and relationships , as well as names , to differentiate all the Richards , Edwards and Margarets .

Nora was the older housekeeper of Kyle in the first book and this book picks up from the end of that book as her longtime beau Roman decided on finally to make an honest woman out of her , and enlisted all the kid 's help to mount the perfect wedding . She was hesitant as she did not believe she can love Roman because she gave her heart once to Aiden , her first love . But can she believe in herself again ? As in the first book , this is about sweetness , and fairy tales , with little emotional stakes and conflict . It 's even YAChild friendly except for the innuendos .

This book just does n't seem to have left much of an impression which surprises me because it had an epic \" Man against an empire \" start with a good foundation and characters that might have been great . I think what diminishes this book is the age of many of the characters . The hero is centuries old , as is the empire and as are many of the leading villains . And they feel old in the reading about them . There is a poignant sadness to their actions and relationships that just drags the book . It makes too many sections maudlin . Its not bad , although the action scenes get disjointed more than once , and the power levels of main characters turns battles into massive 1v1 fights rather than tactical and strategic contests . which is n't uncommon in fantasy tales , but it just seems too obvious here , for some reason . I liked this tale , but at the same time , I just did n't care about the characters , the situation or what is to come , and that 's not exactly good . 3 stars for now .

It is certainly important to show Jesus love and care for humanity in practical ways , as almost every one who names the name of Christ does .

It has a little bit of a Hunger Games vibe in that most of the county is uninhabited and there are isolated , controlled areas that produce specific goods resources for the government . I did find some of the other characters to be fairly one dimensional and there were a few grammatical errors in my copy . The world is n't too deep or thought provoking , but following a sanitation worker is a novel idea . The pacing was very good and its a good start for a series I look forward to reading .

I highly recommend the easy to navigate style that takes you from attitudes of conflicts to how our thinking , perceptions and assumptions make us dig in our heels through how we can find the strength , integrity and courage to change the patterns of how to view conflict more constructively . Throughout , the concepts are introduced straight forwardly with a coaching approach that includes thoughtful questions . Moreover , the all important emotional side of conflict is dealt with practically with straight forward strategies . I highly recommend this book as an addition to mediators ' , organizational development practitioners , and conflict coaches'bookshelves . Deborah S. Laufer , Director , Federal ADR Network",

The historic reporting of the LA Central Library fire was intense and riveting , if in reality unsolvable . The personal reflections , were to me , somewhat insipid and pale . It is a positive thing that Orleans explains why libraries mean so much to her , I just did n't find that it did much to enhance the story . At worst it interfered with the rhythm . I also found that the short chapter format created a choppy narrative that bounced from theme to theme and was to me , less than optimal . Perhaps the format is more suitable to the unfolding of a mystery , this was not it . The title is a bit of a misnomer . It is really about Libraries , the sum of all books , rather than just one .",

The chapters were so sparse , and the book is already so thin it did n't allow for a more fully developed storyline . The end of the book left me feeling very unsatisfied , somehow cheated by the cheap ended . It was as if the author had no vision how to bring closure , watched some Hollywood movie and came up with the ending after that .

He discusses the question of the biographer 's empathy with the subject or what subjects should be worthy of a biography , the question of its length and whether its role is to make the reader understand other people . Perhaps when reading a biography there is a desire to find out how one differs from personalities like W. H. Auden , Napoleon or Verdi . But is it worthwhile for the biographer to be tormented by the question of how many grains of salt his subject put on his eggs , as Ximenes Doudan was about Julius Caesar ? Is the Picasso of the blue period really the same man as the one who painted Guernica at the end of his life ? How can the biographer understand the subject 's experiences of which he himself has no experience ? Aside from such reflex ions - even though treated quite superficially - the book contains lengthy observations of the banal habits of a young lady called Isabel Rogers who lives in London and whose biography will interest very few readers indeed .",

He falls in love with a pen pal , who is going to undergo surgery and can become paralyzed . Such is the beginning . True to Victorian times , a large part of the book is spent in Gerard reading old manuscripts , nice short ghostly tales somehow never reaching the finesse that Ms. Byatt achieved in Possession . Perhaps Mr. Harwood did borrow , albeit unconsciously from that book , perhaps not . It is so well written that time and pages fly quickly . Ultimately , everything is neatly tied in with a rather unbelievable climax . Still , a very tidy book . Good ghost stories are hard to come by and the last one was also from Australia , Richard Adams'Watership Down The Girl On The Swing . That was a real spine tingler . This one could have been a stunning novella , in the manner of The Turn of the Screw . Expanding it to a novel length has robbed it of much needed intensity .

It seems that Fodors just phoned in their reviews of France 's various regions and attractions - don't waste your time and definitely do n't lug this book overseas !",

So much of the action takes place in frigid conditions that you might feel the chills as the action propels readers from one cold place to an even colder one . The familiar NUMA cast is back , led by swashbuckling Kurt Austin and his sidekick Joe Zavala . All their skills and the expertise of other recurring characters are drawn into a race to defeat a finely drawn villain , Ryland Lloyd , who is in the final stages of implementing actions that will lead Earth into another ice age . While the formula of this series demands that the good guys win , its a close - run thing that will satisfy those readers who love fast - paced action novels . Rating Four - star I like it",

My complaint with this one was that I wanted MORE ! The characters were all great . They were flawed and real and sometimes evil and unlikable . But I wanted to know more about them . The story line was fabulous ! But I just wanted more of it ! I wanted to know more about Paige and her husband and her brother . I wanted more history of her childhood . I really wanted more of Chloe ! I wanted her story mixed into the rest of the novel . I felt this novel was really shortchanged , Jack Jordan just barely broke the surface of this novels potential . It was a decent read - twisty and shocking . However , it lacked any depth and character development . It felt like there was so much more story to tell .",

While I was looking forward to reading about Catherine of Aragon - books about Henry VIII typically focus on Anne Boleyn and ignore Catherine 's motivations - the execution was poor . First , there were significant implausibilities in the portrayal of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain . Gregory portrays them as rather open minded and solicitous of Islamic practices . Catherine is portrayed as very appreciative of the Muslim legacy of Spain . This is absolutely ridiculous , considering the fact that Ferdinand and Isabella were brutal religious fanatics who sparked the infamous Spanish inquisition . Second , Gregory portrays the relationship between Catherine and Henry VIII 's older brother , Prince Arthur as a love affair . I suppose it is possible , but very unlikely in that time period . Gregory 's purpose , of course , is the key premise of this book - that Catherine of Aragon lied when she said that her marriage to Arthur was not consummated , which means that her marriage to Henry was unlawful under church law . However , the efforts to make this point are rather forced - the romance between Arthur and Catherine reads like a nauseating dime store romance",

Someone so evil , just so sociopathic , that it makes you want to retch takes a master touch to accomplish . But I never felt like the book was really going anywhere .

The writing is also completely dry , reminding official diplomatic report . For someone who 's looking for a better military account I would recommend \" PLA Warfighting \" which is much more detailed on the subject , and also \" Brother Enemy \" by Nayan Chanda which has an easily read narrative , albeit it focuses on the Vietnam invasion of Cambodia December 1978 - January 1979 .",

Very slow methodical plot buildup that is mostly uninteresting . I wonder if the book should have been abridged a little more . Anyway , I am greatful for the abridged version . I never would have made it all the way through the full 1 , 200 page version .",

Zipped through them and just bought all the rest of the series . I liked the books so much , I bought the rest of Donald Wells'books . After reading Taken 50 , I thought the Taken series was over . The man with no name was dead . How could the series continue when he was such a big part of the series ? No fear , The man , now known as Mr. White , which is truly not a name , is alive . The story takes you on a journey to his recovery both physically and mentally . I do n't want to spoil it for you but if you 've read any of the other books in the series , you 'll be very happy with this book . I read it in about 5 hours . I ca n't wait for the next book .

However , what was delivered was a random meandering story with no central plot .

The administration of the roundhouse seems somewhat implausible for an artifact of such interest to humanity , to be sending out missions haphazardly with what appear to be unqualified characters and unclear goals .

I did n't find bravery in many of the stories . Some presidents did shape US policy , but that in itself is not bravery ! It was more like self - preservation . I also did n't like the author 's style of writing . Furthermore , the chapters are not broken down by the name of presidents , so it is difficult to use this book as a cross - reference . I would have liked to see chapters on Clinton and Bush junior . Why did the author choose presidents up to 1989 only ? Why not up to the present day ? This book was after all published in 2007 , so Clinton and Bush could have been included .",

I gave this book 2 stars only because the Hindu mythology and the vague references to it in an attempt to explain some historical findings traditions is interesting . The main plot however starts off at a peak , hot fast and ends in a cold flat dull pit . The story telling is so horribly amateurish I was quite shocked it even got published at such a grand level . I guess being a loaded industrialist helps in that regards . The story seems like it was written by someone in high school who just read Da Vinci Code and was so excited by it he had to find a quick Hindu parallel bang a novella out . That 's why I call this book the Kim K of modern Indian fiction , superficial promise of something spectacular , famous for no good reason , just good marketing put to good use .",

Still , I felt the suspense from the first , and it was my rampant curiosity that kept me going through the entire first part of the novel . Nightfall exhibits little or no character development , so it 's kind of hard to care about these characters . The idea was just so attractive to me that I hung with it , and was somewhat rewarded by some unique monsters and a mythology that developed nicely throughout the novel . The action packed second half of the book is where the chills and horror filled moments come in , and this novel delivered pretty well .

King head hops from the judge 's POV , to Freeman 's to the kidnapper 's to give the reader a good understanding of what is happening and to allow us to develop sympathy for all who are involved . King moves the plot along , and it was hard for me to put the book down . I especially enjoyed the setting in the Florida Everglades . Yet , I found the rationale for the kidnapping to be kind of silly , and Freeman largely was a reduced to the role of gofer while his friend Billy , husband of the kidnapped victim , is the one who does the heavy lifting in terms of solving the identify and motive of the people behind the kidnapping - and he pretty much does it off scene , presenting his conclusions to Freeman as wait accompli .

It is a much easier to read than many futuristic pieces and the settings are vivid although somewhat left to the imagination am I just saying I have a good imagination The novel follows Ender as he completes military training to defeat'The Buggers ' . In order to succeed Ender must survive his murderous brother , fellow students , the games that his superiors play , and eventually the enemy themselves . My problem with the book is that its main drawcard is the ending twist . The rest of the book lacks real tension . The main character is a child prodigy who never looses a battle , so one reads the book without any fear of the protagonist failing or the need for a resolution of tension . The character development is relatively basic , although there are a few satisfying revelations . There are also the occasional interesting philosophies on warfare throughout Ender 's lessons . Ultimately Ender 's Game is an excellent beginning to a series and a relatively easy read . Recommended to sci - fi fans and those who enjoy straightforward books .",

Terry has a habit of regurgitating the same information over and over again in a novel , in a very redundant manner that has the reader skipping through pages because it all becomes so similar . The first four or five Sword of Truth novels were excellent , but the next seven or so suffered this same fate . It 's almost like he is just trying to hit a word quota . The other issue is he goes down political tangents that take us out of the action and into topics we are trying to steer clear of in fantasy and suspense .

    "text": "Pleasant Diversion for an Afternoon . I enjoyed reading \" Do n't Lose Her \" by Jonathon King , but after I finished , I was left with a sense of dissatisfaction . Private Investigator Max Freeman is called in to investigate the kidnapping of the wife of his best friend , a federal judge who is 8 months pregnant . King head hops from the judge 's POV , to Freeman 's to the kidnapper 's to give the reader a good understanding of what is happening and to allow us to develop sympathy for all who are involved . King moves the plot along , and it was hard for me to put the book down . I especially enjoyed the setting in the Florida Everglades . Yet , I found the rationale for the kidnapping to be kind of silly , and Freeman largely was a reduced to the role of gofer while his friend Billy , husband of the kidnapped victim , is the one who does the heavy lifting in terms of solving the identify and motive of the people behind the kidnapping - and he pretty much does it off scene , presenting his conclusions to Freeman as wait accompli .

I appreciated the tight , punchy chapters and changes in point of view which reminded me of World War Z in a highly positive way . I wish I had found out the fate of every character but in the end the broader story was worth it . I say this because The Mansion is the exact opposite . It focuses on a very limited cast of characters in one primary setting . The first chapter was a long , painful , repetitive slog with verbose but uninspiring descriptions of roughing it in a cabin where software was being developed . Sometimes they did n't have electricity but somehow they invented something better than Alexa and better than Google . Ok . Sure . I feel guilty for reviewing something I am having a hard time finishing , but if I can save someone else from this , it 's worth it .",

The constant use of misused words balling vs bawling , shuttered vs shuddered , passed vs past and many more was a problem through the whole story . The writing was also a mixture of third person and present tense which was very confusing at times . It seems the ARC reviewers did n't notice or did n't want to bring to the authors'attention .

A protagonist named Hal living hand to mouth receives a letter about an inheritance . Ware leads Hal to and fro as she considers how to play her hand , which is a skill she has developed as a Tarot card reader . When the magpies arrive on the scene , Agatha Christie fans will feel on familiar ground , albeit without a Miss Marple to straighten everything and everyone out . Instead we have hapless Hal gradually stumbling into jeopardy and reward . I was thoroughly entertained by this novel . Rating Four - star I like it",

Meyer Levin 's COMPULSION , written in 1956 , is a nonfiction novel based on the famous 1924 \" thrill killing \" committed by Nathan Leopold and Robert Loeb . So much has been written about this particular crime , it 's hard for a \" true crime \" aficionado like myself to accept Levin 's portrayal of Leopold and Loeb as fictional characters as Judd and Artie , respectively with complicated thoughts as imagined by Levin that describe their motivations and feelings during and after the crime . The book reissued in modern format is very well written , but Levin 's 1950s style is wordy , resulting in a book that is 456 pages long . It tries the patience of a modern reader accustomed to \" sound bites \" and fast - reading thrillers . Because it is so speculative , and devotes so many pages to Judd 's and Artie 's not - very - convincing inner thoughts , COMPULSION does n't work for me . If I 'm going to read about Leopold and Loeb 's crime , I 'd much rather read a nonfiction account . I rate COMPULSION at 3 stars \" It 's okay \" on the official Amazon scale .",

The designs are easy to follow or to change in many different ways to make them more interesting and creative . This would be an excellent book for someone new to adult coloring books . It has such a variety from easy to intermediate designs and allows for a lot of individuality . It 's a very good starter book . Lots of pros and only one con for me - too many simple designs .

It 's told from Crowe 's perspective and largely in the form of flashbacks to the period surrounding the crime and the trial five years later , as well as a few glimpses into Crowe 's later days circa 70 years old . Hilleman is an evocative writer and does an excellent job portraying early 20th century Omaha , Nebraska and Crowe 's life on the lam . Pat Crowe - aside from one or two incidents - is a fairly likable criminal and it 's the flashbacks to 1900 that are the highlights of this novel .

I was tired of reading her complaints and whining before I had gotten a quarter of the way into the book . The Stay At Home Dad series gets extra points from me because Allen has yet to make Deuce Winters an especially good investigator . In particular in \" Father Knows Death \" he is particularly wide of the mark . Overall the mystery is handled well .

The Veronica Mars from the movie who punched her former classmate in the mouth and said \" Original enough for you ? \" was not the book Veronica Mars who was afraid to go to the gun range .

Tess and Max find an enchanted castle and befriend the boy that lives there named Will . However , all is not as it seems . The three children have a whimsical , fantastic adventure on the night of a full moon , a blood moon and a lunar eclipse that leave Tess and Max wondering what parts were real and what were imagined ! Throughout the story ran a theme of loss and longing , all three children missing a parent . This story had so many lovely elements but also left me with a lot of questions and wanting more . Perhaps the answers will come in the sequel , which I have yet to read . It was a fun , fast read .",

I have to agree with another reviewer that this was the author 's attempt to create'Literature'with a capital'L ' . Once past the initial chapters that author takes a few steps away from the standard archetypes for soldiers and actually develops the main characters , though it occasionally feels a little forced as the story is retold through each character 's eyes .

While I do n't pretend to have perfect grammar myself , I often find my concentration broken by syntax errors in the text . As other reviewers have also mentioned , the chapters seem overly - long and dry and the text is entirely black and white with no colors or pictures . What also stands out are certain organizational issues , which include certain topics popping up every chapter rather than just having one chapter address the subject . Another issue is the authors citing academic research without providing enough context such as not even providing the scholar 's first name .

First , there were significant implausibilities in the portrayal of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain . Gregory portrays them as rather open minded and solicitous of Islamic practices . Catherine is portrayed as very appreciative of the Muslim legacy of Spain . This is absolutely ridiculous , considering the fact that Ferdinand and Isabella were brutal religious fanatics who sparked the infamous Spanish inquisition . Second , Gregory portrays the relationship between Catherine and Henry VIII 's older brother , Prince Arthur as a love affair . I suppose it is possible , but very unlikely in that time period . Gregory 's purpose , of course , is the key premise of this book - that Catherine of Aragon lied when she said that her marriage to Arthur was not consummated , which means that her marriage to Henry was unlawful under church law . However , the efforts to make this point are rather forced - the romance between Arthur and Catherine reads like a nauseating dime store romance",

The real problem for me is that the book is basically three novellas that really only serve the purpose of setting up The Maltese Falcon , by themselves they really do n't have much purpose . Creating scenarios to put the main players in place , Effie , Miles , and Polhaus all make their obligatory appearances in a meandering group of mysteries with a central foe that seems a better fit for a contemporary action movie - a psychopath killer who also can plan complicated capers . It all seems a bit too much for what turns out to be novel with little suspense . Nothing can happen to the main characters and without that possibility , the story needs to exciting and involving . This does n't quite hit the mark . It 's not a total misfire , Gores is a good writer and he keeps things moving , but the end result remains just what you expect .",

Boy , Brady sure has lost a ton of money from the sale of this book . From the forums blogs , it appears that MANY players now feel the book is obsolete , especially since they have already reached level 80 have fully explored Northrend . There is no reason for such a long delay in this book 's release , it 's not like there is a lot of fine detailing that goes into one of these atlases there has n't been any really major Northrend area updates except maybe Uladar . Even then it should n't matter that much since they released the BC atlas without Shadowmoon Valley Quel'Danas . This is really , really sad not good business practices .",

One thing that is to be appreciated is Meg 's surroundings . The scenery , especially the beaches , in Los Angeles is outstanding . The power of the natural world to allow her to recover from trying times ca n't be denied . The strength she demonstrates to persevere is incredible . She does n't give up , run away , or wimp out , ever . All of this is achieved without a lover . I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book",

I 've not met anyone who would respond to life events in the manner these characters did . Not believable at all ! And the whole female impersonator thing was so confusing . By calling a man , she , you never knew for sure who they were talking about and who was speaking . I did not think those characters were very well developed .

There is a very good exploration on the theme of racism , it 's important to the story , making you think during the break neck investigation and exploration of this alternate now that Carey has crafted . My only complaint is that of the 6 issues , there are two issues devoted to a flashback stories and there is no resolution yet !

He based his claims and his theory of Michael 's guilt on supposed \" lab experiments \" that were completely invalid and unreliable , preposterous violations of even the concept of \" experiment . \" So whatever this book persuades a reader to believe , it by definition has to be based at least in very large part on'evidence'as of 2005 that is no longer valid evidence .",

The story follows Rachel , a photographer who is trying to restart her life after being acquitted for the murder of a former art student who stalked her . That 's quite a mouthful , so I 'll wait for you to read it again . Rachel heads home to Texas , where her grandmother , father , and stepmother live . She 's understandably brittle , as some people still think she might have committed the murder as well as other heinous acts . However , she meets Zeke , a man running away from his own past . Can these two people , so beaten down by life , find love ? I think you can probably guess the answer to that one . There were some surprises , which always makes a mystery , well , a mystery . I think that if this had a bit more character development , I would have enjoyed it more . I just could n't care about the characters as much I wanted to . Overall , not a bad read and I will probably check out some of her other books .",

It was well written , paced well , had the types of twists and turns I always like to see in a good mystery - all in all a well told story . But Veronica Mars in \" real life \" is not a wimp , and she came off pretty wimpy in this book . If I were to make a suggestion to the author , I would have suggested more time watching Veronica Mars - which is pretty ironic , I know . I will make one comment that is a minor spoiler , so if you you hate spoilers stop reading now - this just illustrates my point . The Veronica Mars from the movie who punched her former classmate in the mouth and said \" Original enough for you ? \" was not the book Veronica Mars who was afraid to go to the gun range . The Veronica Mars we all know and love would likely have had her concealed carry permit the day after her 18th birthday . So next book , more of the tough , cynical , sparky Veronica , and less of this wimpy Veronica .",

Also , for adult readers with an iota of knowledge about economics , be prepared to sit through a lot of spoon feeding of basic principles for the young adult audience .

The teenagers were definitely the more well rounded characters and it frustrated me that the adults , while trying to prevent suicide in teens , did everything to promote it by not allowing anything but good feelings or off you go to get programmed .

An investment company that profits from the various little conflicts overthrows wars etc between groups worldwide . CI acts much like a venture capital firm of today , they apply the money of their investors into these \" conflicts \" hoping to make the results come out profitable for their investors . Well , if that is not odd enough for you , it gets stranger .

Simple you battle as road warriors to the death of the person who 's job you want . It is a very strange society in this vision of the future . Would I recommend it ? A moderate yes .

A protagonist named Hal living hand to mouth receives a letter about an inheritance . Ware leads Hal to and fro as she considers how to play her hand , which is a skill she has developed as a Tarot card reader . When the magpies arrive on the scene , Agatha Christie fans will feel on familiar ground , albeit without a Miss Marple to straighten everything and everyone out . Instead we have hapless Hal gradually stumbling into jeopardy and reward . I was thoroughly entertained by this novel . Rating Four - star I like it",

I liked the tone , cadence and style of the writing . The claims of empire building in the church are not new to me , and I agree . What I did not like was the misplaced guilt trip and the secular humanistic qualities of the book . Loving and caring for the poor in this world , is NOT the focus of Jesus ministry or the Gospel , as Bell claims . It is certainly important to show Jesus love and care for humanity in practical ways , as almost every one who names the name of Christ does . This message of the arrival of the spiritual kingdom of God is the Gospel . NOT attempting to end the poverty of spirit by a radical demonstration of who Jesus is , yet seeking to implement some form of socialism is a misguided humanist line of thinking .",

I was told by the native speaker not to use this book at all because of all the errors and inaccuracies . I 'm so glad I had this book looked over before using it to learn . I ca n't imagine the embarrassment I would have experienced had I spoken some of these translations to people who speak Punjabi . I would have looked like an idiot . If you want to learn the language properly and learn the proper translation for words then do not purchase this book !",

Dell goes to food to try to take away the emptiness and becomes very overweight . At a party when she is drunk some bad decisions are made too that just add to the horribleness of her life .

I found the sections of the novel in which Gwen dominates are energetic and exciting , while the parts featuring Phil are morose and dull . While both Gwen and Phil are pursuing what they think will make them happy , their differences are striking , and the plot never quite pulled them together in a way that satisfied me . Rating Three - star Its ok",

It has much less to offer in terms of the second part strategies for gaining competitive advantage . Just a few weeks after reading it , I genuinely ca n't recall a single instance of an insight that goes much beyond the obvious of the macro trends . That obvious includes impacts of economic growth , strains of future logistics and widespread inadequacies in existing infrastructures . Yes , agreed . The data the book offers is useful in framing the problem , but rarely gets concrete about such issues as cold storage facilities , transportation industry scale and coordination , costs , telecommunications . It 's all like discussing airline policy without mentioning airplanes .",

The software itself a trial comes with the book seems an awful lot like Photoshop with a lot of preset custom brushes and such , but then lacking the versatility that PS offers to do more than Manga . Perhaps if the book had been dedicated solely to the program , and gone on from the basic - basics into highlighting tips , tricks , and tools more , I would see more value in it . As is , I could n't recommend it .",

I m a third of a way in , but so far African Americans are domestics and assistants while the white people seemingly run the town . Maybe this is what readers like , but for me it seems almost racist . I m going to finish the book and if I change my mind Ill write again .

Josh was an ex military marine sniper who is building up a ranch with fellow ex marine buddies . One look at Tory and he knew she was trouble . Things start happening around the ranch that are unexplainable , and he starts to fall for Tory . I enjoyed this book but I felt the main plot was enough to satisfy a readers hunger , the author tied in other parts that I felt detracted from the story rather than add to it .

Second , I found his diagrams and tabs confusing and frustrating to try to figure out . I finally gave up and started reading the other harmonica book that I ordered at the same time as this one . It is MUCH better . I have n't played the CD that came with this book yet , maybe that will turn out to be the one good thing about ordering this book and save me from thinking that I wasted my money .",

The Flowers mysteries are about a laid back cop working for the wonderfully titled Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension . They feature leisurely action in the rural backwaters of Minnesota . But Storm Front is built around an unbelievable plot involving a stolen artifact , Middle Eastern terrorism , sinister government agents , a disappearing terminal cancer patient , a sexy redneck grifter and so on . At first it 's sort of funny , but soon just boring .",

One would expect that an educated and informed person would have averted predatory loans and would not have spent so far beyond one 's means , but we humans are complicated , and Andrews'story is like that of many others . He divorced , and faced increased expenses by adding his own housing expenses . He remarried , and his costs increased further . Both he and his new wife were reckless with spending and never quite found a productive way of talking about money and spending . For readers who love schadenfreude , Busted will be very satisfying . For fans of reality television , this print version of Cribs might be entertaining . For any reader who wonders about what kind of people get themselves into financial muddles , Andrews and his wife offer some answers but little sympathy because of their selfishness , immaturity and overall recklessness .

In order to succeed Ender must survive his murderous brother , fellow students , the games that his superiors play , and eventually the enemy themselves . My problem with the book is that its main drawcard is the ending twist . The rest of the book lacks real tension . The main character is a child prodigy who never looses a battle , so one reads the book without any fear of the protagonist failing or the need for a resolution of tension . The character development is relatively basic , although there are a few satisfying revelations . There are also the occasional interesting philosophies on warfare throughout Ender 's lessons . Ultimately Ender 's Game is an excellent beginning to a series and a relatively easy read . Recommended to sci - fi fans and those who enjoy straightforward books .",

I tried to take into consideration that this book was originally published in 1954 and so the world and women were completely different especially concerning gender roles .

Every step Blanche took to inching into their lives - Imogene did nothing . She did n't fight back - she did n't try to keep Evelyn she allows it to happen . And then when it finally did come to a show down - all she can do is yell \" how dare you \" a couple of times and that 's it . And the whole thing with Gavin - what a snot nosed little brat . He should have been spanked . The only redeeming thing about the story was her friends Cecil , Hunter , Paul and of course the adorable Tim . Her relationship with Tim - her surrogate son - made up for much . Evelyn was a thoroughly unlikeable character who seemed very self absorbed who needs a woman like Blanche to whip him into shape .

The best part of the book was the way Olsen portrayed the romantic and emotional involvements of several of the women characters with potential serial killers .

However , it may be that as Pixar found success , the author was no longer in the trenches and close enough to provide the play by play he had in earlier chapters . Instead , we suddenly leave the storyline and make a rapid turn toward self - indulgent navel - gazing . Intimate details that had captivated us in early chapters are now replaced by shallow sloganeering and dull philosophizing . Now for my disclaimer . I did n't finish it . Bored , I found myself skipping paragraphs , then pages , and finally deciding to just put it down .

The main character of the story was frustratingly pathetic , could n't make a good decision if it was the only decision she had presented to her , and seemed to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown the entire book . I do n't think she could have been more unlikable . Finally , I love a good plot twist but it seems to me that there has to be at least something to look back on to say \" Ahhh , how did I miss that ? \" when the plot is revealed . Not the case is this book - the final reveal is ridiculous and you realize you just wasted 4 hours of your life .",
